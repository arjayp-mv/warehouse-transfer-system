# V7.2 Forecasting System Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Month Labeling Bug (CRITICAL)
**Problem**: Forecast displayed "Nov 2025" as first month instead of "Oct 2025", causing all seasonal patterns to appear shifted by one month.

**Root Cause**:
- API was calculating start date as `created_date + 1 month`
- Forecast engine was using `datetime.now()`
- This created a mismatch and showed users the wrong months

**Fix**:
- `forecasting_api.py` lines 287-299: Query latest sales month from database, start from month after
- `forecasting.py` lines 255-266: Query latest sales month from database, start from month after
- Both now use: `latest_sales_month + 1 month` for alignment

**Impact**: Month labels now correctly show Oct 2025 as first forecast month (latest sales data is Sep 2025)

### 2. Spike/Outlier Detection (CRITICAL)
**Problem**: One-time spikes (like VP-EU-HF2-FLT's 424 units in July 2025) were being treated as recurring seasonal patterns.

**Root Cause**: Seasonal calculator was averaging all historical data without filtering anomalies.

**Fix**: `seasonal_calculator.py` lines 21-142
- Added `filter_outliers` parameter (default True)
- Implemented Z-score outlier detection (threshold 2.5 standard deviations)
- Removes spikes before calculating seasonal factors
- Tracks `outliers_removed` count in results

**Impact**:
- VP-EU-HF2-FLT July spike of 424 units will be excluded
- Normal pattern (26-40 units) will be used for July forecast
- More accurate seasonal patterns for SKUs with irregular bulk orders

### 3. Historical Data Lookback Window
**Previous**: 24 months (2 years)
**New**: 36 months (3 years)

**Rationale**:
- 3-year window captures 3 full seasonal cycles
- More stable seasonal factor calculation
- Better handles year-to-year variations
- Historical data available: 5.7 years (plenty of data)

**Changes**:
- `seasonal_calculator.py` line 52: Changed from 24 to 36 months
- Confidence calculation updated to reflect 3-year max

### 4. Server-Side Search (UX IMPROVEMENT)
**Problem**: DataTables client-side search only searched current page (100 SKUs). User had to click through pages to find all "ub" SKUs.

**Fix**: Implemented full server-side search
- `forecasting_api.py` lines 201-246: Added `search` parameter to results endpoint
- Searches both sku_id and description fields
- Returns up to 1000 matching results on one page
- `forecasting.html` lines 338-355: Added search input with clear button
- `forecasting.js` lines 111-130, 356-398: Search handlers with 500ms debouncing

**Impact**:
- Searching for "ub" shows all UB- SKUs on one page
- Much better user experience
- No more pagination hunting

### 5. Low Confidence Warnings (UX)
**Problem**: New SKUs (like UB-YTX7A-BS with only 9 months data) showed flat/erratic forecasts without explanation.

**Fix**: `forecasting.js` lines 691-703
- Added warning icon for confidence < 50%
- Tooltip shows "Low confidence - New SKU or insufficient historical data"
- Visual indicator helps users understand why forecast may be unreliable

## Verification Results

### UB-YTX14-BS (Motorcycle Battery)
**Seasonal Pattern (36-month calculation)**:
- Feb: Factor 0.533 (LOW)
- Mar: Factor 1.132 (ramping up)
- Apr: Factor 1.495 (PEAK)
- May: Factor 1.378 (HIGH)
- Jun: Factor 1.507 (PEAK)

**Verdict**: Pattern is CORRECT. March is transition month, April-June are true peaks.

### VP-EU-HF2-FLT
**Before Fix**: July 2026 forecast would be ~424 units (spike from July 2025)
**After Fix**: July 2026 forecast will be ~30-40 units (normal pattern, spike excluded)

### UB-YTX7A-BS
**Status**: New SKU with only 9 months of 2025 data (missing Jan-Feb)
**Behavior**: Forecast shows low confidence (<50%) with warning icon
**Verdict**: Expected behavior - insufficient data for reliable forecast

## Files Modified

**Backend**:
1. `backend/forecasting.py` (lines 234-266)
2. `backend/forecasting_api.py` (lines 201-246, 279-299)
3. `backend/seasonal_calculator.py` (lines 21-142)

**Frontend**:
4. `frontend/forecasting.html` (lines 338-355)
5. `frontend/forecasting.js` (lines 50-134, 356-398, 691-703)

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Generate new forecast and verify Oct 2025 shows as first month (not Nov 2025)
- [ ] Check UB-YTX14-BS March values are correct (~3000 units, factor 1.132)
- [ ] Check VP-EU-HF2-FLT forecast doesn't project July spike
- [ ] Search for "ub" and verify all UB- SKUs appear on one page
- [ ] Verify UB-YTX7A-BS shows low confidence warning icon
- [ ] Test search with partial SKU (e.g., "ytx") and descriptions

## Breaking Changes

None. All changes are backwards compatible.

## Performance Impact

- Server-side search may be slightly slower for large result sets (1000+ SKUs)
- Seasonal calculation now uses 36 months instead of 24 (minimal impact)
- Outlier detection adds minimal overhead (one-time statistical calculation)

## Next Steps

1. Generate fresh forecast with all statuses to test fixes
2. Verify month labels are correct
3. Check seasonal patterns for known SKUs
4. Test search functionality thoroughly
5. Monitor for any regressions
