## V2.0: Enhanced Calculation Engine

This major update introduced sophisticated demand prediction capabilities, significantly improving accuracy.

### Features Implemented

**Advanced Stockout Correction**:
- Implemented Year-over-Year demand lookups for SKUs with no recent sales history
- Added category average fallbacks for more intelligent demand estimation
- Enhanced zero-sales handling with historical pattern analysis

**Seasonal Pattern Detection**:
- Automatically classifies SKUs into seasonal patterns (spring_summer, holiday, etc.)
- Uses 2+ years of historical data for pattern detection
- Applies predictive demand multipliers based on detected patterns

**Viral Growth Detection**:
- Identifies rapidly growing (viral) products by analyzing recent sales trends
- Detects declining products for inventory optimization
- Adjusts transfer priorities based on growth trajectory

---

## V3.0: Enhanced Transfer Logic & UI

Building on V2.0, this version refined transfer logic to be more proactive and transparent, and dramatically improved the user interface.

### Proactive Inventory Management

**Seasonal Pre-positioning**:
- Automatically increases transfer recommendations 1-2 months ahead of detected seasonal peaks
- Prevents stockouts during high-demand periods
- Optimizes inventory placement based on historical patterns

**Burnaby Retention Logic**:
- Prevents transfers that would leave source warehouse critically understocked
- Maintains configurable 2-month safety stock at Burnaby
- Balances transfer needs with source warehouse requirements

### Intelligent Prioritization & Justification

**Priority Scoring System**:
- Weighted 100-point algorithm ranking transfer urgency
- Factors: stockout days, coverage ratio, ABC class, growth status
- Provides clear prioritization for transfer execution

**Detailed Transfer Reasons**:
- Auto-generates business-focused explanations for every recommendation
- Example: "CRITICAL: Class A item with 20+ stockout days and low coverage"
- Helps users understand and trust recommendations

### Enhanced SKU Details Modal (Week 10)

**Comprehensive Analysis Hub**:
- Transformed modal into expanded layout (modal-xl)
- Added interactive Chart.js graphs showing sales trends
- Highlighted stockout periods in visualizations
- Integrated current inventory and pending orders
- Added arrival date estimates for pending orders
- Full sales history display with filtering

**Export Functionality**:
- Export sales history for single SKU
- Export all SKUs data for comprehensive analysis
- CSV and Excel format support

### Technical Implementation Details

**Problem Solved**:
- Initial implementation tried to access input fields that didn't exist when columns were locked
- Solution: Check lock state first, get values from recommendationsData for locked columns

**Database Integration**:
- CA/KY order quantities properly saved to transfer_confirmations table
- Data persists correctly across page reloads

**UI Behavior**:
- Lock All button shows lock icon when any column unlocked
- Shows unlock icon when all columns locked
- Handles all partial lock state combinations correctly

## V4.2: Fix Duplicate SKU Issue in Transfer Planning

### Problem Analysis
The transfer planning page displayed duplicate entries for certain SKUs due to improper SQL JOINs with the stockout_dates table:
- **PF-13906**: 6 duplicate entries
- **WF-RO-GAC10**: 2 duplicate entries
- **VP-EU-HF2-FLT**: 2 duplicate entries

### Root Cause
The SQL query in `backend/calculations.py` (function `calculate_all_transfer_recommendations`) used LEFT JOINs with the `stockout_dates` table without proper aggregation. When an SKU had multiple stockout records (different warehouses or unresolved events), the LEFT JOIN created duplicate rows.

### Solution Implemented
Replaced LEFT JOINs with EXISTS subqueries for stockout status checks. This ensures one row per SKU while maintaining accurate stockout status information.

### Implementation Tasks

**Completed Tasks**:
- [x] TASK-096: Document the duplicate SKU issue and solution approach in TASKS.md
- [x] TASK-097: Fix SQL query in calculations.py by replacing LEFT JOIN with EXISTS subqueries
- [x] TASK-098: Add comprehensive code documentation explaining the fix and rationale
- [x] TASK-099: Test with Playwright MCP to verify duplicate elimination and functionality
- [x] TASK-100: Verify data integrity, stockout status accuracy, and performance impact

### Technical Solution Details

**SQL Query Fix**:
```sql
-- Before: LEFT JOIN causing duplicates
LEFT JOIN stockout_dates sd ON s.sku_id = sd.sku_id

-- After: EXISTS subquery preventing duplicates
WHERE EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM stockout_dates
    WHERE sku_id = s.sku_id AND warehouse = 'Kentucky'
) AS kentucky_stockout
```

**Benefits**:
- Eliminated duplicate SKU entries in transfer planning table
- Maintained accurate stockout status flags
- Improved query performance (no need for DISTINCT)
- Cleaner, more maintainable SQL code

### Testing Results
- PF-13906 now appears only once in transfer planning table
- WF-RO-GAC10 appears only once with correct stockout status
- VP-EU-HF2-FLT appears only once with accurate data
- All stockout status badges display correctly
- Performance maintained with 4000+ SKU dataset
- No SKUs missing from results after fix
- Transfer calculations remain accurate
