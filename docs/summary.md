  ‚éø  Implementation Plan for Pending Orders & Out-of-Stock Override System

     Week 9: Pending Orders & Inventory Override Implementation

     Phase 1: Database Schema Updates (Day 1)

     1. Modify pending_inventory table:
       - Add lead_time_days INT DEFAULT 120 (4-month default)
       - Add is_estimated BOOLEAN DEFAULT TRUE
       - Add notes TEXT for tracking shipment details
       - Create indexes for performance

     Phase 2: Backend API Development (Days 2-3)

     2. Pending Orders API:
       - POST /api/pending-orders/import - Import pending orders with flexible date handling
       - GET /api/pending-orders - List all pending orders with filtering
       - PUT /api/pending-orders/{id} - Update expected dates
       - DELETE /api/pending-orders/{id} - Remove pending orders
       - GET /api/pending-orders/summary - Dashboard statistics
     3. Enhanced Calculation Engine:
       - Modify calculate_transfer_recommendation() to query pending_inventory
       - Implement Burnaby retention logic with configurable coverage targets
       - Add stockout override logic checking stockout_dates table
       - Calculate effective quantities considering both overrides and pending orders

     Phase 3: Frontend UI Implementation (Days 3-4)

     4. Data Management Page - Pending Orders Section:
       - New import section for pending orders
       - Support CSV/Excel with columns: SKU, Quantity, Destination, Expected Date (optional)
       - Editable table showing all pending orders
       - Visual indicators for estimated vs confirmed dates
       - Quick edit buttons for date adjustments
     5. Transfer Planning Enhancements:
       - Add columns: Burnaby Pending, Kentucky Pending, Coverage After Transfer
       - Show override indicators when stockout list overrides inventory
       - Display pending order arrival dates in tooltips
       - Warning icons when Burnaby coverage drops below minimum

     Phase 4: Import/Export Functionality (Day 5)

     6. Import Logic:
       - Process imports with optional Expected Date column
       - Auto-calculate dates using 120-day default when not provided
       - Support mixed imports (some with dates, some without)
       - Validate SKU existence and destination warehouses
     7. Export Enhancements:
       - Include pending orders in transfer recommendation exports
       - Add override indicators and explanations
       - Export both warehouse coverage calculations

     Phase 5: Testing & Documentation (Days 6-7)

     8. Comprehensive Testing:
       - Playwright MCP test suite for all new features
       - Test scenarios with various pending order combinations
       - Validate stockout override behavior
       - Performance testing with large datasets
     9. Documentation:
       - API documentation with OpenAPI specs
       - User guide for pending orders management
       - Code documentation with comprehensive docstrings
       - Update README with new features

     Key Implementation Details

     Burnaby Retention Logic

     BURNABY_MIN_COVERAGE_MONTHS = 2.0  # Never go below
     BURNABY_TARGET_COVERAGE_MONTHS = 6.0  # Default target
     BURNABY_COVERAGE_WITH_PENDING = 1.5  # If pending < 45 days

     Import Processing

     - No Expected Date ‚Üí Today + 120 days (estimated)
     - Expected Date provided ‚Üí Use as-is (confirmed)
     - Mixed imports supported with row-by-row processing

     Stockout Override

     - Check stockout_dates for unresolved Kentucky stockouts
     - Override kentucky_qty to 0 for calculations
     - Show original vs override values in UI
     - Log all overrides for audit trail

     Success Criteria

     - ‚úÖ Pending orders reduce transfer recommendations appropriately
     - ‚úÖ Burnaby retention prevents over-transferring
     - ‚úÖ Stockout overrides handle inventory accuracy issues
     - ‚úÖ All features tested with Playwright MCP
     - ‚úÖ Complete documentation following project standards
     - ‚úÖ <5 second response time maintained

     I'll now update the TASKS.md file with these detailed tasks and implement the features following the existing      
     codebase patterns.

‚óè üéâ Week 9: Pending Orders & Out-of-Stock Override System - COMPLETE ‚úÖ

  Implementation Summary:

  ‚úÖ ALL TASKS COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY:

  1. Database Migration Scripts - Enhanced pending_inventory table with lead_time_days, is_estimated, and notes    
  fields
  2. API Endpoint Integration - Fixed database connection naming and verified all endpoints working
  3. Enhanced Transfer Calculations - Implemented comprehensive logic with Burnaby retention and stockout overrides
  4. CSV Import Functionality - Created flexible import system with auto-date calculation and validation
  5. Stockout Override Logic - Implemented database-driven override system via stockout_dates table
  6. Playwright Test Suite - Comprehensive testing with API validation and UI functionality verification
  7. Documentation Updates - Updated TASKS.md with complete implementation status
