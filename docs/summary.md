‚óè Testing Results Summary

  Based on the comprehensive Playwright MCP testing, here are my findings:

  ‚úÖ Successfully Implemented Features:

  1. Modal Size Enhancement: Modal is now modal-xl - much larger and more spacious
  2. Enhanced Layout: Beautiful 3-column grid with Basic Information, Current Inventory, and Pending Inventory
  3. Reason Column Fix: Text wrapping works correctly - full reason text is visible
  4. Pending Inventory Display: Shows quantities with colored badges and days until arrival (120 days, 78 days)
  5. Sales History Enhancements: Total column added with bold formatting, stockout indicators (SO: 7d, 1d, 5d)
  6. Frontend Export UI: Export buttons are present and styled correctly

  üî¥ Issues Identified:

  1. Backend Export Endpoints Missing: The API endpoints /api/export/sales-history/{sku_id} and /api/export/all-sales-history were not actually       
  implemented in main.py
  2. Chart.js Not Rendering: Chart.js library loads correctly, but the chart canvas/div is not being created in the modal

  üìä Testing Results:

  - ‚úÖ Modal opens and displays enhanced information
  - ‚úÖ Pending inventory shows correct calculations (120 days, 78 days to arrival)
  - ‚úÖ Sales history table shows Total column with proper formatting
  - ‚úÖ Stockout indicators display correctly (7 days, 5 days, 1 day)
  - ‚úÖ Layout is responsive and well-organized
  - ‚ùå Export functionality fails with 404 errors
  - ‚ùå Sales trend chart not visible (missing chart div)

  The core UI enhancements are working perfectly, but the export functionality and chart visualization need completion. The modal enhancement has     
  successfully transformed from a basic information display to a comprehensive SKU analysis interface.
