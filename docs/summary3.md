 ‚úÖ Completed Tasks:

  1. Enhanced Import Method: Updated _import_inventory_data() with detailed error tracking
  2. Line Number Tracking: Each CSV row is tracked with its original line number (accounting for header)
  3. Specific Error Categories:
    - SKU_NOT_IN_MASTER: SKU doesn't exist in master table
    - DUPLICATE_IN_FILE: SKU appears multiple times in CSV
    - INVALID_DATA: Negative quantities or other data issues
    - DATABASE_ERROR: Individual database operation failures
    - PARTIAL_DATA_NEW_SKU: New SKU missing required warehouse data
  4. Detailed Response Format: Enhanced CSV import to return structured results with:
    - import_summary: Total counts of successful/failed/skipped rows
    - import_details: Array with line-by-line status and error information
    - Error categorization and specific error messages
  5. Frontend Enhancement: Updated to display:
    - Summary statistics with failed/successful/skipped counts
    - Detailed tables showing failed items with line numbers and error categories
    - Export functionality for failed SKUs
    - Visual indicators and badges for error types
  6. Pre-validation: Added upfront SKU validation against master table to prevent foreign key violations

  Key Features:

  - Partial Success: Valid SKUs import successfully even if some fail
  - Detailed Reporting: User can see exactly which line and SKU failed with specific reason
  - Export Failed Items: CSV export of failed SKUs for review/correction
  - No Automatic Creation: Respects user requirement to not auto-create missing SKUs
  - Comprehensive Logging: Backend logs detailed import progress and results

  The solution now provides exactly what the user requested: detailed error reporting showing which lines/SKUs failed to import and why, allowing them to        
  decide whether to create missing SKUs or ignore them, while successfully importing all valid data.

  ‚óè Sales Data Import Fix Complete ‚úÖ

  I have successfully implemented comprehensive improvements to the sales data import functionality:

  üîß Issues Fixed:

  1. Foreign Key Constraint Error - Added pre-validation to check SKUs exist before importing       
  2. Enhanced Error Reporting - Added detailed line-by-line tracking of import success/failure      
  3. Duplicate Handling Confirmed - Verified that ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE correctly overwrites data (10 stays 10, not 10+10=20)

  üöÄ New Features Added:

  - Line-by-line import tracking with specific error categories
  - Pre-validation of SKUs against master table to prevent foreign key violations
  - Detailed import summary showing successful, failed, and skipped records
  - Actionable error messages (e.g., "SKU XXX not found - add to master SKU list first")
  - Enhanced frontend error display with tables showing failed items by line number

  üìä Error Categories:

  - SKU_NOT_IN_MASTER - SKU doesn't exist in master table
  - DUPLICATE_IN_FILE - Same SKU+year_month appears multiple times in file
  - INVALID_DATA - Negative sales values or invalid stockout days
  - DATABASE_ERROR - Database-specific errors

  ‚úÖ Testing Results:

  - Small file test: ‚úÖ Works correctly (1 record imported successfully)
  - Duplicate handling: ‚úÖ Confirmed - uses ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE to overwrite, not add
  - Error reporting: ‚úÖ Enhanced with detailed feedback

  The fix ensures that:
  - When you re-upload the same file, SKUs with 10 sales stay at 10 (not 20)
  - You get clear feedback about which SKUs succeeded vs failed
  - Missing SKUs are identified with actionable error messages
  - The import process is robust and provides detailed reporting

  Next Steps: The enhanced error reporting will now show you exactly which SKUs need to be added to the master table first, making it much easier to resolve     
  import issues.
