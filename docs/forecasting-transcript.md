all right welcome to forecasting expert my new method after working for 15 years I'm ready to unveil the way I'm working the way I was working the last 15 years from Warehouse training to a director consultant and also with all uh the knowledge and tools and methods I got from you but also from the expert like my friend Mario from Amazon so what are we going to do in this uh in this metal you are the new forecasting expert of this company from L Armstrong called I will Will Survive and yes they have to survive and you have to survive why because this compan is in trouble uh this companies Distributing bicycle bikes products in the US and they have a lot of first they have a lot of tensions because they're not making their their goals their financial goals they have a lot of stress between every Department between Finance Marketing sales HR warehouse and production in China they have a lot of stress and that was my reality when I joined when I became for example s sop manager or Supply share manager I was in this position with no visibility a lot of stress and tension and only a very short time to improve my performance and that's what we're going to do the next four weeks I really want to give you the real examples and tools that you can Implement immediately to improve the situation in your own company so it's very important that you practice with me you repeat my example and then you can apply to your company let's start the story immediately see you in the next episode
welcome to iwh survive I recruited you to save my company I created this company many years ago after an exciting career in the tour to France even if I didn't like the end of the story the pandemic a few years ago created a lot of challenges and we had a very bad situation after that with negative growth right now we don't have any visibility between the macro forecast and the micro forecast between sales marketing HR Logistics and production the tension between all the Departments is very high people spend too much time firefighting instead of improving the situation I need you to simplify give us more visibility reunify all the process improve the forecast accuracy the return on investment for the shareholders the level of stress in the company and deliver more service to our customers you have four weeks to improve the situation if this is not the case in four weeks I will have to take a radical decision and maybe even close the company good luck
welcome to I Will Survive the company run by glance Armstrong the situation is pretty bad as you can see and we need your help we need a forecasting expert to to give more visibility to this company and improve all the forecasting process so we have glong as you know we have been a live as a CFO very stress about cash flow we do have Lady Gaga litics the marketing director she only wants to focus about creativity and she wants to launch a new a new collection of very colorful closing for the next season we're going to talk about it we do have jff amazes the logistic director he's very concerned about the volatility and the the the lack of visibility for his team we have Elon M the product director wants to reshape the industry with new products he's talking about new flying bicycle for the next season as well we have Jack machine the production director who have most of the production and Manufacturing in in China with very long lead time so he's very stressed about visibility and capacity we have Mark zuuk carebook the IT director which really only care about his it system and he doesn't want to hear anything regarding to Excel spreadsheet we have Leonard Wolf the sales director who only cares about the bonus and he only wants to sell and we have Michelle Baker the who only care not only she cares about people so this is the team we have the products of the company we do have the at the beginning was only like bicycle products that glance samstrong was using for the tour to France uh so Rod bike then they switch to mountain bike then electric bike you will see that this collection of electric bike is growing very fast the last few years we're going to go back to all the data after we have also accessories such as like Stone locks lights helmets and there is a collection of closings which is uh very promising from the the marketing director point of view so this is the products we have 100 of products that we're going to play with uh with real data set and the supply chain Manufacturing in China most of the time with very long lad time the distribution is in the US with one main distribution center and then multi multiple clients Amazon Walmart and Rich Pony good companies so this is the way we're going to play the way we're going to work and the situation is pretty bad so as you can see this is the gross over the last few few years it was plus 5 plus 2% then the pandemic happened with a massive surge of the sales but after that everyone was thinking okay this is the new the new normal we're going to sell as much every year but that was not the case and the year after minus 18% minus 2% and this year the target was at least to do plus 10% but the year to date since the beginning of the year the company is only growing by 0% so the situation is pretty bad and you have only four weeks to save the company to give more visibility to improve the accuracy and save the baby of glance Armstrong so you will have your first meeting very soon get ready for that there is a lot of stress and tension but not wor You are not alone this time maybe you have the same situation in your company maybe you are you are a bit stressed overwhelmed you don't have time for anything but this time we're going to take care of you we're going to provide you the full forecasting expert method to help you to generate more accurate forecast in less than four weeks
[Music] am I connected this meeting better be hey there you are thank you for joining us for this meeting already we can't hear each other speak with all this noise let me just mute everyone so we can get started hello everyone I wanted to introduce to you to our new forecasting expert his mission is very clear save the company we brought him on board to get our forecasting in order he will be meeting with each of you individually but I wanted to have this meeting so you can share your main challenge today with him and the rest of the team thank you I will get things started in the Chief Financial Officer I can tell you we have a big problem with the cash flow and the budget in this company we have a huge gap between our financial forecast and the product forecast so please help us we need to have visibility very quickly sales and marketing always tend to over forecast but we end up never reaching targets and then everyone complains hello I'm the sales director and yes I can confirm we are not making our Target and we have recently been over forecasting I didn't even get any bonus last year and this year doesn't look great I know everyone is asking me to have a 12- Monon forecast but my job is to sell not to spend my day working in Excel uh I wish I could forecast more accurately but that is not my job uh I'm here to be with clients not spend my day diving into complex Excel formulas same for me I'm also tired of talking about forecasting I'm the marketing director I just want to do great product launches and promotions with my team we have amazing creative ideas but every single year we have poor launch execution I want to spend my time creating not having endless meetings to analyze forecast numbers I don't know how to use Excel please keep things simple for us I couldn't agree more with my colleague from marketing we have a very poor launch execution I'm sure you already know but I am the product manager by the way I am not trying to slowly raise our market shares every year I am here to revolutionize the ENT ire bicycle Market I'm really excited about my new flying bike design but I'm just not sure this company is able to cope with my vision the problems often come from the production and Logistics side of the company they are never able to provide what we need when we need it of course the problem couldn't come from your department hi everyone my name is Jack and IM the production director I'm tired of always having changes in the forecast I'm sorry but I can't launch a new product in less than 3 months I have a full of lead time for my components plus whenever you have a new genius idea you never use the same components you are always trying to reinvent the wheel your forus has so much volatility I cannot modify in an instant the production capacity of my factory all I need is stability to produce at the best price with as much stability as I can I agree with Jack from production and the logistics director and the last few years have been a roller coaster for us we have too much vola utility and we can't allocate the right people at the right time to provide service to our customers we need shortterm and long-term visibility I don't want to have to hire and fire more people this year hey guys all I know is that I hear everyone complaining about our systems but it is not that simple to change our Erp we set it up 10 years ago and I haven't seen anyone raise a single ticket on the system when they have an issue I know everyone has their own Excel file so how are you expecting us to help anymore if we decided to change Erp it would take at least 3 years I'm sorry to hear all this Mark but to be completely transparent with you and everybody here with how things are going we don't have three years ahead of us I couldn't agree more if these issues are not resolved quickly we don't even at 6 month thank you everyone for sharing your concerns I am the Director of Human Resources and my main focus is the people in this company last year was dramatic we had to recruit without visibility and then fire so many people as you can see we all have so much stress please help us bring back some peace into this company thank you everyone for sharing your concerns you will be meeting with our new forecasting expert individually in the next few days so now I think you can understand the situation my company is in and the importance of your mission we believe you are the ideal person to bring order to our forecast please don't let us down
all right so before we start forecasting and start the method I think it was good to to share how we became expert me and and Mario hello Mario welcome to the course hi thank you and the idea was like Mario we were just chatting before what do you mean by this can you explain why you were saying to us before yes I was saying practice doesn't make you perfect but perfect practice makes you perfect it means basically is it's not just about spending time or something because you can spend countless hours and not improving but you have to spend time in the right way okay you need the right strategy and you have to do the right things to make really practice worth it okay and deliver results yeah General and we've been practicing for the last 15 years and I think one of the most important part it's not only about firefighting if really it's about practicing with the right project and also the right company and that's how we met we met in this company called Deaton you probably know this company if you are on this planet maybe not in the US but this is one of the biggest Global retail sport company uh and they have a very vertical supply chain from production to distribution and uh that's how we met I was in supply chain you were in finance supply chain implementing piloting and Reporting tools for for the for the company and the B of your boss told me to to meet you and uh because you are very smart and good with numbers and uh this uh colleagues relationship became a friendship and we had only few pictures where we opening our eyes but this is for another topic what is important I think is to what you said before is like we practice a lot over the last 15 years this is me 15 years ago and on my side before talking about you I became an exper because um I started from the the ground warehous worker I had the chance like you to have amazing projects working for theat early in my career implementing forecasting and inventory management models for of stores and um big numbers of DC distribution centers I became demand planner then manager in Brazil then snop management director in Australia before studying at the ABC Supply Chain school and Jour as a consultant and now as a teacher and um and that's that's the what happened for me the last 15 years and you probably already know ABC splain from the webinar from my previous course what about you Mario can you tell us how do you what is your journey with forecasting sure sure uh my journey I started with actually with uh Investment Banking m&a and then uh the trading floor and then I I quickly moved to supply chain uh I started in decathlon as a a finance Finance controller in supply chain and then quickly move to demand planner and then uh change uh company move to Amazon as demand planner for the shoes category uh overall Europe and then um after 9 month uh then moved to forecasting so I was responsible for the entire forecasting of Amazon in Europe in particular improving improving the the the the the algorithms not not not coding the algorithms themselves but give to the technical team hints and uh idea to basically improve the algorithms especially because Europe is a pretty specific country with like five smaller countries instead of the US which is just a big one yeah um and then I was also responsible for actually I set up a process uh to allow people to override the forecast but with certain constraints with certain boundaries just to be sure they they don't actually end up doing um achieving a worse accuracy than than the system itself okay yeah yeah yeah and at the end so you were at the end you were responsible to improve the the fusing process because it was not only about the the formula of the model right yeah I I was responsible improving the accuracy overall okay and then meaning that the the accuracy comes from the system plus the overrides that are performed by users so I was achieving this through a mix of both okay okay so I think because you did that for five years I think we're going to get we're going to reveal a lot of insights and secrets that's going to be very helpful for you not only because uh you we don't we we are not we not necessarily need to use machine learning to improve our forus accuracy but I'm you will be very Amazed by the number of like concrete action we can Implement immediately for for your fusting process as well and at the end we will have the best of us I have a very holistic downto Earth approach because I was a manager was a firefighter like you and you have the the mathematical finance and the future approach from Amazon uh in the same place in the same course and that's that's what we're going to talk about the conclusion is we go back to what we said at the beginning practice doesn't make you perfect but perfect practice makes you perfect and that's what we're going to do we're going to practice a lot with real examples together with me and and mayo and the idea is to start focusing as soon as possible measure analyze and improve your accuracy and your performance as fast as possible
all right so now the question after talking about me and Mayu how are you going to become a forecasting expert that's a really good question and I can tell you there is a big gap between winners and losers the winners are the one with the right skills they expert they top performers and the one with no like strong skills they will they will basically have difficulty with competition they won't bring enough value to the company they will have more stress and of course also low salary and my goal and the goal of this method is really to help you to be part of the winners to become an expert and you will see the next few years the gap between these two category will increase a lot and I I could see the difference with me over the last 10 and 15 years the real things for me what is really important for this method is I really want you to focus on what you can impact you cannot really impact what's happening in the world or maybe the uncertainty of the demand on your industry maybe you can impact your company if you're the CEO but maybe you're not the CEO and May really the attention is really to focus where you have an impact in your team and you directly what are the tools the methods and the actions you can Implement every day to have results quickly not in four years but in four weeks only okay so the focus also is really to get focus on this method we're going to use a lot of example it's going to be fun so you can my goal is really that you enjoy this journey and you you have more fun learning with me that doing your own work in your company but maybe you have to reduce a a bit of Instagram social media Netflix these few hours will really change your skills your performance and I hope they will also boost your career and the performance of your company I recommend for that that you lock some learning times in your calendar I always do that if you don't plan in advance where you're going to learn when you won't do it because you know you have probably way too many priorities with way too many in your personal life as well maybe you have kids maybe you have two jobs in the same time and I can tell you if you don't in advance you may lose the focus and you may say you know what I don't have time this week or I'm very tired so what I do what I always do in my calendar I say you know what I'm going to start my day by learning the first time is for myself not for the other people around me so I'm going to learn first maybe I'm going to wake up a bit earlier maybe I'm going to go to work a bit later maybe I'm going to learn from work in the meeting room you don't have to tell anyone but Lu sometime in your calendar at the end we only ask you to commit from 3 to 5 hours a week which is not crazy and if you really don't have the time at least lock one or two hours a week because you will have immediate results and you're going to save also a lot of time by implementing our tools and Method so keep focused no distraction I try to learn without any phone any notification no email no phone that's something very important and that's one of my I think one of my specialties is really I know how to focus and go deeply when I need okay so practice also as much as you can as we say with my before you have to practice practice practice and we're going to give you the right examples to practice in the right condition so focus on problems repetitive task projects simplification data cleansing automation don't wait to be 100% perfect I see so many people because they have oh I don't have the perfect data I'm going to wait don't wait okay I'm going to go back to this do mistakes and cor correct them but the most important for me is to be in movement if you're willing to improve your situation for the F years you have to move and the more you will move and build the more you will analyze and improve yourself that's the best way to learn we could do do it for forecasting but also for sport if you don't practice if you don't play soccer if you don't run you want to improve your capability okay also very important we're going to give you multiple Solutions but there is always different solutions I don't have the absolute truth of forecasting of course but at the end you will have to find your way what do you like what is resonating with with me and our method what is maybe too complex at the end I recommend to keep it as simple as possible and really focus on the outcome maybe you will use only 20% of what I'm going to teach you but that will be probably enough to improve significantly the performance of your forecast okay so refuse as well repetitive task if you feel you are always doing the same thing and it's very exhausting refuse that and try to automate as much as possible we're going to go back to this and to congratulate you to finish this method because at the end the question is to become an expert you will have to complete this method and it's not it's not such a long time I I resumed 15 years of experience me and mayo and all my members into like something like 15 to 20 hours of practice and by doing that we're going to give you you have one year to complete the method and if you complete the method within one year hopefully only in a few weeks we're going to give you another four years access with all the e update that we're going to provide and I can tell you we have a lot of things happening on the forecasting field so that's the gift we want to give you and at the end I just want you to enjoy and have fun learning with us
so now let's talk about the eight steps to focusing Excellence eight steps that we're going to do during this full method the first one is to Define your goals I see so many people ask me what is the best formula Ed what is the best tool but you don't even know what you are looking for so you can really go back to the basics you're going to meet the whole Board of director one by one and we're going to see okay what these people really want what do they need and you will have to consolidate and see okay this is what are my goals the next few weeks to improve the situation the second one is you will have to collect and transform data this is a big part as well if you don't have any data you can do anything but before before like going into formulas we need to know what is possible to get to transform to clean as well and that's what we're going to do number three we have to choose a forecasting model or formula we're going to tell you which one is the best for you according to your level of maturity from very basic to very Advanced then we're going to forecast we have this is a big chapter we're going to forecast the Baseline then we're going to do the new products and the promotions the idea is really to practice once again and to tune by also in the step number five which are all these one are very connected we're going to measure we're going to track the accuracy and and see what is the best model what is the one giving you the best accuracy and then you're going to probably maybe change your model and the the idea is really to have this continuous Improvement Loop all the time then we have to automate the process it's great to have a process but it's very manual regarding the tools but also the process to forecast with your team so we're going to focus to make this process as automated as possible then we're going to empower your teams it's not only about forecasting it's about how to communicate Empower your team the different departments I was an snop manager for for many years I was a facilitator and the goal was really to embrace and to educate everyone around me that we were all on the same page so this is also a very important topic that many people forget and then we're going to prepare for the future because the goal is to improve your forecasting skills and performance in four weeks but it's also important to build the foundation for the future so we're going to talk about Innovations technologies that we're going to cover with me and Mario what is important at the end in this process you see you have we're going to talk about methods how to communicate or to deal with people and ego and also we're going to talk about tools so this is a very holistic approach that we're going to cover together and I'm very excited to share it with you
so before jumping into the first step of the process I think what is important for us and for me to go back to what is the right system or tool to forecast that's a very important question and when I ask to my members this is just one survey from lincolin for example we can see that two3 of the of the expert are using Excel one third erpn forecasting software and then only few of do python or machine learning okay so this is uh this is a very important question and I really wanted to to highlight that most of the company in the world they use Excel to support their infrastructure to support the way they work why because this is a very accessible and flexible tool for me this is more an universal language it's like speaking English we all use Excel as well and this is not a shame to use this tool even Amazon if you as to my friend Mario from Amazon he was also using Excel not as an ARP but as a tool to analyze take the right decision and improve the system so don't feel guilty if you have Excel today and this going to be the main tool we use to uh clearly train you and to practice with real data why because my goal is to improve your your forast accuracy in four weeks not in four years and I've been running a lot of project with SIP and net Erp system you cannot change anything in four weeks let's be just realistic that's why I want to focus on something we all use that you can use to raise improve the your skills but also bring immediate result to your company and of course you will have the possibility to change and update all these new skills into your system if you need so the first solution of course you can improve your current Erp this is for example sap or or Oracle orac and clearly this is a these tools are not very friendly user for most of them especially the the big ones but you can always improve and I was an EIP project manager and my goal was to improve and automate the task especially in forecasting and supply chain but I was always starting with Excel and then when I had the budget approve after a few months I will uh I will update this tool or you can also learn how to use them better but for that we have a lot of focusing skills that you're going to learn and then you will make much more sense when we're going to talk about seasonality Trends you will be able to connect the dots the second option is to connect to a forecasting software so this is a new trend right now because it's too complicated to change yourp you have many companies that can connect your forecasting software and they're going to provide you a forecast so this is I think much faster than changing yourp for sure for most of these tools I feel they're more efficient because they're very focusing on forecasting but sometimes it's just a blackbox and I I know many members that tell me Ed I have this forecasting software I have no idea how it works but at the end we don't really know so we don't really trust so at the end we go back to excel so we have many many options that I want to promote one of them you have great ones and you have terrible ones but this is another solution uh to avoid to change completely your EIP system and to be a bit more agile the third one is to use Python and others so python is not really a tool it's a language or it's a programming language but it's very useful uh to generate forecast and analyze forecast so I really uh I have to talk about this one because it's getting very very popular in data science uh this is clearly very efficient if you have a lot of data and you can upload directly different models we're going to give you a full demonstration and how it works and if you want to go further and use it yourself we're going to give you and provide the right resource that you can learn by yourself but clearly we're not going to teach you in a few weeks how to uh code pythons from scratch so the idea is really to understand the power of it and you can do the same you can extract the data you can clean forecast and and send back the data to your IP system for example and the number four is to use Excel so you know Excel same principle you can do a lot of things with Excel consolidate clean forecast visualize analyze or you can also use it as um like my friend Mario from Amazon use Excel to analyze and then you will improve the system directly for example for Amazon so that's that's a tool we're going to use a lot because it's very intuitive it's very uh so it's very good for for Learning and and for the pedagogy and at the end you will have to choose not on the short term on the long run okay what tool do you want to use and you have multiple question this is um I would call a decision matrice where we can Pate what is the most important for you and you can see we have the tools you have the time to implement of course Excel is much faster you can use Simplicity flexibility if you can override the forecast or not uh this is something pretty bad in most of the Erp today how to change the forecast the simulation I like Python and Excel because they're really fast you want to change the parameter what is the global impact on that how to manage Big Data clearly if you are on NP you have a better integration because everything is in the same place but the cost to change or update these tools is much much more expensive so at the end I just wanted to focus on that we have four weeks where we want to focus on the time to implement and the cost and you don't have to ask permission to your IT director to install a new fusing software but at the end you can start like this we're going to start together you can explore with python and then you can Implement your improvement into your Erp system to improve the situation or the automation okay so let's go step by step we're going to practice a lot I'm very excited to share the new tools and the the methods we use and it will make much more sense for you whatever you work in Excel today or you already work with different forecasting system so you must have Excel to follow my course and we're going to use the latest version of it on Windows it's compatible with most of the latest version I will recommend at least to have the 200 161 why because we have more features and we also have power query by default which is very useful to clean uh data and we have also forecasting formulas which are uh very powerful and we're going to use if you have 2013 or 10 I would recommend you can still learn 95% of the method but I recommend maybe to pay for month it's only like $10 per month or something uh just to be on the latest version and definitely we are not providing any support or training with open Office and you can also use Excel MacBook but I would recommend if you have a Macbook that maybe like like me because I have a Macbook and a PC you can install Windows on Mac for free with apple boot comp or if you pay only a few dollars per month you can have a virtual machine so I recommend if you can to be on Windows but Mac is okay as well and at the end I can tell you we have big changes ahead with python moving into Excel uh we're going to give you a full demo uh during this course I'm very excited about it this is a free update for all the m and we can also have much more AI assistant such as co-pilot this is like the CH GPT of Microsoft that will help you to become more and more and more efficient with all these tools so I'm very exciting now let's go back into the process of forecasting and I hope you have more clarity about what is the best system for you whatever is the system you're going to learn and you're going to raise the skill and how to forus better and more accurately
all right my friends so the first step in the forecasting Excellence process is to Define your goals if you're not clear about what you want to reach you're not going to reach them right so that's what we're going to do and the first question why do we need a forecast do we always need a forecast that's a very good question and the focus is everywhere whatever you have a business of retail distribution manufacturing transport you do have Fus everywhere wherever you sell a service a product it's from the Upstream flow to the down Stream flow and you can also create many many forecasts that you will never really use so the real question is why do we forecast and what is the application behind the forecast whatever you work in finance in logistics you want to predict the behavior of your customers you want to produce croissant you want to adapt uh the team the the size of your team to make sure you have the right resource at the right time at the end the goal for me the the the the summary of what is the goal is to predict the future to allocate the right resources in terms of time in terms of people you want to allocate for example for a warehouse or a factory in term of money and investment that you want to invest to have the right investment for example in advertisement or to buy new products inventory and also to have the right communication at the right time and the idea is really to allocate the resource to become as efficient as possible to don't lose time with like reactivity but to be more proactive and also to have less stress in your life because if you don't know what's going to happen tomorrow it can be very very stressful right so the main challenge with the forecast is to face uncertainty right we live in a very uncertain world and if you join my my latest webinar we were talking about it there is a lot of things happening on the world it looks like everything is going faster and faster and it's becoming more difficult to predict what's going to happen in the future right between the the inflation interest rate the AI killing the jobs or maybe not creating jobs as well the trade Wars between different countries the evolution of the price we can see much much more volatility than before and if you take the example of the the car sales in the US over the last 10 years they had only 15% variation for seven years and after the pandemic it looks like we have now a big roller coaster so the challenge is to face this uncertainty and to become more resilient and focus where you have an impact and the conclusion of this first episode and I'm going to get back to this many times is what can you impact can you change the level of uncertainty in the world probably not I wish you can but I don't think you can or the level of your industry now if you the CEO of the company maybe you can impact your company but not fully I met many CEO from billion dollar company and they don't have so much power so the IDE is really like with this course what can you impact around you in your team immediately to improve the performance and let's stop focusing and wasting our energy on something that we cannot impact for the professional life but also for the personal life I see many people complaining about things that they cannot really change so yes you can complain if you feel good about it and French people were very good to complain but at the end I think I was um I did great progress and I think I'm a quite positive person because I only want to I only try to fix what I can impact and change not complaining about things that cannot I cannot have any impact on these planets of course you can always get information but don't get too contaminated by that okay so that's the conclusion of the first episode and I see you for the next one
all right so before going into uh the forecast and the goals what is the real cost of your inaccurate forecast today I really want to go back and amplify what's happening for you maybe you don't even have a forecast maybe you just surviving in a firefighting mode and at the end whatever you have a poor Focus accuracy or not the cost can be very expensive for your performance in terms of time you're going to lose a lot of time if you always react to problems and you don't anticipate them and the focus is used to anticipate the problem and allocate the right resource at the right time in terms of cash cash for your company profit if you don't know how to allocate the right resource you will probably lose sales for example you're going to lose profits you're going to maybe buy too much inventory at the wrong time like this pill of inventory and then you will have to do promotion so you're going to lose a lot of money your your sholders as well your as a as an employee if you have a career you may lose time in your career uh don't fast track your career because you're not good enough and clearly between a good demand planner and demand planner with a poor forecast accuracy as a manager I was promoting and giving more money and promotion and opportunity for the top performer also for the stress level the time and the stress are very related I received so much stress in my life because of poor Focus accuracy and poor execution and also for the planet just to give you one example when I was a su director or in a Cosmetic Company in Australia we had to do some air fright shipping because the forecast was really bad we had a lack of synchronicity of adjustment between Marketing sales and production and at the end went to chip by plan pallets and pallets of products with a lot of cash spent just for the the F rate the level of stress because it was very very last minute it was also very expensive for the margin and it was terrible for the planet because we were shipping products by plane so this is just one example but the domino effect can be really bad uh for yourself for your company and for your performance and the goal of this course is really to give you the tools and methods and actions that you can improve the situation
all right so now let's talk about the three level of forecast what are the three levels Ed so we talk about when you talk about forecast we have to be very specific we talk about location product and time when we talk about location is it is it a wall forast for the whole entire company is it only for one country for one region from one site could be one store one Factory could be one team or it could be one person okay so the location is something very important and you don't have the same complexity and the same goals whatever you only forecast for one person and for the global company for apple or for I Will Survive company then you do have the product the product start from the item item and model so what's the difference item for example you have this shirt or you have the shirt for the bicycle company I Will Survive uh you have the size for example XXL the very large size and then the model is all the size right the yellow shirt with all the size then the family will be the summer shirt family for riding and the category will be the closing category and the brand will be I will survive brand okay so that's different level of product and then you have different level of what we got temporality or time from hours minutes and seconds to days to weeks to months to quarter to years and when we talk about forast we say oh I need a forecast what is my goal you have to be very specific what is the location what is the product level and what is the temporality what is the time that you are expecting why I'm talking about that because after that we're going to meet the board of director and we're going to ask them okay but what do you really need which level of aggregation do you need to forecast and that's why I wanted to introduce that from the very macro strategic to the very operational we need both of them and we're going to talk in the next chapter do we is it better to focus top down or but botom up uh is it better to have Micro forecast or to have a sum of micro forecast uh we're going to talk about it very soon
so now my friend let's talk about the forecast Horizon what is the forecast Horizon you need maybe a forecast per product for uh a very specific uh location like a warehouse which is okay do I need the next week forecast the next months the next six months the next 24 months you need to be very specific and that's what we call the Horizon and you have probably have lead time with different like suppliers or customers and it's very important to know what is the minimum and what is the maximum they need for example if you're in a store you don't really need to have a very long forecast you don't need to know the forecast for the next 12 months you just need to to have the short one for the replenishment you don't maybe even need a forecast for that I've been working with a lot of company and they were asking for item forecast per store and then like 2,000 stores and they say yeah we need the 12 months forecast for everything but it was unnecessary it was just by just implementing a minmax replenishment because they were supplying the store every single day even twice a day it was completely unnecessary to have a forecast for that so you have to be very careful with the Horizon and also do you really need the forecast what is the application behind your forecast but of course if you have a factory the factory you cannot send an order and get or forecast and get the product tomorrow they have a minimum of production they have a lead time they have to buy components that's why you have to be specific okay for example for the factory we're going to talk about it with Jack machine the manufacturing director just after I need a forecast from 3 months to 12 months for example but before 3 months I cannot change anything it's already too late okay so I really wanted to introduce that and you will have to ask to everyone around you what is your forast horizon
okay so now the first action for your forecasting journey is really to define the goals with your teams and it can be a bit messy between marketing production products sales Finance Big Bus Supply Chain everyone had a different number and that's why I wanted to introduce you the different level The Horizon we have to be very clear what do we need and you have to do it by yourself there is a lot of stress because we are not on the same page we don't need the same thing at the same time with the same level of GR it and forecasting is not only about the best formula if you're on the same page of what do we need when and we are all aligned with the same the same goals you won't go anywhere and I think one of my superpower as a forecaster and as a a professional was the fact that I was really good to facilitate and to communicate and to make the fusing process easier and smoother in the company because you can see this phase everyone is stressed but that the end we all have the same goal we want to reach our goals we want to have a an happy and comfortable way to work and we want to impact our customers right so that's what you're going to do and what I recommend to do is this kind of table it doesn't matter if you are you have a small job as a demon planner it's not small it's important but if you have a job as a demon planner or if you already a director I feel like everyone should take the time to meet all the department maybe not the CFO of a billion company if you are if you just started in your company but I recommend to meet at least 1% of every department and having this process to say hey I'm going to meet the CEO I'm or one of the boss I'm going to meet Finance sales marketing and I'm going to ask them what do you really need which level by product by Time by quantity or value what is your Horizon and try to assess don't say that but try to assess also the forecasting level and I'm going to go back to all the cliche just after so I really encourage you to really do that and I think one of my superpower was not the mathematics it was the fact that I was connecting everyone and I was able to really understand the expectations the goals and the stress and the politics to be able to align everyone on the same page but you should do it first by yourself and we're going to meet everyone to make sure that we are clear of what everyone needs and want to improve the forecasting process
hey nice to see you again so as you know I am the CEO of the company my main focus is achieving the results and expectations of my shareholders we are expected to grow every year but we haven't for the last 3 years I don't really care about the details but it looks like there is a massive gap between the macro Finance forecast and the supply chain forecast per product I only work with Finance for annual budget I would be very curious to know what is the gap between what we plan and what we order per product to see if we have enough inventory to reach our ambitious targets I don't really care about the monthly forecast or the forecast per product what is important for me is the total forecast until the end of this year um I need to know if we are on track or not and what is the main Gap to reach our goals so please give us more clarity if I don't reach my objectives again my shareholders won't be happy and my position will be at risk all right so you already met the CEO of the company at the beginning and I can tell you the situation was quite stressful uh is as a CEO and I met a lot of CEOs from very billions comp big companies and small ones and I can tell you maybe maybe you think oh they have an easy life they're making a lot of money they're traveling a lot but at the end they have a lot of pressure they have pressure of results from their sholders because most of the time they have sholders if it's not the family is like like investment funds or even worse the stock market and the stock market is very very stressful I was in this company before or you also have the pressure from the team from the employees because they want to have resources they want to grow they want to have promotions and and bonus and you need to find the right balance and as a CEO you absorb a lot of stress a lot of pressure and that's what he's feeling with with GL Armstrong he has a lot of pressure to give visibility and also he kind of lost because you can feel that there is no raction and there is a massive gap between different different department but he doesn't know where to start or he doesn't want to go into details he wants to rely on a strong team and you are no part of the team and you need to support that and I think what I was good is I was good to connect and to give Clarity to a CEO the role of the co is not to forus most of the time you has a good intuition but the role of the CEO is to trust and rely on people like me and like you so try to connect with the CO as fast as possible in terms of fusing so it's going to be Global product Global doesn't care about details unless maybe for new products to see if there is new trends it's all about value and the focus is what I'm if I'm going to reach my target this year that's the main focus of the CEO and only by October November is going to think about the next year forecast his forecasting skills is not very high because he doesn't have the time for that unless he's coming from Finance uh but that's the the thing I can tell you about the CEO so please help him to save the company
Hello nice to see our forecasting expert again so as I told you during our team meeting I am the Chief Financial Officer of this company I am responsible for the financial forecast for the year I'm here to allocate the right pet and the right resources in terms of people Investments and cash to buy products my role is to make sure we are the most accurate as possible and also that we meet our shareholders expectations every year I work with my CEO to make sure we are on track and we are on the same page and to be honest I am really trust the forecasts coming from demand Fanning marketing and sales they look completely inaccurate and I don't really care about the micro forecast I only care about the micro in value and margin but it looks like they don't have any process so I don't trust them and I do my own forast on my side so what I'm expecting from you is to help me have a better visibility between my macro forecast and the micro forecast from the demand planning reduce the Gap and make sure we are on the same page between futs sales marketing product Logistics production and also Human Resources we are a huge roller coaster the cash flow is running out and I want to make sure that we are all on the same page to reach our ambition goals as well I'm sure it will be a walk in the park for a forecasting expert like yourself all right so you just met the CFO of this company you can see the stress and the tension so I met a lot of CFO I was always very close to finance maybe you work in finance and it's good to have you to uh to help you to improve the focusing process usually they're really good with numbers they have the they are the people who really like they are the serious people about numbers and when they have to take radical decision they take it I will go into cliche but they only trust numbers yes they understand marketing but at the end they only trust the results so we have to be very specific with CFO if it's not in the balance sheet it doesn't exist I had this uh this sentence many times in my life and as I was working in supply chain and operations I was always very connecting to them because they have the power they have the power to decide to allocate budget and they also have a lot of visibility and a lot of skills to help you at the macro level uh to provide you the right forecast sometimes they don't really trust every any anyone in the company so they do their own forecast uh because they feel like yeah the people are not good enough with numbers so they do their own thing that's a problem I see in many companies you have the finance alone and they don't really communicate with sales and and marketing uh that's a cliche but I had this situation a few times in my life at the end what do they want we're going to go back and we're going to start with them in the next in the few in the few chapters they want a micro forecast Global and also per category why because they also forecast the margin and the margin will be necessary per category so if you have a very profitable category uh that is growing more is going to impact the global margin so they like to have the macro and mid macro level uh most of the time monthly and annual in dollar in dollar for the sales and for the margin and the Horizon is going to be per quarter and for the next 12 months so that's it for the CFO and we'll go for the next one just after
hey how's it going forecasting expert I will just go straight to the point I'm the sales director of this company and my job is to sell and meet my customers not to do forecasts and I can tell you I'm very frustrated because I didn't get any bonus during the last two years because we never have enough inventory and we always spend way too much time with forecasting Gap meeting and Building Systems um what I should really be doing is is pushing and promoting our company with all my customers it's a very challenging job for me because I'm traveling a lot and I I have a lot of pressure with my biggest customers such as Walmart or Amazon and I cannot provide you a 12- month uh forecast in advance per product this is is impossible a we have very very short-term notice from our customers and I only know the promotion most of the time three months in advance not 12 months in advance my job is to sell more and to have a big bonus for myself and for the company um I don't really care about profit or inventory level and it looks like people in supply chain and even production are incapable to do their jobs so please help me give me the right tools the clarity and make sure we always take into consideration the promotions and the new information I bring to you at least from U one to six months in advance I'm counting on you to solve this situation all right so you just met the says director Leonardo Wolf The Wolf of Wall Street and yeah he doesn't care about anything other than the bonus that's a cliche of course but most of the time time the sales director they are very good sellers they have a strong ego and they want to be the best they want to be the top performer and win all the time and make their bonus that's a cliche but at then we need these people because if there is no sales there is no sales at all so you have to understand that their goal is not to spend the time behind the Excel spreadsheet they have to meet the clients and the customer and that's why at the end they really focus per client They Don't Really necessarily focus on the global level unless for the big bonus uh they focus per category most of the time not per product unless you have new new launch the time is most of the time per month and they focus in dollar sometimes quantity if it's about um launching or having new clients in your portfolio The Horizon is pretty shortterm I would get one to six months because they don't have much visibility from their customers after that but for their bonus they also Focus until the end of the year so they is from 1 months to 12 months most of the time they're not really good with forecasting and most of the time they have too much power on the forecast because they want to make sure they have enough inventory so they tend to over amplify their forecast and blame you if you don't have enough uh inventory for example but at the end I'm doing a lot of cliche but I think it's important to relate that these people are very important to the success of a company and you need to provide them the tools and method that they don't spend too much time on systems and more time to uh meet their customers
hey please make yourself comfortable I am the marketing director of this company and what I want to do is marketing not forecasting and wasting my time with this stupid Erp or Excel spreadsheet I don't even know how to use Excel and between the two of us I'm very tired about it my main goal is to create and launch amazing products and promote per Distributors the quality of our products but I spend way too much time with the sales team the product team and the demand planning team to talk about forecasts so please help us I want to spend the minimum time as possible on that and yes I want to launch a new amazing clothing collection the next season and I'm very excited about it but I cannot provide you 24-month forecasts in advance this is not my job to do that so tell me what's the minimum I need to give you teach me how to improve our launch forecasts and take care of the rest and I will take care of the creativity to make sure this company grows super fast so you just met the marketing director she L creativity as you can see and she like I'm going to go to cliche again but they really don't like Excel numbers it's all about creation and and really transforming the The Branding and the image of your product and of your company so I spend quite a lot of time with people for marketing and you have to help them a lot if you give them too much power on the forecasting it's going to be a challenge because they don't have time for that they're not very comfortable with system especially with Excel so at the end they need usually the focus per distribution Canal for example if you have a Distribution Company is going to be or e-commerce we do an ads on e-commerce or retail or whatever if you in manufacturing it's a bit different for the product level it's going to be subcategory and product especially for new launch or even promotions uh and for the timing is going to be a per week or per month uh most of the time they have a planning per week but we we try to consolidate uh to have at the end a monthly forecast they really focus on dollars uh and do because they have most of the time they have a percentage of marketing based on the sales in value that's why sometimes they tend to over over forast amplify the forecast to have more budget in marketing that's a cliche and the Horizon is 1 to six months pretty shortterm I that the big problem with marketing because they wanted to do stuff immediately but the execution in the supply chain production and Manufacturing was from 3 to 12 months so we had a lot of tension around that and you have to be very clear what is possible and what is not possible uh to make sure that there is no fight between Department
hey nice to see you again forecasting expert to introduce myself I am the product director of this company and my job is to reshape the industry to create the most Innovative products that will transform the way our customers use and travel and commute to work that is my job not working on forecasts all day I have a lot of frustration because we had very poor new product launch the last few years we were always late in the production and Logistics and never aligned with marketing and at the end I cannot really provide you a micro forecast my new products are very different and not always comparable I will do my best to give you a new product forecast but I will need your help to train me and teach me how to forecast new products then we can have a better alignment between all the Departments and I hope bring back some clarity into this company sometimes I think we need to be a little more down to earth and not with our heads up in Mars all right so you just made the famous Elon m the product director he wants to reshape the industry with a new flying bike and these people they really have focusing on product obviously uh it's a global location uh it's per month or even per year and they really focus on quantity unless they have a bonus on the the value of the product they sell the Horizon is 6 to 24 months because they need a lot of time for planification between manufacturing between Logistics between marketing most of the time they have a very good knowledge of the market because they need to understand what really people want I'm not sure they want Flying bike but it looks really cool so in many companies the Project Director or manager is the one responsible for the first forecast with a big Market study but then most of the time they're not really good for the Baseline forecast when you have an ongoing product so we're going to talk about it when we're going to launch new products with Elon MK and I see you for the next episode
hey be careful I don't want our forecasting expert getting hurt with a pilot so as you know I am a logistics director and my job is to supply my customers on time and I can tell you it was a nightmare the last few years we had so much volatility we had no visibility and we had to recruit people last minute and then fire these poor people only because we had no visibility so what do we need for C quantity we have to supply the logistic sectors we need short-term visibility and quantity for my team not per product but per logistic sector we need a midterm visibility for the capacity and make sure we have enough space and people to recruit and also we need a long-term visibility for expansions if we need to open a new Warehouse or not but the most important is to provide us a stable forecast that doesn't change by 20% every week so please help me I don't care about sales and marketing just give me a quantity we have to supply and we do a job you just met the logistic director Jeff amaz us he's amazing and he's not supply chain director why I don't want to put supply chain uh in this uh in this story uh because supply chain can be nowhere and everywhere and I really want to focus on very like specific Department to see what they need or not but for me you could be part of supply chain you could be part of product Finance you are a forecasting expert and whatever you are you're going to improve the forecast accuracy so what Logistics need they need quantity or they also need per type of products what we call Logistics sectors of category could be like voluminous products small products ethero products dangerous products because they need to plan and in the warehouse you have different sectors and per sector is a very different way to work so they need in quantity they need a very short term for the picking and the and the packing and the Expedition then in the weekly for the workforce to to see if they need contractors for example and they need the monthly annual from one to 24 months if they also planning to expand the network so I was working on the logistic expansion Network for few companies and I can tell you you need a lot of data and numbers and quantity and that's why one of your role will be to feed the forecast to Logistics because most of the time they're not really connected to sales and marketing they they tend to use their forecast from last year okay last year I did the x million quantities plus 5% but they don't really see what's happening from the market so it's very important to really integrate the logistics and give them the visibility especially when you have big change versus last year
Hello nice to see you again I'm the production and Manufacturing director and I'm very tired of always having so many changes and volatility with the forecast we produce in China we have a very long lead time we need a forecast per product but also per components then we can buy the products and have the right capacity for the production in advance and guarantee the right price and the right quality at the right time so what do I need long-term visib ability stable forecast 12 months in advance I don't understand why there are so many changes every month so please help give us more clarity and I will produce amazing products for everyone I really feel like you are the right person for this Mission thank you for your help you just met the production director the manufacturing director Jack machine what he cares is about making the best product with the best quality but for that you need to give him visibility visibility and stability and they complain a lot and I've been working with a lot of manufacturing suppliers and companies of variation one week to another you have 20% variation in your forecast you cannot work this way in the in a factory and what they focus is quantity per production line because you have different machines and different people and different factories for that so we need to give them product forecast but also component forecast which is the link between what we call the bill of material between okay you have a bike how many components do we need to produce and buy behind you have a very shortterm notice uh they have to do they have to do their own manufacturing production but we're going to focus more on the the production the what you're going to buy to the factory from 3 to 24 months uh because if you have a long lead time you cannot produce anything for tomorrow and they also need visibility to expand their manufacturing capacity if necessary for the next few years
as I explained in the previous meeting I am the Human Resources Director and what I really care about is the people in this company and I can tell you the last few years were a big roller coaster for us with a lot of stress and tensions we had to recruit then fire so many people and it was a very sad and intense moment for me and for all the company so I don't really know about forecasting or Excel I don't even know how to use vlookup but I need to know from you what are the most accurate forecasts at a global level but also o per site especially for logistics for the company and also for the production to make sure that we'd plan six months in advance if possible the right recruitment because we need also time to train these people so please give me visibility and I can recruit the most amazing people to help this company to grow and also have more peace and serenity in the teams thank you for your help you just met Michelle bakare she really care about people as you can see clearly AI is not really part of the fusing process but they really need the forus to allocate the right people with the right training and also having stability and serenity in your company so don't forget about ETA to give them visibility most of the time they're going to use the forecast from Finance to plan how many people do we want and they will connect with every single director and I was very close to my HR to see okay how many people we need in Logistics in my warehouse in my demand planning team I was also responsible for the customer service and the more you sell quantity the more you need people to reply to the phone on email and so yeah don't forget about HR most of the time it's per quarter globally it's in a value and then they have a budget with finance and then you can allocate the right resource but clearly they're not responsible to focus for you
hey nice to see you again so I am the AT director of this company and everyone is complaining about it but no one really understands the complexity also no one is creating any tickets to report any problems I know that no one trusts my Erp which is very old it was installed 10 years ago and it's very expensive and difficult to change anything everything is connected and if we change one thing everything can collapse my first job is to guarantee the stability of our system before doing any changes also I can see that because no one trusts system they're all creating their systems in Excel and everyone is using different spreadsheets and I cannot provide any support on that because my job is to make sure we have everything in the system not outside if you want to change anything in my Erp you'll have to create a project and the minimum time to start implementing is 6 to 12 months we have a plan to change our Erp but it's going to take 2 to 5 years I'm still working on that so please help us on the short term to clarify the process make sure we use as little Excel as possible or at least one unique template for the whole company I also recommend you to connect your data with my system I heard about power query to connect and clean the data you should have a look and we can then teach everyone in the company thank you for helping us out I hope it's not too late to bring back some peace into this company you just met the IT director maruk book I'm going into a cliche again but many people complain about it and I can tell you there is a part of yes we should but also this is not easy to be an N director why because the first goal of it is to guarantee a stability of your system and I've been in companies where we could not invoice clients anymore and it was a disaster and why because we were doing too many Chang in the system and we we lost control so you have to understand that the goal of it is not to give you a new feature every day it's first stability and then to provide you the right Innovation if it's a right integration with their system of course my main with this course is to have very quick result so I'm not going to tell you to change your Erp tomorrow we're going to talk about it in the how to prepare the future but you won't do anything without it so you need to be very clear what you need you need it to access to the data and I was always very close very respectful and I was also including it people in my board of directors in my project boards and also always thank be thanksful for these people because without the system you can't do anything but yes they don't like Excel because they they cannot really control Excel but at the end you will have to find the right balance between what you can do today and what you can do with the system in the long term
all right congratulations so you met everyone and now you have this summary tab of what do we want what do we need and we need very what you can see we need very different forecast based on the department and what they're looking for with different quantity or dollars time product location Horizons and the idea at the end is really to consolidate and say okay what are we going to do at the end many Department need a global forecast to alloc allocate the right resource but we also need a product forecast in quantity and value uh to plan the activity for logistics for production for new products so we will have to find the balance between the micro forecast and the macro forecast we're going to start with the micro and finance uh just after but it's important to also understand that you you need all of it I didn't mention but there is a demand planning demand planning tab you could call it forecasting at the end demand planning can be a like I was a demand planner manager uh for me it's not a department it was part of the supply Cham but sometime it's not sometime can be part of production if you have a man manufacturing company or Logistics or Finance at the end my goal is really to consolidate and to focus on the macro and mro and we're going to do it from 1 to 12 months or even 24 months uh I like to have a forecaster who is really focusing on that and at the end whatever is your responsibility I really recommend to have another meeting with all these people you met and show them okay this is what you need guys and just by doing that you will start releasing the tension to say hey we don't really need the same thing that's why we are so much in conflict of course maybe don't show this one about the fusing skills because they won't like that but at the end it's very important that you you create this cision between all the department to say first let's get on the same page what do we want and then let's work together to improve all the the situation of the forecast accuracy so do that I've been doing that in every single job I was staring in my comp in my different companies or as a consultant and it's a very good way to start connecting everyone and also becoming more visible and I became very visible very fast and that's why also my car my career went really fast uh in my different companies
so we could see before we have many different forast from micr product forecast to micro forast but who HS the forast who is responsible we're going to start with my friend Mario to see what Amazon is doing all right so now the question at Amazon who Huns the Fus who is responsible for the forast Mario tell me yes uh now it's the account manager so it's basically someone who's uh very knowledgeable about the markets and the products and so by default we have what is called assist forecast something generated by the machine automatically using mathematical formulas and stuff like this machine learning algorithms and then if uh the person uh judges that there is uh he has a better better knowledge about what the forecast is going to be yeah he can he can change it he can override it okay okay but do you think he's do you think he's capable of doing that because he he doesn't have any forecasting skills or because they're coming mostly the they key account manag so they're really connected to sales right and from my experience sales people tend to always amplify their reality because they want to make their bonus what do you think about that yeah so when when we speak about ownership we also speak about accountability so these people are accountable for the overrides they do uh they are monitored and um if the performance is not is not good they basically they they they will be they will be remove their rights or reduce their possibility of Performing uh uh more overrides in the future so yeah so that's why they're they're the they they objective is also to be accurate it's something they have to bear in mind and uh they know also roughly how accurate is the machine so they have to judge when to make the override and when not to make the override and they have a bonus you know for accuracy you think no no they don't have a bonus for accuracy so we just you just stop they just lose access if they're not good enough yes and it's very painful because because U you know on they might be some important products where you really need to make an override and if you don't have rights anymore okay your entire business is going to is going to is going to uh is going to is going to take the is going to take the the hit and and then and then and then your bonus as well because your bonus is best index on on on the overall business that's why you don't want to you don't want to do crazy overrides you don't want to do things about you're not very sure you only overrides the things you're really really sure about nice and there is a big yeah a big uh uh entitlement and uh so there is no demand planner at Amazon because most of for most of the company clearly they don't have your system and I think the beauty of your system is yes you have a machine you give access to the right people who knows the market but if they're not good enough you remove some uh freedom on on this machine and clearly 99.9% of you you don't have this system today and the question is for most of the company I feel it should be what we call the demand planner if you have if you have a supply chain where is the supply the demand planner in Amazon yeah Amazon is pretty peculiar they were demand planning before um they were kind of removed that at at least in in in the in in the shape and form of demand planner and then this demand planning task has been assigned to the account manager uh one of the reason maybe Amazon is all is very peculiar is that you know they have hundred of millions of products yeah so it's very difficult for just a few people to know everything about about all the markets all the products it's much better for the account manag are many many more account managers so it's it's a yeah it's it's it's a better it's a better decision overall okay and yes okay so that's uh that's a big change for many company because they're clearly not ready for that and that's what we're going to see during the this course is how can we integrate the the the knowledge from the from the field from the sales from marketing or for the maybe the the product manager if you have a manufacturing company uh but also using a system to make sure that we don't have any crazy forecast coming from humans because sometimes we we tend to amplify or over react if we are if we are if we are stress or if we don't have enough time just to analyze the data so the conclusion again is the person who knows better the market and the product but make sure you have the right system and the right Safeguard around all right so we had a good chat with Mario and I hope you had a good insight for him at the end it's a very uh sensitive topic who is responsible for the forecast for me at the end is the conclusion we are talking about the person who knows better the market and the product but remember this is we have very different people and we have very different uh goals so be very careful who you give the responsibility because if the person don't really care about the shortterm and you give them the responsibility for shortterm forecast it won't be the their priority okay so at the end for me who on the forast my conclusion as well this is not there is not a clear answer it really depend the way your company work and what is the compan doing and the different department but for me you should have a responsible forecasting expert with the full ownership and people responsible to feed the forecast whatever they are and people that will review the forecast who improve the forecast okay for example you can have a system like Amazon that will create a baseline forecast and then sales and marketing will be only responsible to provide you the new product launch and the promotion effect and most of the time the responsibility is not clear no one is responsible and everyone is responsible for me when you're in this situation you need what we call facilitator and I was a facilitator I was an snop manager and when I was a demand planner I was also facilitating all the meetings and all the the information I will Gathering to feed the forecast and also to improve and analyze uh the forecast so that was my that was my goal and the goal of this course is not only about the mathematics once again it's about to create a cohesion and the collaboration between all the department and I'm sure you can do it as well whatever you are a junior in your company or you're already a manager but you have to keep this in mind that you must have single accountability and ownership make it 100% clear in your goals early in the year if it's not clear with your manager ask for clarity and then of course if you give all the responsibility to sales and you don't track the accuracy you will never know so if you feel that there is the wrong person with the responsibility check the accuracy and show that this is not efficient and then maybe you have to change who will own the the ownership of the forecast for example at the end for me I had the power to say you know what sales I'm going to reduce all your forus by 30% because you are always uh over over amplifying the quantities so I had I had the power as well not only the responsibility but the power to change the forecast from sales because they were not accurate enough
So after talking about responsibilities now what is the right level of focus accuracy we need to define a Target right and the first thing before defending targets do you ever track your accuracy first do you have a forecast we're going to get back to this and then do you even track your accuracy so we're going to go back to this in the next chapters or to track your accuracy Global level and micro level uh there is different methods we're going to go back to what we call the BS which is more like a global um Global way to see if you are over fusing or you you tend to have your quantity and values less than your your reality and you have the what we call the M Mae the mean absolute error or you can also call it m a mean absolute deviation I'm going to get back with a lot of example in Excel no pressure but you need to track your accuracy if you want to Define goals at the end this is just one example it's very difficult to give you a number because we all have very different way to calculate we have different level of uncertainty we have different forast Horizon do you forast for do you take your forecast from last week last months two months ago three months ago you focus per week per month how many products Amazon 100 million products maybe you have 50 products so this is what is important for me at the end is you need to track and you need to improve yourself it's much easier to compare your past performance than the one from another company or or another industry okay so the right level of focus accuracy when as to Amazon and Mario is going to be 100% that's their goal but they know it's mathematically impossible unless you only lock your orders when you have the confirmation from your clients and you make two order basically uh but the goal is really to improve whatever is your level of uncertainty you have product with more uncertainty such as umbrellas which are not easy to predict every day and you have the French baguette with the same quantity of baguette and croissant every day so it's very stable so you must have a better accuracy on these products than these products right but at the end whatever is your level of uncertainty you have to improve it you can improve it and the goal is more about you can always improve then I need to have for example 70% of accuracy Benchmark for me doesn't make any sense uh also very important the lead time if you have a very very shortterm lead time it will be much easier to predict than if you have you want to forecast in one or two years in advance the more youly time the more you will amplify the level of inaccuracy and the cty so you have to be aware of it and once again you can compare with the same lead time from versus last year what is your improvement if I go back to my team as well there was my team in Brazil uh in supply chain and and product and at the end in my team had very different levels of accuracy uh from the best one the junior one and the the the most top performer one and the goal as a manager as well is okay what is your average goal for example I want to go to 70% maybe but the real goal also is to reduce the gap between everyone and to reduce the Gap we're going to go back to this you can improve new methods processes training Automation and that's why also we are not only training individual but entire team because if you can raise the level of everyone and reduce the Gap it will be much easier for everyone for your team and for the performance of your company so track not only the average but the Gap and make sure that everyone is going uh to the the way of continuous Improvement so at the end there is always room for improvement but it will never be good enough I can tell you I think I was a top performer high potential in most of my companies but my my boss were always saying edar you can do better Ed you can do better be careful with that it will never be good enough so if you're a perfectionist like me and I I tend to be very competitive with my performance too much uh and I want to ban out because I was too attached to super high performance I was thinking about it almost all the time even before going to bed and yes that's maybe because I'm U I learn very fast and I'm uh I'm here today to to show you that but be very careful because they had a very strong impact on my body so don't get any Obsession about this this is this is just numbers and this is not life take a step back and if you feel your stress about it maybe uh disconnect and go go to Nature to to relax so now we we talk about it we're going to I'm going to tell you how to become more efficient more uh to to give more clarity and visibility and that will also help you to take a step back and not be too stress about this topic of forecast
all right my friends so now the second step to fusing Excellence is to collect and transform data right but my data is inaccurate I've seen so many people told me oh it I can't do anything because I don't have the right data and I can tell you you don't need that much data so what kind of input data do I need to forecast when I was checking with my friend Mayo from Amazon even Amazon is not using they are using a lot of quantity because they have 100 millions of products but they don't need that many different data point uh to have a good forecast accuracy so what do I need uh if we check uh what do I need the first thing you need to have the the list of your product the skill list what are the product attributes for for example the category the typ the typology that permanent of the collection uh the title of the of the product the description and also the status is it a new product is it an active product or is it a discontinued product so this is really basic information and we're going to get back to this into to excel very quickly but this is important to have all this information and also multiple category then you can also do some seasonality or Trends thanks to the same group of products I'm going to get back to this into the seasonality topic then when you have the the product information uh of course you have different level even for micro forecast I recommend to have the micro details then you can consolidate and you can do a multiple analysis you really need to have uh the same or the consumptions in quantity of your business so if you have if you're a distributor you are you're going to sell product if you're a factory you're going to consume product I'm going to get back to this also it's good to have it in dollars maybe you want to do a financial forecast uh maybe you want to plan the revenue for the next two years so you need to have the quantity and the dollars and you were checking in the previous chapter that some Department only work with value and some others with quantity for for example Logistics or production then if possible but this is not mandatory it's good to have the service a avability with an E here just here the Demand versus the sales why because it's good to know for example you are selling 1 million products uh but you missed an opportunity to sell another 100,000 extra so it's good to have the balance between War because at the end you want to focus the demand and not the sales and sometimes you are missing a lot of sales because you don't have enough inventory so we could we could talk about avability rate or service rate I'm going to get back to this when we talk about how to calculate the level of your of your sales uh but this is good to have but if you don't have it it's okay you can still have a decent forecast with that and then it's good to have all the Promotional and advertising events in the past and in the future in the past to explain what happened in the past okay why did I grow by 50% the specific months and in the future to anticipate and UNR uh to add more value into to the the forecast so that this is also not mandatory we're going to get back to this with marketing and sales to see how we can get this information and also it's good to have some uh history of your data I recommend to have at least three to five years I recommend five years because we had some very turbulent years with the the post pandemic so the more you have history the more you will be able to see Trend seasonality and analyze what's happening in your business okay so that that was just a quick introduction you don't need that much data and much information to have an accurate forecast keep it simple and if you don't have everything it's okay just start with what you have today
all right so now let's talk about finished goods components raw materials volume weight you have probably multiple different business and industry and I've been working with like 30 different Industries and at the end the principle of fusing is the same but we use different units for example if I go back to a like a bicycle t-shirt between the raw material production in India to the factory we move from raw material to t-shirt to maybe box and pet in logistics to go back to UNI uh in your Distributors you will have different way uh to forus with different units it really depends the way you manage if for example only forus in tons or liters it's okay you just have to switch we're going to use a quantity unit in my specific example but at the end we're talking about time series and we just have to change the unit to forecast whatever you are on this business and supply chain if I go back to a factory you have suppliers you have the reception then you will probably have components and raw material then you will have the production and then you will have finished finished goods uh at the end of the factory so wherever you are on the on the supply chain or on the manufacturing process you may want to forecast uh the consumption of a components or directly at the sale or the the production of the Finish go to your clients it really depends where you are and the the information and data you have as as well in the process but there is no bad or wrong position to to have really depends what what is your responsibility as well today if you have a lot of information about the business it's better to forecast the finished goods but if you don't have much information when I was in Malaysia I had no idea and the lead time with the customer was very very long so I was only focusing on the consumption my data point was the consumption of the of the raw materials and I was running all my focusing model based on that and not on fish Goods because I no access to this data so you have to decide which one is the most accurate for you if you have both options maybe you can try both and see which one has the best accuracy we're going to see that later but at the end yeah if you have if you work with final products or components if you have a manufacturing business you have multiple way to focus starting from the finished goods on the sales forecast is the option one once again if you have access to the the market and you have the the closer you are from the market on your customer for me the easier it is and the less instable is the the consumption and also the quality of the focus uh then you have the consumption of the of the components or you could also have the consumption of your raw material so you have different level but at the end for example if I forast I'm going to sell 10 bikes of this finished goods it's going to be two uh 20 to two * 10 so um um 20 tires and rims and it's going to be much more like maybe um X kilo or grams of aluminium etc etc so we're going to I'm going to give you more example with Jack machine but at the end in my specific example we're going to focus on forecasting the finished good sales forecast and then spread this forecast into different level into the company
all right so before we start cleaning transforming the data I just wanted to say something very clear don't wait for Perfection and I can tell you even Amazon is on waiting for Perfection and this is for me an excuse not to move on you have to be in movement and the best way to improve your focus skills and accuracy is to try Implement and improve in know the process and I've seen so many members they are blocked and say no I can't have this specific price or promotion planning so I can do anything and yes you can do you can do and you you don't need that much data I was explaining before for example Amazon they tried to to include the the forecast of the weather in the forecast and it was very complex and it didn't provide a better accuracy because the system was too volatile I did the same for my projects and on the paper it looks smart but it doesn't work same for Amazon they were including the price uh the price of the product in the forecasting model and they were realizing that it was not that efficient if you come to my last webinar that was uh one of the explanation of mayo is like sometimes having more data you can see of course at the beginning will bring you more accuracy if you don't have the sales quantity or sales value maybe it won't work at all but if you try to add so too many data uh point that are not mandatory at one point you will increase the complexity and you may also have some very very poor results so for me the Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication and as was saying Jeff Vis us before start simple no and optimize later you should take your decision and act with 70% of your information and not 90% otherwise you are getting too slow
okay so now we're going to talk about how to extract data we have seven steps for that the first one you need to be very clear what do you need so that's why within the previous chapter you need to write down okay what do you need the objective the impact all the stakeholders and actors who will have uh the the responsibility to give you this data and I recommend to create a first model you say Okay into Excel this is what I want this is the colon one colon two colon three I want the side the category the subcategory the code the item name the date and the quantity be very specific because I've seen so many people they just an email say hey can you get give me the sales please but okay but what do you need exactly and when you talk with it you have to be very specific so after meeting everyone and the board of director I hope you enjoy it even if they were quite stressful what do we want we want at the end we want the macro and the micro some department needs the global forast and other want the micro so let's take the smallest level we want the product level at the global level so we are not going to provide the details per customer right now and this company is working monthly so we're going to have a monthly sales if your company work weekly uh if all the reporting are weekly you should switch to weekly it really depends or is your company and we're going to ask for quantity and dollars because Alpha V needs dollars and the rest quantity for the the Orizon in the past we're going to try to get more than 3 years we're going to get 5 years yes 5 years and in the future that's the forecast we're going to provide so we're going to get back to that after then we need to identify the key person who is this person who going to give me access to the data I really need this person can be very different depends on the size of your company it could be Marx ukuk the IT director it could be an engineer he could be a key user not necessarily an expert could be a consultant we have many companies now they have like they outsourc the IT department so you have a lot of Consultants only who have access h you need to find this person with a lot of experience with a lot of information in the head most of the time I can tell you I've been working a lot with it and uh most of the time I feel this department is not is not recognized enough and it's a very stressful position especially the the one at the front desk because they have so many demands everyone is has a lot of stress and frustration with system and it's not that simple to change the system as we were explaining before with Mar zuuk book so I recommend always to uh to build a long-term trust relationship don't always come to people in it when you want to complain when it's super super super urgent and I recommend also I'm going to get back to this to always highlight the person who help you on all your projects to make sure that also part of the of the the good side effect of your of your success okay so once once you find this person and there is always there is always a person if you don't find anyone just find the worst the less the least worst person who knows about the system and if you don't know anyone maybe it's time to look a consultant who will go deep dive into what's happening in your it system but for sure you need if you need only the sales at least Finance as the the information okay so then you need to identify where is the source and this person will tell you where is the data coming from so you have Erp WMS like for warehouse or TMS for transport you have the cloud much more company now I'm switching to the cloud and so it's getting much easier to get access to data it could be database it could be bi tools uh pobi as well sap business subject click view or it could be just files in your share folder Xcel txt access etc etc so you need to know where is the source and try to find the source of the source right if you have an Excel and maybe something into a a cloud try to get access directly to the cloud if you can then the number four you need to First do a manual extraction why don't try to make a project do it manually table by table uh for example with sap mrd this is just one example and do a data the verification and try to to make sure that what you ask from your Excel template is the same that what you you get from the system and what are the gaps that you can improve once you have this you can then standardize and automate your extraction so we could be creating a query directly into your into your ARP for example in sap or others we call that query like or you going to you're going to create like we we call a request to automate your extraction we're going to use power query very soon then you can do it automatically it's very simple you can create rules to maybe transform data you can ask for it development we can create like a batch like in one of my company every Monday a batch like a system in the in my I was just extracting my my data into a text file on my share folder every Monday morning I was very efficient and you can also access to what we call data L this is more advanced but this is a leg where all the data is available and then you can connect and have it so you have multiple tools for that I cannot teach you all of them but we're going to go back to Parker which is very accessible free if you have already Excel and I love it because it's uh it's super efficient then the number six once you have all this process and it's automated I recommend you to formalize the process mapping the data right on the process step by step because no one is doing that right maybe record a video I'm using a tool called Loom LOM you can check uh on Google train several people and Define clear responsibilities to make sure you are not the only one if you go on holidays and calling you back calling you back from the beach while you are surfing because they need to have access to your sales quantity and make this process accessible to all you don't want to be a the only one to know and control everything you want to be free to grow and maybe have a promotion then the number seven reward the key person especially in it I I was very um um happy to bring uh this people into my steering committee I thank him or her publicly by email or in my meeting thingss I like to give a restaurant on cant because I love cant and also send private email at the end of the year to the manager of the people that really helped me if I if I feel they were very important for my project because if you send a private note to your manager to say you know this this person from my will help me and you you bring the value and the quality of the person they can have salary increase and promotions and it's a win-win I win they win and they know they're winning with me and then you build a long-term relationship it's not politics for me is just giving and U sharing value and that's the way also I think I was quite popular in my company because I was not playing only by myself so do it and I see you for the next episode
in this episode my friend I want to introduce you po query and power pivot why because this is life changing especially if you if you have a problem with lot of data you want to consolidate you want to clean it took me so many years to realize how easy and efficient was this tool and whatever you work in an Erp system or in a forecasting software I think it's very important that you know uh the way it works so my quick introduction if you don't know this tool before so you have all your data then you want to get and transform this data we call that ETL extract transform and load and for that we're going to use Pro query to to do all of that to import to connect to merge to transform to clean and to do a lot of automations that you don't have to do contrl c contrl v etc etc for that there is a language called m the m language but you need to code anything this is a no code solution much much easier than macro and Visual Basic then if you want to go deeper you can do some Advanced calculation and modelization with po pivot uh with data model table links like a very Advanced kpi I'm not going to use uh the power pivot during this course because you don't need it basically you can do most of it with po query by just transforming the data and then we're going to use it uh for multiple ways so powerquery is is to get on transform power pivot is more advanced but you only need that in only a few minutes you can get the 2080 to 20% of the action that will bring you 80% of productivity and the last step is to analyze and take action with your data and for that you can use Excel or you can use a tool called pobi which is very similar you're going to use a lot of power C into PBI to uh display your information but for that you need specific license so we're going to stick into Excel for this example then you don't have to get approval from your it department so how do we see a powerquery into the Excel let's just create a new file Excel file let's call it do it with me you have to practice with me forecasting uh start two you'll be able to download this file but don't open it just do another one open this file and then where is Power query it's already so if you have at least the version 2016 it's part of Excel IF you have a 2013 version you will have to install um like an addin you can check on Google if you want to do that I recommend at least two of the 2016 version you can even do it with MacBook now so there is no excuse you go to data and then if you click on get data you can see this is for query you can create a connection with a file a text XML Jon even PDF from a folder for example you have one file per month or per week you can extract all of them automatically from a database you will need some access with your it Department from the the cloud from Microsoft Azure po Azure did I pronounce correctly Azure the from Power Platform from other source uh you have many many options you can even get from internet where is the internet uh we from the web exactly so this is what we're going to play we're going to I'm going to give you really the the the fundamentals then you can start using it and for my forecasting tool I'm using it because with do have a lot of data and you can manage thousand or even millions of rows and data point with this tool because it's much more efficient than just doing contrl C and control V in uh your Excel file so that's what we're going to do in the next episode
all right my friends so now we're going to start playing in Excel so for that you have to download this file we're going to have you have the data all the data we need you have the skillist the sales quantity the sales in val in value the price and the availability and we also have a data cleaning exercise that we're going to do together just after I'm not going to give you this file right now but just to give you an idea if I open it clock so we're going to create uh basically this file step by step uh from um we're going to check all this information but we're going to start with the skew list we're going to check the level the trend all the classification and uh we're going to also have a super cool dashboards to track the uh the performance the Gap the dashboard so stick with me this is just the beginning but the beginning is very important because we have to build the right foundation uh to be able to focus C and have the right data to do this so what we're going to do we have all this information the first step is to include the skq list so if you go to your data download all of this put it in a folder uh where you won't move your your files because we're going to create connection it's important to keep the same location of your file um we're going to start with the skew list so the skew list is the list of your product basically in this list what do you have you have the sites so for this specific one we only have one site but maybe you have three different location and you want to have three different forecast I recommend to keep it simple if you have three warehouse for example and and that will uh be suppli by a big one for example you have one warehouse and three um stores start by the for the focusing at the the biggest point of your supply chain okay so for example in my specific point we're going to forus from the big house and we're going to get all the sales from all the customers but if you have multiple one you could have also this option to have all three different files or one one colum that will say this is my specific file or it could be a specific forecaster or whatever then you have the item code you have the item name you have the category the subcategory and the item status so for the item code and name make sure it's in a number format then you can really connect with all the base or you keep you keep all of them in textt format when you extract from an sap for example or IP sometimes you have a a text format you can convert we can do it in power quy automatically or you can do a data text to colum and if you click next next and you press finish it it's going to convert the format of your text into number or you can do text if it's if you want to have a text format okay so I'm not going to do that because it's already number format then we have the name and then we have the category the category are very important why because uh you will have we will create seasonality and Trends and you will have information for marketing and sales as well and they're going to provide you um information based on the category of your product not only the product itself when we look at the category we have accessories BM mix the the bikes the closing electric bikes kids bikes mountain bike and road bikes okay so for example if I get to kids bikes or clothing up then we have sub category we have men summer closing men winter closing then women summer closing and woman winter closing right why is it important because between summer and winter you don't have the same seasonality so it's important to have as possible as much as possible homogeneous groups like you want to have product with the same behavior and also when you do for example a marketing plan or promotion they're all part of the same category so you could have two three four five categories it depends on the size of your business but at the end there is a lot of work behind this category this is not only the responsibility of the person doing the forecast but it's coming from the product Department marketing and sales and try to make it as homogeneous I was I say like as similar as possible from production to distribution sometimes we have a we have a manufacturing class and we have uh like a sales class uh but keep it as simple as possible and use the category where the the sales or the consumption are coming from in this case we use uh the one from the the distribution okay then we do have what we call the ATM status we have active and we have discontinued active the product is uh basically on the catalog is for sale discontinued you this product is not part of the current collection for example but we still have some inventory for example okay so how do we Define that you can use a start date and an end date and if the date of today is in between the start and the and the end this is an active product if this is before this is a discontinued product what we're going to add as well with marketing and the product team we're going to add new products the third category will be new products you don't have any sales in the past you don't have any inventory but you will have new products and we're going to include this forecast in to the global uh forecast as well so I recommend to have this category maybe you have a different name but what is very important in this product list make sure you have all the products active and also the discontin with maybe inventory and sales the last one or two years then you have an overview of all your products and all the behaviors and make sure so you include later or maybe right now the new products for your cat once you have that you can get it maybe from sap or from your EIP system PBI just contrl C and we do like this perfect so now you have all of this uh make sure maybe like you have a lot of products from coming from yourp from 10 years ago only use the one maybe with sales the last two or three or four years only with inventory for the active one and at least one of these two version or at least two years one quantity sold the last two years and and or inventory today because maybe you are out of stock so you're not selling anything but you were selling this produ over the last two years okay now when you have this something very important transform this into a table format so we're going to go to inser table my table as it yes and know we have something much Clear much clearer to to read right why I like this format because this is comfortable this is it looks nice and when you're going to ask okay I want to have a new product it will automatically create another row and you will also duplicate all the formula so this is much efficient also this is much better for uh pivot table after so make sure you do all of this with this specific format and when you're going to add new for example price is going to do it automatically so that's it for the skew list make sure you have all the products inside and in the next episode we're going to start connecting with more data
okay so now we're going to start using powerquery to add the price so we go back to the data set we do have the price great we have the price and what do I want I want this I'm going to do it manually and then we're going to use par query and you will understand the main difference let's copy this table I'm going to call this one base plus and I'm going to copy that okay cool I have the price and now I can do price equal V lookup that's the wrong way to do it but I just want to do it for you and you see when you have a table you can see item code which is pretty cool nice then we do like this we select the full colum always better to select the full colum three the colum number three and zero if you don't know how to do video C I recommend to follow my course because this is really basic now you have the price great the problem is like okay you have an update of the price you will have to control C control V all the time this is very very like not efficient let's say this file could be uh in the finance you have a finance folder and you don't even have to be to have everything to the same folder like you have the finance is updating the price every week or every month you connect to the file with power query and you don't have to do that open contrl c contrl v and I can see a lot of problem with the wrong pricing into Excel spreadsheet so let's go back into that and now let's do it automatically how we're going to do that we're going to go to data data get data from file Excel workbook great then we're going to go to the file data and price import so select your own folder it's going to connect huh interesting never had that before okay let's try again okay sometimes doesn't work because I'm using a share drive so maybe there is an internet connection problem it's good to see problems sometimes this is live okay and then you have two options load and transform data always click on transform data then you can check everything so transform data and now welcome to PO query okay so it looks scary if you never used that before but this is very simple and we I'm going to show you what is the most important you have the same table basically with the side the item code and you have like different steps so just to show you like you apply step like a macro you say oh okay this is the source then I found this then I promote the eers so I say okay this one is going to be the eers and then you change the type so you change the type like item code it's a you can change the type if you want say oh this is a number very important to pick the right format if you want to connect different tables this is text and this is number and this is text that's it so now we have this and it did all of this automatically and now we're going to go back to close and load close and load two and you have multiple options you can do table pivot table directly from an external file without having the table in your file a sh directly or just a connection you can also add this into the data model we can click on yes this is for power pivot this is more advanced but I recommend to you to to check this box if you want to connect multiple tables and we're going to press okay so now you have a new query perfect and we have the table price so you see this is exactly the same so you say but why do I need this said well this is the same this is not the same right why because now if I go back to my price Tab and I go back to my first for example and I change the price to 999 save the file try to do this as well go back to your file and now you see you can go back to this refresh H the price is automatic if I go back to this one nothing happened I have to go back contrl c contrl v I forgot oh I select the wrong column blah blah blah blah blah okay so you can see this is much much more efficient to do it this way I'm going to go back to the file and do I think that was the price CL you can even close it you can also update the file from data refresh all or refresh or refresh all you can also right click I think refresh like this boom this is automatic and you don't have to do it you don't even have to load the table if you don't need it so you don't need this one goodbye no more no more manual operation and now you can just change the video cap here and in the next episode I'm going to teach you how to stop using vup right boom so now we have the price we have an automatic update you just have to maybe finance will update this file once a week and you just have to press refresh and we're going to do this with all the data we need it's going to be much more efficient much more reliable because you don't have any manual error and that's why I love powerquery because it's so simple and there is no code and uh I really recommend you to use it if you never used it before
in this episode we're going to clean data data cleansing it's so important to clean data why because the data is not accurate we talk about before talking about forecast accuracy we talk about data accuracy because without right the right data it's not easy to have the right forecast so why do we have wrong data we can have difference between systems for example I was working between different Erp and system sap IBM for S400 and my warehouse system and we had different information between the stock the price the information of the product it could be like missing data like inventory Master data wrong apis like be have price missing or maybe just because of the computation time like I remember one of the system could get the information of the inventory immediately and the other one only eight hours after so sometimes we have we had times difference you can have also multiple data the same data like duplication or you can have negative data you can have incomprehensible data as well and that's why we want to keep it as simple and automatic as possible uh when we start focusing with this uh with this data okay so how to have relable data first of all you need to centralize always go back to the source with as little and few files as possible and the the more you will have application the more it will be complex to Define that so I recommend to always find the source also Define clear responsibilities who is responsible for which data for example for the price for the weight for the codes the Cod for me he was the the product manager was responsible for the the code creation uh the way was coming also from the the the product team the price was coming from the sales team so be very very clear what what is important and also what is active and inactive if you don't have the right information you will you will have a big trouble to forus correctly also it's very important to it's very obvious what I say but no one is doing it formalize the process maybe a mind map like this one uh shared and approved by everyone and also create automatic control tower uh what is a control tower you're going to check difference between system it could be just two one XEL spreadsheet or we check for example the itm C from one system and the other one it could be the sales and you can just V look up or use for query and see what the gaps every week or every month so I recommend to have all of this very automatic then you don't miss any data but at the end always try to get back to the source of the source then you don't have this problem anymore and to clean data we're going to start cleaning with for quiry and Excel uh I recommend to standardize first with the right format of the dates of the numbers be very clear when you use the do or comma be very clear so the colum of the the names of the column the name of your file files uh be careful of the text format and the number format because you cannot connect if you don't have the same format uh be careful what time you have the extraction in Excel in power query maybe you can use macro and also to clean we have multiple options that we're going to start practicing and if you want to see the full ones uh you can also have a look on my course uh talking about Excel exper as well okay so that's it for the the cleaning we're going to practice just after and also to integrate and consolidate data just for example in Excel I recommend to have the right structure make sure you have one file if possible or one file per site or one file per forecaster someone responsible for the forecast for my team at had the demand planning team he was the exact same file same templates for um everyone for everyone has an own file but it was exactly the same one there were no customization do not edit or import the data want to have the raw data and then to transform or correct the source directly One Source One one pivot table one don't try to me to have too many table into one sheet clear names as I said before merge the table as much as possible and with vup or could be also very useful if you connect with different segments into a dashboard I'm talking a bit fast but idea is just the what is important is to keep it s with one source very clear name and try to use the table format as explained before not just an Excel uh table like this one you know with this automatic color it's very useful for pivot table and also try to use as much as possible if you are an Excel po query then there is no room for mistake so that was the introduction now we're going to practice into Excel how to clean transform and integrate data
all right so now let's do some cleaning and transformation into Excel go back to the the file go to data cleaning exercise and you're going to open these two so the not clean first click and the clean there we go so I wanted to give you this exercise because I feel it's very um very Visual and you will understand why this is my unclean okay so this is the same I have a problem with the the item code you see there is a code then I want to remove this Bally I don't want this right and sometimes you have some very annoying text right same item name there is an Erp something like I want to remove this too right so that's the problem then I have my sales in quantity but this is very this is definitely not the format I want why I don't like the the horizontal format because you cannot really do a pivot table of this if I select all of it like this insert pivot table great the problem is you see like I cannot really okay what do I do is that colon like this it's very messy very very messy cuz I I cannot do like a graph or something like that why because this is horizontal I need to unpivot so what is not the good format the good format is this one oh not this one this one we call it the the vertical format this this is the database format you have one only have you have all the columns you want but you see this code for example if I filter on this code filter you can see that have multiple times the same code but different dates and different quantity obviously and this is the format you want okay cuz with this format you can really analyze and create for example this kind of shart automatically so you just have to um to insert a pivot table I recommend also to have a table format so you see the table design here this is a table this is not just a random if I go back to this one this is not a table you see to create a table you have to go to insert and create table here we did it before for for the skq list so very important to always use this format if you can and if I go back to my second file because I have this vertical format now I can create a pivot table when I do that I can have my categories I have my quantities and for example I want to do it per year boom op a quarter up you see so it's much easier to to analyze this way why because I have the right structure of the data and the problem is many company they don't have this when you extract the data you have something like this right many of you and I was speaking with many members they have something like because it's easy to read it's pretty easy to read like this but it's not easy to analyze when you want to create charts and a pivot table so what we're going to do in the next episode we're going to transform clean all of this automatically only in a few minutes then you don't have to do it again and you're going to repeat this operation automatically with power query
all right guys so few of you members told us that you had a problem is the date format so I'm going to tell you how to fix it it's it's very simple in my specific data set we're using the American United States format so we do have first the month and then the day and that's why because it's an American company and I just wanted to to make sure that it's clear for you like for example this number is is 1st of September not n of January okay so that's a different way for example if you're in Europe you have the same form you have the opposite and you don't have to do any manual operation to clean that you just have to go back to the par query so you go back to this file you go to data qu and connection TCH you open the file and you will just go to you can refresh after you will go to the date to this tab you go to date so last time we did just we selected the date format but this time you're going to use using local you can replace the current okay it's loading for the first time and what you going to select maybe you had the text format you're going to switch to dates and very important you have to select English United States so for example if you're in France or Switzerland it's going to select Switzerland automatically you have to go back and say you know I want the United States format it doesn't mean going to change for you but it's going to tell to par oh this is an American United States format so you press okay and now you're good to go don't forget to do it for every single query using a date format always use the American format I'm always using this one for this specific course and method then you click on close and load and for me is not going to change anything because I'm already using the right format for my computer but you should see all the months and all the format for the next episode so make sure this is correct make sure this is the same case for every single step with the date format inut query and I see you for another episode
okay so now let's go back to the previous file forecasting start 2 and we're going to add the says I'm not going to use the same data set because this one was very not clean so for this example we're going to use sales dollars and sales quantity so don't use this that I say was just to uh to show you the potential of power query so now let's go back I want to connect to this file that's an exercise for you we have the price now I want you to import this sales file in value let's have a look so we have the same structure this is not we need to unpivot all of this there is no problem with the name of the category or the code so I will just ask you to import this into Power query and to show the table we also have the price you we could remove the price but let's keep it just in case and you can pause this video go back to this file we just started transform the data and then we do it together all right my friends so let's do it now before we start I just wanted to be clear uh we we could have also the the sales per customer for example Amazon Walmart or different retailers but in this example we have a consolidation if you have all the clients I recommend to include this information into your power query table because then you can analyze everything so keep it as a rich as possible and if you have this information you will have another colum with the the name of your customer but you may have much much much more rows to process which is okay with power CR you can have millions of rows with no problem so now let's do it so let's go back to this file go to data get data from file I'm going to go fast because we've done it before we set except transform data and to get some water okay so like before use first row aser clack then we're going to select this to this and we're going to unpivot so transform and pivot the order column Tri now we have a date format date and the value is the sales value enter Perfecto we do have a item Cod is in number be very careful with that it's not in text and we go to file close and lo not two I want a table new worksheet and you can add this two data model now you have a relationship so you see you have 34,000 rows which is amazing super fast and we have this table great amazing now now we're going to do the same with the sales quantity we've done that before so we're going to connect with this file you can pause the video and do it by yourself and we're going to do it together very very quickly all right so let's do it t Tac sales quantity Tech s quantity transform data La treia use first row as either transform unpivot the other colum this is a date format date and let's call it sales quantity and let's go back to home close and load two table new worksheet I won't use this one into the data model you will understand why later CU I'm going to I'm going to merge this to table basically okay and now we do have the sales quantity and the sales dollar and if you want to refresh every month or every week you just press refresh all and under the right it will refresh automatically all the connections and include more data every week or every month which is pretty cool right so that's it in the next episode we're going to match sales quantity and sales dollars without any vup
okay my friends so in this episode now we have the sales in value and quantity and what I want to do in this one I want a v up but not a vup I want to connect the sales in dollars with the quantity then I can do more advanced report and for the forecasting process and the financial forecast it's going to be really good to have all of it so let's go we're going to go back to data the qu and connection go back to this one and we're going to go to we're going to go to match query so you go to the sales dollar one I'm going to include on the right of this table I want the sales quantity we're going to click on MH query and you can decide okay I want to add to this one or I want to create a new one so it's going to be a new table I don't need a new one so I'm going to click on MH queries great now what I'm going to do you have the sales table okay I want to connect with sales quantity right and now we need to select we need to find the connector like a V cup we need a connector what is the connector you have the item code so you can select item code and item code maybe you would have some privacy level blah blah blah you just press in your and save okay the problem is with that is I don't want if I look at this code I want to have the sales in dollars with the quantity at the same time not I don't want to have the same like I don't want this value with the the month of April when it's January so for that if you have this this topic you have to press control and you need to select a second connector so it's like a concatenation if you do a vup you want to connect with the item code and the date and you can see yes we have mat so we can do it so this is perfect great so now what we're going to do we're going to press t t t t we're going to press okay I know we have the sales quantity maybe what what can happen if it doesn't work is because you have one of the table for the item code or the date for example if you have a text format on one of the item codes and the other table is in the number format it won't work so be always careful if it doesn't work is because you didn't select the right format between the two table make sure you have always the same format date and text format so you can change but double double check that great so now we have this click I know I want to display on the quantity so you press here you don't want all of this again because we already have this information what do I want is only the sales quantity and you press okay CL so you can see you have this prefix is because I don't want this prefix basically so you can remove that you can uncheck the Box before okay so now we have the Sal quantity and the sales in value that's it we go back to close and load boom we can remove this Colum perfect now we have this and we have the sales let's go back to largest to smallest and know we have the sales in value and the sales in quantity which is very useful to have all of them with no VAP which is pretty cool now we don't need this table anymore so what we can do you can delete this table we can go to right click here load two and you just only create connection then you don't even display this table so your your file is much faster boom bye-bye and now we have the sales we have the price and everything is automatic and you can always update like this refresh all and you will have the sales dollars and quantity with clean data automatically
okay in this quick video I just wanted to show you that you don't even have to display this table if you want you can go back to this load two and you can remove you can you have a table but you can create for example a pivot uh table report and the table will disappear boom and now you can directly from this Excel file that you connected having sales in value with the date you like which is pretty cool right so you don't even have the table it's all connected all connected to the source that's why I love powerquery because it's very your file will be much lighter if you save it because there is no data there is just connection it's all about connection right so at the end I recommend you to really practice with that you can create also we can go back and say no you know what I don't want I just want a shot great and then you need to adapt this yeah this one doesn't work pretty well I recommend to have a yeah you need to deine okay what do you want in the shot so you want axis and you want sales for example up and now you have your shot so we're going to do a lot of micro analysis in finance but I just wanted to show you this specific example because I feel this is very useful uh that you can connect from millions of data point for example my friend from Amazon Mario he was using a PO query with all the data set and we're talking about millions of product and I was just displaying the data I wanted without having to copy and paste all this information into Excel so I hope you really understand the power of power query maybe it's already obvious for you but I really wanted to go back to this uh before moving to the next step because it's going to be much more efficient for you for the Automation and for all the process
in this quick episode I want to get back to the problem of connection you can have with your Excel po query so let's say for example we go back to this F and I rename they were the data folder and I change to data with an S it could be you change the name of the file the name of one of the folder be very careful you don't change anything but sometimes a problem happen and you have to be able to fix it and if you don't add my file you will have the same problem because you you don't have the same structure of your file in your laptop than in mine so now we can enable connections ta data and if I go back to my queries I'm going to start to refresh all oh there is a problem you see you can canel all of it because it doesn't work so how to fix that to fix that you go back to this you check for example to price and you have this eror oh my God this is a this is a this is a mess what's happening here so you can go to the error directly and is this one you can change here directly you can add an S here like this black or you can click here because this is less technical you click here and then you can browse go back to your file data and price select the file again with the new pass okay I'm not sure if it's going to go refresh preview refresh all all what you can do you can go to data source settings and you can also change the one so this one is is working I just have to close and load you can also change all of them in a one shot data source settings and you change the source so the first one was I forgot it was sales in value up import again and a quantity one change source quantity close I still have a problem with my price I don't know why that's weird I don't even see the price interesting yeah price okay sometime you have to repeat the operation because I'm in a share folder so maybe my connection just dropped that's why you close and load it's good to have problems in live then you can uh you see this is sometimes you have to repeat and now we are good to go so it's very important that you know how to play with that be careful with the name of the file the name of the folder the name of the the spreadsheet as well and the sheet because if it's if you change anything it's going to break down then you'll have to reselect the Source again but now you're ready to go and in the next modules and chapters we're going to start forecasting seriously
in this chapter we're going to talk about financial forecast and I think the best way to talk about Finance is to have a CFO a Chief Financial Officer uh in this chapter and that's why I call my friend Jeremy hello Jeremy how are you hello Ed I'm fine thank you so Jeremy and I we are we are very good friend from Brazil we met in Brazil I don't know what the first time we met I think it was at barbecue a Brazilian barbecue probably in s Paulo yes I think so and basically I was I was Supply chair manager for the catlon and you were working in finance for the pure group and that's how we met and we were traveling a lot exploring Brazil during the weekend you were my CFO to buy any equipment to for my barbecue and my and my weekends as as we can see on these pictures and also we were playing golf together and I I think yeah exactly and I don't remember that you you beat me one time did you do you remember uh yeah I think so I won sometimes I remember okay so now we're going to talk about another topic that you master much more than me Financial forecast but before that and I would be great if you could share more about your your experience who are you what did you do in your in your your career yeah so I started my career as a auditor uh on an international scope then I moved to Brazil uh for to develop uh to participate to to to to project of development of sub subsidiaries uh in p uh then I moved to gcd CO as a head of uh Financial Planning and in 2015 I decided to come back to France uh to start a position of CFO in a Distribution Company so always into uh very fast growing environment with a project of bi implementation structuration of new processes and now it's more or less eight years that I'm CFO in midsize companies and subsidaries of big groups yeah and I think what is good like because you are working for multiple Industries multiple countries and for me you represent the I would say the new generation of of CFO like model with a new technologies but also holistic approach and we're going to talk about it uh in the in the next episode but thank you for being part of this forecasting expert Jour in the next one we're going to talk about the cliche of what what is what is a bad CFO before talking of what is a good one and how to improve the forecast
all right so now let's talk about my friend the cliche of what is a what is what is not a good CFO and if you don't mind I'm going to start I'm going to I'm going to start the the the jokes and all all the stories like for me the the bad C4 I I few example in my experience is like someone okay really good with numbers but and basically you never see the CFO is always in his desk the door closed or is always talking with the CEO but you don't exactly know what's happening are they planning to lay off people or and I don't feel there were like trust between at the CFO I could feel he was not he was not trusting anyone he say you a good re so I don't even ask you what do you think about the forecast and they were doing their own forecast with uh the CEO that's of course cliche I want to exaggerate but what do you think of this of this stories I think you are completely right I already knew as well some people like this like ex accountant very technical and no self at all um they were always with a door closed um not really communicating to other people so exactly uh the typical technical guy and uh very hard to communicate with very rigid you know very rigid no no emotions I couldn't feel any emotions you know do you have emotions I have emotions yes I'm just kidding and not very involved actually into stret when office you have impression he doesn't understand very well what what's happening and this is exactly what we today companies that don't want this kind of profile so you don't want this kind of profile and so that was a cliche of the CFO of course you're not like that and many of you joining the method are not like that what do you think of the other department what are the cliche for you who is the for for you the wor Department to provide an accurate forecast is it sales marketing is it I Logistics supply chain what do you think I would say that most of the time we can have some difficulties to to talk about forecast with the marketing department yeah uh I would not say that they're the worst but well it's not the same um way of of thinking uh they are not very into figures as well yeah on on the other hand when you work with Supply Department you you work with people very more into into technical into figures much more easy to work with what about sales sales I work a lot with sales department uh because this is the one who who are involved into the development of the business uh who know very well their figures into sales into cross margin so most of the time CFO has a good relation with the sales yeah because let's say that the the profitability of the company basically it's made by the sales you don't sell any product you don't create create any value and you don't feel they amplifying the forecast like I I seen some say yeah it's GNA happen we're going to make the bonus and they tend like marketing to really amplify the real the reality sorry you don't you don't see like sales or marketing amplify the reality to make it bigger than it real the reality of course yes most of the time they are much more enthusiastic okay into the future uh as where there are people who are more into feelings as well so they can feel the market they feel the clients and as a CFO you bring a little bit of reality you are most of the time a little bit more in more into analysis and you you try to toize a little bit the these kind of people kind of excitement had to do the same supply chain to say oh you want to do plus 50% the market is gr by 5% maybe you're going to check the numbers right so thank you for the cliche in the next episode we're going to talk about it was cliche of course and I apologize if you're from sales marketing or or Finance but in the next episode we're going to talk about your role and responsibilities
so now that we talk about cliche let's talk about your real role and responsibilities about the forecast but before that why accurate forecast is important for you as as a CFO Jeremy um to my mind it's super important for CFO to have a good forecast because it's uh it's a way to get a better Vision on the financial flows first of all secondly I would say that it's uh you need to better understand uh the expenses and the revenue of the company so this is exercise of the budget it's very easy with a budget I would say it's a it's a very interesting tool to take decision as well because you you you with the budget you have a v a long-term Vision so you can easily take decision for the next year and uh of course you fix targets during the budget so you can involve people into the into these targets as well yeah and this is the best exercise for this and I think what we was saying before is like by having like crate forecast you can allocate the right resources at the right time for every Department investment people cash inventory and uh and you are the one who has the the checkbook so you are the one paying for that and that's why I think you need that what is what are your main challenges to have an accurate forecast in your previous companies or your current one I would say that the main challenge is to involve teams and all the teams every Department into the same targets yeah many departments they don't have necessarily the vision of what is a budget what is figures uh the necessity of of having a performance budget yeah and this is one of the target of the CFO yeah and so and what about the data as we're talking about the data do you have problem to get the right data well yeah this is as well a challenge is to to to bring uh quality into the data we provide to departments yeah and and then to get as well to get back some quality data in order to to to build the the budget figures yeah and when we talk about what is like what is your responsibility when we talk about forecast are you the one responsible to make the global forecast for the company or is it the CEO or is it the sales who is who is responsible for that for in your in your case um first of all I I would um as a responsibility as CFO I fix targets okay the glal targets of the company let's say what kind of turnover we want to reach next year what is what would be the gross margin etc etc so the big targets of the company it's not sorry it's not the CEO who giving you next year we have to do plus 10% depends on the organizations okay um for example now I'm more involved into this strategy so I Define with the co the global strategy and the global targets for the next years okay but you know company like for me I had the company where the C say we have to do this no just just cook the figures but find me a way to to plus 10% situation organization you have some company exactly this is the CEO who decide what are the Strategic targets okay and then the CFO needs to to to to to organize the budget in order to to reach these targets okay but I don't think this do you think this is the right way like comes from not necessary because I think that he needs as well to to to to to discuss with the CFO which has a good vision of the business which has a good vision of the performance yeah and to make sure that the targets are reachable by by people and that we can measure well so the CF is very important into the process nice and when we talk about like Global Target is it uh so let's go back to this you do just an overall Global forecast or you do a forecast per country or per site what kind of forecast do you do like which level of location saying to in terms of location we have a forecast which is organized um on a geographical way okay which mean by location by S okay uh so each site director is a is the master of his budget and he needs to defend his budget okay then the budget is organized as well if we are into this uh into this geographical view yeah weiz the budget as a by product segment yeah uh which is very important and by market so just when you talk about the product segment so you don't do the focus per product right Finance is not responsible per product you do the fin which is going to to do it this is the commercial Department yeah or and depends on the organization can be as well the brand the brand and product department or the suppl as well as well I was doing it so I know so you do a macro and then segment why segment and we not just total uh actually we do it by market first of all okay we analyze the market Evolution okay you analyze the market share of the company what are the Ambitions on the company of the company for the next year okay and uh and in terms of volume in ter of market share gain um and then we we go into the details and we Define it by market segment okay and not necessary Global because Market second you can have some specifically specificity by buy segment you can launch a new product inment so you need to consider this different scenario and then so then regarding the time you have a you have an annual forecast but do you do a quarter month week how do you how do you yeah we have an annual forecast we do it in October most of the time for the next year and then every month we compare the Real Performance with the forecast yeah uh uh we give to us the possibility to adjust we're going to talk about it after we're going to talk about it after and and and and we do a reforecast at mid year okay most of the time it's in June or July six first months okay Define the six uh the second semester based on the on the performance of the first semester okay so we're going to go back to the review after but just just confirm it's annual then it's monthly do you week or monthly uh we do it monthly okay do monthly most most of the time it's monthly and some company like retail they do weekly as well uh but most of the time it's monthly and uh you don't you don't Focus per quarter do you no no no we do it monthly and then uh one forecast per okay and regarding the question uh do you have I've seen companies and uh even my company I'm doing this like I do on the annual forecast I do three levels I do the you know the minimum budget to pay everyone then I do the good and then the the amazing forecast you know three level also for the bonus do you do you do that or like my experience is I always did just one forecast okay it's uh it's uh the truth let's say we have one truce and one Target and just one forecast we don't have different scenarios depending on the best case the worst case ET it's one forast but depends on organizations yeah yeah it depends on I think for the budget it's good to have one but for the commercial uh Drive I think it's good to have a different level to motivate the team between different but yeah thank you for that and in the next one we're going to talk about how do you forast
okay Jeremy so now we know your responsibilities uh now the question is how do you focus and the first one is how do you get the data from uh let's say you move to I Will Survive the the company that we try to save how do you collect data what is the tool and and then let's talk about forast let's say that's okay so most of the time you use the Excel uh to collect data there we go um and then you you try to produce the most the the better data you can in order to to to communicate to all the department and then they can work on a on a matrix which is which is a which is a good quality uh what is what is a good quality of a metrix for for you what are the the the the key points to have a good quality is it standardization is it like a what is the what are your secrets that you need to to have something exactly which is a with a standardization of your Matrix so you can use it from a year to another one yeah you this is more easy for people who are not used to to to work with figures so you need to make something super easy for them yeah and uh so this kind of Matrix is very interesting yeah and then is the quality of the data which means you need to to to to do the best to get uh quality of data because if you you don't get it you will have some difficulties to bring a yeah yeah great so we're cleaning the data in the previous chapter and that's something uh we we have to standardize and automate as much and then okay you have the data you have the sales you have the margin you have everything you want how do you focus how do you focus how do you get your number do you use machine learning or very complex mathematical formula no we do a macro it's more macro forecast okay and uh generally speaking what we work uh on first it's uh we work on organic growth which means uh with the actual Peter and the ambition into Market into gaining new market share what will be my forecast for next year yeah so just to show you just on the screen uh this is an example we're going to work in the next chapter in Excel but you can see first organic forecast and you could get the trend from the oh you going to maybe do you buy like some market share study for that like uh how do you get the information of the market sh or the the size of the market and the gross you can get some study study research study and on internet or you can buy them yeah and you can get some easily uh uh evolution of the market share of your activity perfect so you have this you have the organic forecast so that let's say oh you do plus 1.4% and then what do you do and then exactly what you you are showing you consider uh the opportunities you could have uh and you include the impact of these opportunities into your budget so it can be you launch a new product uh you you create a new market segment into your into your to your activities and then you can you can bring more value you bring more turnover more gross margin but as well need to anticipate the expenses you will get the pro maybe the investment you need to to forecast as well and this is a CFO which brings this kind of this kind of analysis and the last point is the risk because of course can have as well some risk you can lose some market share on a specific Market segment yeah you can lose a specific market for example and you need to to forecast it as well you need to anticipate and to measure the impact in your into your budget so for that like uh because you have the global picture but I guess you get information from sales from marketing from all the actors right exactly yeah the role of CFO is more to coordinate this kind of aspect and to be a real business partner with the other departments so of course you will not enter by yourself into the details of all these commercial aspect but you will bring a support to commercial directors brand and product Department yeah so I remember I was part of this coordination and uh for me I was really close to the CFO and we were doing this together because I was like in my role I was forecasting per product and had a lot of information that I could provide to the CFO uh and I think it was a he was it was a very good coll I always had a good collaboration with my C4 because I was helping him and he was helping me as well and yeah he was a real business partner so thank you for this example we're going to practice more into after and in the next video we're going to talk about how to review and adjust the forecast
okay so now Jeremy you have your annual forecast gr and then you start you want to do plus 10% and uh after a few months you realize you're not doing plus 10 you're doing minus 10% what do you do you wait until the end of this year you say oh too bad I didn't get my goals or when do you the question is how do you review when do you review and with whom like how does it work for you um as we said previously so we we actually we use a budget uh every month because we compare the Real Performance with with the monthly budget we Define during the process okay in this example for example I would say it depends or this is an effect that I could um I could recover in the following months so I say okay I don't do any adjustment because I consider that the next month I could compensate this negative effect yeah or I consider that it's something that he lost and then I need I can uh I give the possibility to make an adjustment in my forecast okay so it could of course I will adjust uh my year forecast yeah lower than previously Define and how do you do that you check the global or you you going to check which segment or Market is completely out of the scope or how do you do how do you do you focus on the main Gap you know like how do you do that usually during the the year we we are more into a global yeah yeah we make a global adjustment okay and then during the exercise of the mid reforecast we will go much more deep into the information to to adjust more into okay the figures so so monthly is more macro and uh at the the middle of the year you really focus on which segment market and you review We redo a mini budget process okay and we we focus more into the details okay and for that like for the monthly uh you do you do like official meeting every month or you just uh is it like uh is it only at the end of the mid of the year that you really gather everyone to explain what's going on or to rec coordinate um every months I communicate the figures to all the Departments so everybody is involved into the performance and if we talk about adjustments this is more discussion I have with the with HQ and the controlling Department of the HQ to decide if we change if we adjust or not search expenses or margin or turnover into the forecast okay so that's great and what we're going to see later in the in the course is you have the macro and also how to compare uh like you know the sum of all the forecast per product versus the micro forecast and if we are very far do you do also this top down the bottom up an this or is it someone from another team who do that no we do it we do it and I have business controllers who who are specialized into this uh into this aspect so they are responsible of of building these data okay on a transversal way which means on all the s of the company yeah we're going to talk it in the next one but it's a it's necessary to check the total but also if it's if it's much what if you have a you do production or distribution to make sure that these two numbers are not disconnecting and in many companies it was very disconnecting like the macro was plus 10 but in the system they were buying for plus 30% or minus 10% the Gap analysis for for me with the CFO once again was very very important and we're going to go more into details after thank you in the next one we're going to talk about how to automate and Empower your team
all right so now you have the forecast you review the forecast but let's prepare let's talk about Automation and the future of of the forecasting as well first you say like you you start the process with Excel uh but you also told me you did a lot of project transformation U do you recommend any tool to improve this process yeah yeah I think that uh I think that CFO needs to bring value as well into the processes and uh I would say that on this topic uh I I worked about business intelligence uh implementation in two companies bi implementation which is very powerful in this exercise of budget yeah um why because first of all in in terms of retrieving datas it's much more easier to retrieve data from a bi system because you have all the historic the actual figures organized by market segment by product by article is very precise so it's very powerful um to communicate this kind of data to to teams and when when you set up your targets for the next years you can integrate this data into your bi and then on the frequency you choose uh to to to track your performance can be a daily performance can be a weekly a monthly performance you will get already all the datas uh from the budget register in your system so it's will be much more easier to communicate to people and to to to track your performance and the bi has a big Advantage as well you can gather and you can involve people from different Departments of the company into a common Vision into a common strategy Yeah by uh by a diffusion of the Capi to all these kind of population so it's very powerful yeah to to to fix targets to to to have a diffusion of of your capis into the organization and uh and to track the performance during the so I think I think at the end like I think it's important to do it fast uh quickly with excel at the beginning but then it's it's important to have a a projection and you are directly involved and leader of this project transformation and I think it was important to reflect which one is your favorite pobi click view business subject I I set up the solution Tableau okay ah Tableau yeah okay which is uh very interesting because it's very user friendly very easy there is a very easy to understand very easy to in terms of functionalities people who are not very used to to to work with figures to work with kind of tools so but click view is very nice as well PBI they are all very powerful uh for this exercise nice so we talk about system now what about your team do you do everything by yourself or how can you Empower and give a delegate to your team um what I like it's to to it's to to split the responsibilities which means uh I have business controllers and uh each business controller is specialized into a part of the business for example I have one business controller which is specialized into the commercial performance so it's taking care of all the aspect from the turnover until the gross margin yeah so it's directly into contact with commercial directors directly into contact with marketing as well because marketing when you want to launch a product to develop a turnover you need to bring marketing actions as well so you treat all the all the canal uh from the top to the to to the down and on a transversal way which means on all the sites and then I have another business controller which is more specialized into tracking following and controlling exp expenses yeah controlling capex Investments and uh and this makes a good complimentarity into the team yeah I think I think it was the same for the demand planning team for example of forecasting I prefer to have someone like completely from the production to the distribution that that we really understand the market and all the expect of the company than just someone very uh in his box that doesn't know what happened before and after uh because the more you understand the market and what happened before the more you can uh you you can have a job to analyze correctly the forast and improve it and make it make it more accurate so I think that's a good example we're going to talk more about these responsibilities later but thank you for sharing your your own experience thank you [Music] bu partner communication SKS to to bring some transformation transformation [Music] to try to be as close as they can to the CFO because if they want to to grow their [Music] business okay so now Jeremy to to conclude this uh this mini episode with you um I'm I'm going to ask you advice for people who work in finance CFO or in the department and also for people working with Finance so first of all what kind of because we have many people from Finance joining discour what kind of advice can you give for people in finance about forecasting I think that today CFO uh what we are looking for for C4 is not necessarily technical skills uh which is it's of course very important but it's as well soft skills yeah into these soft skills I would say uh first of all being a business partner which means uh to to to to to be close to people to to try to bring a vision and to to make to bring a sense as well to what we do and business partner as well for the CEO yeah needs to take some strategy decisions and the CFO is there to to bring some value on this aspect uh second points uh I would say that the CFO today he has new challenges of digitalization and needs to be uh the one who will uh lead some transformation projects like digitalization uh to improve the processes to make them more performance yeah business intelligent implementation which means that as we said before very high value into Capi monitoring yeah so these are the main points I would say that are important for for CFO today yeah nice and not only the CFO but anyone working in finance I feel and what about people like for okay I mean supply chain sales or marketing what how what are the recommendation you you you you could say to work with Finance I would say that um the my recommendation is to try to be as close as you can with a CFO in your company yeah because he has a lot of information he knows capis he know the the details and if you want to develop the value of your business if you want to to to find a way to improve to to be more efficient into your expenses for example to optimize your gross margin the CFO can be a really good partner to yeah get these objectives so I think that's a good conclusion is what I wanted to bring you first because you're my friend but you again you present the new generation holistic not only technical but s skills of uh of finance and we can see it in your career you grow you grew very fast with a multiple position very young in your career and I think the message is like don't be afraid with Finance they can really support you help you and the idea of this method is really to uh to reconnect all the department starting with Finance because Finance has a lot of power a lot of information and they are not only controlling but they can really support you to improve the but support your business and also support the accuracy of your business so thank you so much Jeremy see you very soon to play another Golf and see who is the best it be a pleasure and uh and thank you for being part of this forecasting exper Journey thank you
in this chapter my friend we're going to start forecasting in Excel finally we're going to start with the financial and micro forecast we were talking about it in the last chapter with my friend the CFO but now let's I'm going to show you multiple way to to do it uh to uh analyze your data uh to Define what what would be the first of all what will be your annual Target for next year if you had to if you if you are the CEO the CFO of your company I think this is a really important point to start so we're going to play with like anual Target we're going to analyze the data we're going to talk about risk risk opportunity market share uh we're going to do multiple way then we're going to spread the forecast per month monthly forecast with multiple methods and we're going to do as well what we call segment forecast uh like not top down but bottom up forecast starting from the the subcategory so a lot of exciting things to do and uh before that you should uh you can download this file uh it's called fusing Finance ABC supply chain uh you have to enable the content if you want to play with the same file you will have to go to data query and connections and you will see you will have a problem uh because of the source so you just double click I explained that in the in the in the chapter how to clean and extract data and basically you just have to change the source so you can click on data source setting and then you just double check if you have the right you just connect to the same file we were using for the the the data cleaning uh chapter so you go to Excel for casting data you own the folder and you update you change the source with your own destination pass folder all right okay now it should be okay refresh what about this one let's give a try again sales H let me check this yeah sales okay sometimes you have to repeat because I have a share folder and sometimes the connection is not great so then you close and I think we're ready to go let's give a try Okay so the file is ready and now we can uh we can U talk about how to focus seriously okay great so now let's talk about first what we call top down Focus or bottom up forus that's a really important questions should you for example let's say you have this company I Will Survive should you take for example the forecast per customer per site per store do the sum of all these forecast to generate what will be your Global forecast or should you just forecast the total level you say like the total revenue of this company and just do a micro forecast and this is a very important question and there is not like an absolute answer um some company for the financial for we just take the total and just estimate the total some companies will do the same as my friend Jer was explaining the CFO per Market or per region or per country or per segment and what we're going to do we're going to do a different way to do it in the next episodes I just wanted to go back to this as well to be honest if you don't have a long experience in forecasting it's always easier to forus the bigger is your perimeter is your volume the the easier will be your your forast why for example let's say you have the Apple Apple company it's much easier to or the GDP of the world it will be much easier to forecast yes it's going to vary by 1 or 2% next year then the sum of all the countries and region on the planet because when you have small forecast with small revenue or small quantity or small consumption uh you will also have probability to have a like higher volatility and error and then you're going to start summing a lot of Errors small errors and at the end you have a lot of noise in your forecast so there is the clear answer is you should do the same the method is the the most accurate so you should try all of them but to be very honest the bigger is your perimeter on your volume the easier will be to have an overall accurate forus but then you also need to forus per product if you want to buy so the the the real answer is like he's doing Amazon there is a top down forecast Financial forecast from the global level or segment level and there is a product forecast and in the next chapters we're going to compare these two to see if they're not too far away we're going to do Gap analysis so I just wanted to go back um to this top down and bottom up we're going to do the top down we're going to do the top forecast the micro forecast and then we're going to do a bottom up starting from the category and subcategory uh in the next episode uh that's what we're going to do I
all right so now I'm asking the question to Mario is it better to do a bottom up forecast or top down forecast what is the best way at Amazon to do it yeah at Amazon we do both basically so we do the top down owned by finance and we do the bottom up owned by basically the the forecasting team who's who's responsible for the algorithms but also some people like me who's also responsible for the process and knows exactly what kind of overrides what kind of changes the sales tee apply to the the system forecast okay and then there are gaps so we we have Bridges to uh check the gaps and then for example if there's a 5% Gap then you have to detail uh where it comes from so you have to say of the 5% Gap 1% is due to uh 05% is Du two and then another 1% is Du two and then you have to detail you know extremely careful where where this Gap is coming from and each time is is a bit different okay um and it's it's it's a very very uh uh um important process okay not taken is taken very very seriously processes so the finance is doing is on a big big forecast do you know if it's only top like top top or it's per category or per subcategory or no it's only top top it's per country it's a overall per country okay okay by done by Finance it's also done by a machine by the way it's also done by a machine I mean people in finance can edit it yeah change it somehow if they if they think they they need to change it uh there's something the machine is not aware of but it's is it's automatic and and the same thing for the bottom up personally I think it's a very uh um recursive project process sorry uh so basically uh no matter who owns it okay um there is always u a a conflict okay there are multiple people wanting different numbers okay uh I think the the the question is when you have when you compare the bottom up to to a kind of top down um it's what kind of action do we put in place to be sure that the bottom up uh um reach the same level as the top down okay if if the bottom up gives us 5% and the top down gives us 20% yeah so we have to we have to what it means it means we have to put some actions in place for example increase the number of products okay or increase the number of marketing spending uh to be sure that the even the bottom up matches matches stop down and also the other way around is true if if the the bottom up is too ambitious we're going to end up over buying okay so we have to be sure why it's so ambitious and then we have to reduce it you know depending on is it comes from a specific category a specific country and reducing accordingly yeah and that was uh yeah I think that's why the the conclusion of the this is UN need both and that's what we're going to do during this course we're going to do both and compare them and I was one of my major main job when I was snop manager one of my main job was to fill the Gap we had an over realistic forecast from finance and the CEO because we had a lot of pressure in one of my company and the system was not believing the Micro Focus we had to explain okay what is missing guys but we had a huge gap and I think that's a very very powerful process also to align all the department together and that's what we're going to do during this course so thank you Mayo for that
okay so now what we're going to do first we're going to do like micro analysis we're going to start digging into the data and that's what I do when I Consulting on new clients member I like to I love numbers and I really wanted to give you this uh this appetite for analysis before doing all of these so what I recommend to you is to use the the forecasting start uh what we build last time so we just to keep in mind we we connected this file with the the data set so keep in mind we connected with this file like the price the sales the sales quantity we merge we clean the data so that's a very efficient way because you don't have to copy and paste anything is completely automatic and from this file now you can just pivot table different reports that going to help you to understand what's going on in this company so what we're going to do first we're going to we're going to do a pivot analysis so we're going to do insert pivot table from EX data source you're going to choose a connection and I'm going to go the sales in value we're going to focus really on the sales in value because this is the financial forecast you can of course do it the same principle with quantity with consumption with volume but I wanted to focus on this one first uh new worksheet up we're going to press okay this is the first time so no is creating the connection and let's let's give a try what let's see how looks the forecast not the forecast the sales not yet we're going to talk about the forecast after so this is my Revenue per year let's give a try no like this okay I can see this is my Revenue per year if you never done pivot table before this is very useful can design click on I like when it's black like this nice so you I want to do it okay this is per per year I want to do it per maybe per month to see what's going on you can see we had the big peek in 2020 21 22 and 23 is not over so if you like you can change the color of the last year to see that this is not the full year up nice you can also add if you like data label to see what what was the revenue you can change the format to make it up like this nice now you can see the value let's do it now per per months so I'm going you just copy and paste your your previous uh Tab and then we're going to go back to the field if you don't see the field on the right just just click on pivot table analysis and I forgot yeah F this this one up then we're going to remove here quar I'm going to leave only the months not not even the months I just need the date up very important to have a date format in your table in your data source you can convert with powerquery we've done that before but it's very important to have date and not period like with text format very important okay so now we do have this uh we do have this uh values I'm going to remove no not this way like this and what you can do you can do another shot so we're going to select very important you do it with me and you don't watch me or maybe you do your own analysis the goal is really to understand what would be the forecast in 2023 without knowing let's say you are we are in a the goal of this first video is like let's say you are in at the end of 2022 and you have to forecast next year so usually we do the forecast in October for the year after but let's say you have the full uh data of your last five years from 18 to 22 and you want to Define what would be the forecast next year what would you analyze before taking the decision are we going to do 40 40 million 45 50 that's what we are looking for right now so I've done this and I'm going to create a graph so insert shot like this and you can see okay interesting my friend I can see that there is some Behavior like it looks like in summer like June July a you have a you have a peak something happened in 2020 that was the pandemic and for the bicycle industry there was a huge pick a massive pick and after we had a like a back to normal I would say um interesting T tac tac I'm going to remove the last one because it looks like August is not full click not just to let you know you can and we're going to talk about this later if you right click you can add a trend line you say Okay interesting there is a trend going a little up not that fast based on the last five years history the more you have history the more it will be easier so you can see okay there is a I can see there is a cycle there is a seasonality this one I I think is not relevant so I will not base on this one and it's going up a little bit but not great because we had this terrible not terrible this massive Peak a few years ago um so that's what what I will say first and now after having this first information what we're going to do uh we're going to start thinking of okay what will be the forecast next year and that's what we're going to do in the next episode I'm going to tell you different ways to forecast your your mcro financial forecast
okay so now in this episode we're going to do the first annual Target Global forecast where the idea is really to Define what would be the budget for for next year uh with multiple methods so let's go back to the graph to the the previous file I recommend as well to do with me and try try to guess what would be your target for next year without checking my file so we're going to do like this just just before we start you can also in this analysis or in this one you can add some filters so you can say oh you know what when I do a filter like this you can say oh I want to see just electric bike huh it's going up or BMX ha it's going down or closing ha it's more stable so you can really play with that you can also do the same category or even subcategory filter if I go back to electric bike you can see there is a strong Trend and not the same for B MX for example okay so that's the filter I like to use to observe play with that now let's try to Define what would be the target next year let's let's consider the 2023 in this data set doesn't exist and I'm the CFO or the CEO you are the CEO and you need to Define your target it's very important because this target at the beginning of the year will really Define uh what you have to do and uh this is a usually a big topic that is not very always shared by everyone in the company so what we're going to do we're going to invert this I'm going to switch to years here I'm going to remove my dat so I want this is my all my revenue and I want to Target next year I don't need a ground total doesn't mean anything for me so I'm going to go to design gr total I just want the colon no the gr total yeah I just need this perfect so we do have the revenue for this um for this year and I would like to know okay what will be my target for 2026 so you can do equal uh this one equal plus then you have 2023 it's automatic if you do it every year then it's automatic try to make it as automatic as possible then what would be the I'm going to move this one I'm going to call it budget then what you can see is that okay but how do I Define this number so what I'm going to do first I'm going to calculate the gross what will be the gross I'm going to do this so when I click like this I don't like you have get you can do like this if you want but usually I don't like it because then when you do uh this is the gross of 19 versus 18 but when I do like this I don't think yeah it doesn't work it doesn't move so what I do for that I don't like to get the get pivot data I just type J5 divided by F5 other than 2% minus one to have the percentage of gross you can go gross gross nice and then you do like this clack and you have the percentage of gross great we're going to do a conditional formatting home conditional formatting and you have two option or you do the green are the the biggest value or the opposite so I'm going to do this one up now we have a conditional format and you can see that 20 2020 was a huge Peak and then minus 18 and minus two so you can see that yeah we have this peak but now it's start to stabilize again also I had a chat with the the CFO B LOF and you told me that in 2018 we did plus 5% I say Okay Plus 5% great plus 5% just to have an idea if you don't have enough historic at least ask the question maybe to your finance department what was the result before the more you will have information the easier it will be to calculate then you say okay great but what will be my budget for next year in value and I'm going to tell you you have multiple way to do it we're going to do a very intuitive way and we're going to do a Roundup Way and then we're going to do more analytic way what would be the intuitive way as a CEO and as a as a CFO and I I spent a lot of time to Define these targets for very small but also billion dollars company it's important when you fix a Target it's easy to understand and read so when I see all of this I okay we had a big peek then we had to recover now we're getting back to normal clearly I want to do more than last year because I need to recover and um we can see later we can see that the trend the market is growing again finally so I will do a run number I say okay more than 42 um I think I will go to I will run or to 45 or to 50 million so let's do 45 and see what will be the value of 45 what would be the gross value so you say when I do 45 million I have a grow of 5% which on the paper looks okay you know like it looks possible it looks achievable this is an but this is easy to say guys next year we do 45 million okay so you could do this way with using a wrong number in value or we can do the wrong number in percentage so because when you look 5% at the end is not 5% it's 5. 55. 496 right and what what you could do as well say you know what next year we're going to grow by 5% so run number 5% and what would give 5% in value it will give G five so this value times 1 + 5% okay so that will give me 44 Millions 44 788 Millions US dollar okay so this is another way to do it or you can use like this some company will use the Run number for Five like for like in percentage other company will use the wrong number in dollars or you could say you know what next year let's go crazy we go 50 Millions no 4 Millions 50 millions that that will give us plus 17% gross so I just wanted to give you that because many companies they do like this and I was in a company next year let's do 15 billions another one let's do and even with my company we have a school and we have a very run Target for Revenue but also for the number of students you don't say oh next year I want to have a I want to have 9 and uh or 9,977 you say no let's have 10,000 new new students that enjoy the our course and school next year so that's the first way the intive and Runway uh I I do respect this one because it's easy to communicate it's a wrong number and then everyone is online there is some limitation is because there is no like much analysis behind or you could have some analysis but at the end uh we're going to do that in the next episode
okay so now in this episode I'm going to talk about three level of forecast and it's not the case for all the company but in many company I can see that there is a budget you say okay the budget is let's say 4 five million this is to pay everyone the bills and make sure that at least we can sustain our company but then we need some excitement right we need some uh challenge for the company especially in sales marketing for everyone say you know what we can do this is the minimum maybe to activate the bonus in your company but you want to do more so what I like to use is to use three level the budget the good or the better you can create the good and the amazing okay you can create it also this one sometimes uh better sometimes I call it good better amazing or budget good amazing and this one you can also use an intuitive way you can say you know what the amazing will be to to do 50 Millions I like to do start with a big one p 50 not five and in between let's do you know what 47 or 48 clack so what would be this percentage of gross we're going to do this like this and what I'm going to do this is not the right calculation I want to compare with 2022 so I'm going to go back to this one I'm going to freeze pressing f4 on my keyboard to lock the formula and now I can do that and now this is this number is accurate so you can see okay let's guys let do plus 133% that will be my run number 48 and 50 Millions maybe we can even do like just in the middle 4 but I don't like this number like 47.5 47 Millions 500,000 I like to keep it like this okay now would be that would be the good and the amazing now you could do the same you say you know what I prefer percentage so let's do 5% 15% I'm going to do like this same format so 15% and in the middle let's do 10% at the end you don't have necessarily the same value we're going to freeze this formula and that will be my target if I want to have run percentage that would be 44.7 four almost 47 and 49 Millions if I want to do plus 5 plus 10+ 15 so that's different way to uh Define your overall budget it's simple it's efficient of course this the real question is how did you get the five and this number why not 25 or 30 of course it comes from experience and if you know the company for many years you know what is possible and what is not and in the next episode we're going to talk about more like multiple way to go more into details and to go deeper or to Define these numbers but I'm wanted to also to introduce you this idea that you can have different numbers also from the minimum to the the amazing also to celebrate to give maybe more value to your colleagues and to your company to share the profit of your and and the success of your company most of the company I know that have a sustainable growth they also uh share the the value and their growth with the employees and I think it's very important to do that whenever you have a very small or very big company
okay so now let's talk about what we call the market share forecast uh the market share forecast we were talking about with the CFO in the previous episode and you can you can go back to the fusing Finance ABC Supply Chain how does it work basically you need to have what's happening you need to have information about the market so on the bicycle market for example in the US I found two link these two the bigger is your Market the easier will be to find the information and you can see for example this one um T tac tac so the market is 6.8 billions ebik for example grow by 240% we could see that in the chart of the company as well the number of bike the number of bicycle produce um yeah a lot of statistic that you can get and most of the time if you want details you have to pay for it and many of my company I was working with we were paying for it because it was very important to so how how how fast is growing the market what is the average price uh what is the what are the top leaders if you can see track B 22.5% giant specialized etc etc and this is another one that you can buy and you can see that they were they were expecting a big gross in 2021 which is was not accurate because we had the pandemic in 20 and I can tell you that the market crashed completely in 2021 in the US and not only in the US so it's important to also have some U be careful that what you get from this stud is not always 100% accurate but it's it's a good way to have an ID and I know many companies that will forecast based on their market share so how to do that first you need to have the information then to say okay in 2022 for example the total Market was 6.9 billion and the company I Will Survive is the formula coming from my pivot table say okay I did 42.6 million great then I can calculate my market share my market share was Zero you just divide this by this and you have market share 0.618 the problem is like I think this is relevant your market share when you have more than five or 10% of market share in your total Market if you have like less than 1% the variation can be um quite big and you also have to be very careful what is part of the market are you selling all the products of the market maybe you are selling bikes but not ebikes you're not selling clo clothing bike so you have to be also very careful what is inside or what is not because sometimes you don't really represent the market if you don't have the same segment or product but anyway let's say that this is relevant and then you need to have the prediction of the market for next year for example let's say like next year they plan to do s billions so at the end the growth of the market will be 1. 4% and at the end you can estimate okay what how you going to Define your target for next year you're going to Define what would be my my market CH next year and let's say that in this specific example we're growing faster than the market we have new products coming so we're going to say we're going to Target 0.65 okay it's not easy to say okay why 0.65 and why not 0.68 but at the end like um I think you need to to check what is the dynamic of your company versus the other company are you launching new new new products we're going to go back to this just after um above but at the end you can plan a market share and then how to get the total revenue you're going to just multiply the market size times your new market share and you will get what will be your um your Target in value in this case that will be 45 million and 500,000 which is close to the the previous Target we did but the total gross design will be 6.7% okay so that's a way to to forecast as well the macro uh my friend Jeremy the CFO was in this the last company forecasting the market share and other companies they use their own data it really depends what is your Market but I wanted to share you this example even if this is not the most relevant for for this company but what I really like in this example is to know what is the trend of the market and you can use this and we're going to use it in the next episode
okay so now my friend let's talk about risk and opportunity forecast so we were talking about market share before um a way to forecast your your financial forast but not only you can also do it for Segment or categories is to have this um this logic that I really like and I've been doing a lot is like you have your organic forecast your opportunity and your risk and this is your final forecast so what is the organic forecast what we were talking before with the CFO the organic forecast is basically what is the if you don't do like big change what will be your natural gross next year based on new new natural gross in your company but also the growth of your market and for example you say oh but the market is growing by 1.4% next year that's that's a market and that's what you can see in the in the numbers so let's say okay in 2022 I did 42.6 so I'm going to add 1.4% and at the end I will have 43 Millions okay 43 million that's my organic forecast and there is a high probability that the market will grow like this so ATA my final value is the same okay then you have opportunity to say you know what but we're going to have amazing projects and products coming so it could be products it could be a new clients new distribution you could be a marketing compan it could be like anything that will stimulate the organic sales or it could be consumption if you have a factory or whatever so for example there is this U product Direct director Elon Mar who wants to launch a new flying bike collection this is very ambitious but he say like we can maybe start by the end of the year it's going to be $3 million of sales but you know what the probability is quite low because the the manufacturing companies say it's complicated we don't know if the pricing point will be good enough so at the end the probability is very low and I really like to use probability um that's something I really like because if you talk with Finance marketing and sales they will Al always give you yes it's going to happen it's going to be amazing but sometimes the probability is very low so I like to ask or to challenge okay but did you sign the contract do you have any or did you already launch the production in your factory and we like to Define not only myself but with the during this consens like consensuous meeting uh how to what would be the the the estimation of the probability it's never perfect but I like to have a number and and I like to do the final value based on this initial value and the probability so I'm going to just going multiply 3 million by 20% right that's just to give you an idea then another one you know what my sales director told me I have under new Walmart so it's a big Supermarket group in in the US that you probably know I have two I have new uh 100 new stores in the US uh that going to distribute my product and we were estimating with the say director that that every new store is selling $20,000 of our products so 20,000 time 100 we have 2 millions and the contract is already signed there is very few details to conclude so at the end there is a high probability that we're going to do more Revenue thanks to this new deal so you know this is not organic this is new and we're going to take 90% of the value then we have this phone holder marketing campaign uh we're going to really push this uh new product on the market and how to do that you can do estimation or for example after that just to give you an ID we're going to analyze per segment per subcategory and when we look about the phone holder the phone holder revenue is $15,000 per year and they said we're going to Triple the revenue because that was a very small category but the probability we don't know exactly if the marketing will be strong enough uh so we're going to we're going to do 50% so at the end we're going to just plan to double the revenue of this category this is not a big impact at the end you see $155,000 then maybe you have a new closing woman collection coming uh it's going to be $400,000 of new products exciting products we have a good probability so this is the value so at the end the organic forecast will be this plus all of this so at the end you say why we're going to do 46 millions of dollars the problem is we also have risk we have risk that we're going to lose do some business multiple race it could be like capacity or supply chain production let say we already know that we have some issues with like the battery production for the electric bike that's a problem or we going to have less Amazon exposure even twice like in the overall but on the first page as well as this is a probability and uh BMX bikes will be um discontinued from the Walmart distribution and we already know that the total value is going to be $200,000 next year so you can add multiple example I really like to do it this is just a small one but add a very long list not only Global but perment and I was working there with Finance with sales with marketing with product to um to be very clear I would just highlight that don't lose your energy if it's something very small like for example this one at the end is not very relevant for the total forecast if you remove this one it will almost doesn't change anything so in this specific case I would say like you need to have at least 50 or1 100,000 impact that is part of your risk opportunity otherwise you're going to lose your focus always focus on the biggest impact the two biggest impact are this one make sure that you have a new flying back collection because if you move the probability from 20 to 50% you're going to increase your Revenue by basically almost $1 million and make sure that this one is happening as well okay at the end the total will be the sum of all of these in this one I have a negative value Nega negative sign and at the end we have okay organic plus opportunity minus risk we have we are again close to 45 Millions it will it will make more sense to believe this number than just the intuition total number because I have more information and um at the end when you talk about micro forecast it's good to use all this method and see if you have a consensus if you can find a similar number and if you don't find a similar number I will go into the risk and opportunity Matrix uh to make sure that you can explain why are you are growing that fast or not enough based on your on your all your hypothesis okay so that was an introduction to how to do a macro forecast at the annual level in the next episode what we're going to do we're going to start talking about monthly targets how to spread the forecast per month and that's what we're going to talk about
okay my friends so now we do have a macro forecast let's say we do 45 Millions next year yes we can do it but we need also more details what would be the forecast per month if you don't have like a guideline per month it will be not it won't be easy to know if you are on track on Earth every month so what we're going to do now we're going to spread this forecast in multiple way we're going to start in a very basic way and then we're going to start talking about seasonality so what we're going to do first what would be the most easiest way to forast let's go back to this file we're going to spread the forast per let me check what we're going to do we're going to copy this one up we're going to just paste like this and we're going to do per months so let's do per mons like this let's remove the filter trivia ground total like this you know what you can also change the color if you don't like the color I'm very picky with design you click like this and do like I like blue for example ah I like now this is cool this is cool just some bold and now we have numbers so we can see let's do a graph with that insert let's have a look how how does it look you can see that the there is a the the revenue is not flat in this company I'm going to change the design in Black like this so we can see that the the revenue in this company is not flat we have a strong seasonality looks like that January and febr very low and November and December as well but you have a big Peck in this in this time let's remove just the 2020 because it was a mess and then you can see okay look like we have the same Trend like it's it's following like spring and summer and then it's declining again and I really recommend you to observe this on a graphic we it's much easier than just reading numbers like this not easy you can also do like this if you like to see with colors like this and the red are the small one and the green are the big one but you're also growing every year so it's not easy to read all the time so we have these numbers we have this grow and now I want to spread my focus so what would I do I will go back to 2020 the first way will be to say you know what I want to keep it very simple I'm going to do equal my target 45 millions or I'm going to do 45 Millions here equal click and I want to do the same value every month so I'm going to do this F4 to lock the formula divide by 12 boom so that will be my forecast every month very simple I'm going to call this one a flat uh forecast flat monthly forecast like this and this is a graph of my forast taada you like it doesn't look very professional but at least you know what this is a beginning and I've seen many companies they don't even do that so they don't have a um um like a monthly forecast you could do exactly everything I'm doing per month you could do it per week this is the exact same process most of the companies they do monthly forecast and then quarter forecast but some retail company they do per week because they have strong seasonality but you will be the exact same principle okay so I will call it monthly forecast great so now you say you know what Ed I don't really like it I don't really like it's a bit too basic for me so let's first check the growth of your um of your month's forecast I'm going to do like this equal to R4 I'm building the file with you but if you don't practice you will never learn just to be very clear so don't look at me uh passive be active yes you yeah am looking to you yes you can pause this video few members told me I'm going too fast others told me I'm too slow you can accelerate or slow down the video if you feel I'm not going fast enough or too fast all right so now let's go the to the gross r five divided by P5 minus one what's happening no it was not P5 Q5 nice good job then we do like this clack clack you know I'm always doing the same it's very uh and you can see the growth 2022 was not a great year except for July and August and yeah I think this is a good way to start now you know what what I'm going to do I'm going to keep it very simple what I want is I want to grow have my targets per per month it's 5 the total is 5.5 so what I'm going to do now I'm going to say I want to grow next here 2000 I'm going to do equal this or you can create 2023 forecast we I'm going to grow by 5.5% I'm going to equal here great and what I'm going to do I want to do this so every month I'm going to log this and do like this clack and every month I want to do the same growth okay easy so what would be the value it will be just 2022 so U 5 time 1 + 55 great and then I'm going to spread this and I'm going to do the sum to see if this is the the same value o we have this the same value and how does it how does it look in the forecast let's do it do it again select data I'm going to change the Ser of this one to the sir name flat forecast and now I'm going to add a new one edit no add and I'm going to take the value up ah not too bad now we do have something more relevant you can see that it's close to the same shape and I think it's much better because why why do you think is better because otherwi if you have a flat forecast it would be super super easy to grow at the beginning of this year because uh you will have a no super difficult because January and February are very low very uh quite easy during this time and super difficult at the end of this year so don't do flat forecast if you have a seasonal business if you don't have a seasonal business this is okay this is not perfect yet I'm going to tell you why in the next episode
okay so now I just wanted to go back to um this kind of shart so you can see you have the shart and you have the percentage of gross and this is a different um this is different axis so how to do that this is very very important graph I'm using a lot let's go back to my uh Excel where is my Excel no here we go this is my Excel and I want to also display what will be the percentage of gross um I'm going to it like this grow I'm going to add this into the chart select data add the Ser name is this and the value is percentage great I press okay I know you can see H I don't see really this uh uh this this value because why the value is very low is like we are comparing two 4 million versus 5% that's why you don't see anything so how to change that you just right click you do change the chart type and then you go to combo then in the combo you can see oh you can change the type and you can also say secondary axis going to press here and now we can see so for the first two are on line and for the third one I like like this this is the way I like so you can really select what you like but the most important is to have a different axis you press okay and now you say oh okay now this is a bit better but I don't like because my um these bars are way too high I don't see my curve so what you're going to do now you're going to double click on the right then you're going to go to AIS option and the maximum is automatic but I don't want automatic I want a bigger number so 0.2 So 20% Then I will have it will take less space and it will be more visible you can also change the color if you like so that's the kind of trick I like and it's very visible and now you can also if you like add the data label label tck and that's something you say okay this is my Target and this is my target per month that will be nice and what we're going to do in the next episod it's always the same Target which doesn't make a lot of sense I'm going to explain to you why because you are for example in 2022 yeah you were growing by 20% in July and August so it will be very difficult to still grow but for example at the beginning of the year you did min-2 and - 12 you will have more room to grow next year and so that's why we're going to start spreading the forecast and per month to have like a more relevant forecast and not to raise the same Target every month
okay so now let's talk about seasonal forecast not the fix one plus 5% every every month but this time we're going to do something more like accurate I would say based on the seasonality of your business so what we're going to do we're going to we're going to create what we call a basis 100 like this is BAS or B basis and we're going to B this 100 and we're going to app play we're going to create um monthly seasonality for the business to be able to spread the annual forecast all right you're ready let's get into it so if I go back to my previous file where is the file we're going to do that so I'm going to get back to I can use this pivot table I'm going to remove my year into filters yes and what I'm going to do now you can see we have the sum of sales per year so you could do I'm going to do contrl Z you could do also the idea is really to see what is the trend of January February per month so you could do equal sum of every year every row or you can do the you could do the average will be the same but you know what you don't even have to do that and we're going to do much more exercise per segment later we have a full chapter talking about season but I wanted to introduce just the the macro seasonality of the business and then we're going to get back into it B later so if I'm going tooo fast it's okay we're going to get back to that so I'm going to moove I can see per detail you could do the same like this right or I can remove this and just remove the details up and you see I have the exact same number 11 Millions so now I have this great and I want to create what we call a a seasonality basis 100 why 100 because it's not easy when I do this graph in set this is the kind of shape this shape is basically the average of the shape of all the year what is interesting you could for example remove 2020 which was a big mess to say no I don't want to have 2020 and you can see that the shape is not as strong in May and June because the pandemic was very strong in April May andun so also be aware that you can remove some specific don't use the incomplete y if I'm using 2023 will it will not have a it will impact in the wrong way so always use full year for your seasonality and may me remove this one and that will be that will be the the shape I would like to have for my annual for but the problem this is in dollar so how do you connect 50 like 45 million forast to this number it's not easy that's why we're going to transform this into what we call basis 100 in percentage that we can then spread the forecast so how do we do that it's very simple we're going to do equal we're going to take this value through of 46 no 45 to this value divided not by this total but by the average of every month great so now we have six 69 what is 69 69% basically January represents 69% of a normal month what is a normal month a normal month is a month doing 100% so that will be so this is wrong I need to have a problem because I didn't fro my formula F4 F4 there we go now we have this you see we have the exact same color but this time we have numbers and the most when I do the average of this I see average 12.8 Millions so 12.8 million is the average month so this one for example 99 is very close to what is my average month during the year it's 12 million so there will be this value on this graph you know this value okay and I want to now that I have this I want to have what would be my sales Target sales Target using this percentage you can see once again I repeat if you add 2020 you will have different numbers May will be the stronger month if I remove this year the biggest month is not July so be very careful when you have and most of most most of you had a big trouble during this pandemic in a good way or in a bad way try to remove uh this uh specific moment in your seasonality uh that's why it's better to have more than two or three years hisory if you want to clean all of this so now what is my Sal Target I wanted do I'm going to go back to my annual Target the goal is to spread the annual Target 45 minutes great I want to do 45 milon now it's very simple I'm going to spread this going to zoom I'm going to do equal 45 I'm going to log the formula times the percentage ta so we say oh but what is 31 million why because you need to divide this value by 12 because you have 12 periods so you need to divide by 12 if you do this per week you have to divide by 52 so now I have 2.5 million nice I'm going to spread this and if I check I have 45 Ms total great that was my target per month and now let's create another graph insert and know this is my new annual Target that I spread Target 2023 monthly this one is much more advanced as you can see you don't have the same Pig this one is a bit like I would say smooth in the way and what I want to see now is the gross per month that's the last step so I'm going to remove this one one what would be the gross per month I'm going to do uh forecast growth and we're going to divide this value by u5 u5 nice minus one oops minus one and we do have the annual not annual the monthly forecast sorry and you can see that we have very different numbers from the plus 5% every every year if I go back to this and then we have plus 5% we have we have a big variation December we're going to do plus 19 plus 10 in January but in July and August we plan to have negative grow because last year keep in mind we did plus 18 and plus 19% okay so it's very interesting to do this this way now I'm going to now you can pause the video and I'm going ask you to add the growth in percentage in this graph with another axis so pause this video and try to do the same layout to see the these columns with the gross per month okay good you've done it I hope you've done it select data this one is called say Target and we add another one add Focus grow we do like this and now we do format data series you can also sometimes if you go here you can see there is secondary axis ho that's another way to do it but I don't like the format so for this you have to right click change series chart type to colon I know we have this super happy and you can see that there is a very different Target per mon which is very important because if you don't have the right target per mon it could be like very like depressing for your team to say you know what this month is impossible to reach oh this one is too easy uh so I really recommend you to think about first what will be the annual forecast with multiple methal with market share with um I'm going to go back to this one up oh where is my graph so we had multiple method to First the it could be the intuition method it could be the market share method it could be the risk and opportun opportunity method and then how to spread your forecast annually and then monthly using seasonality and we're going to go back to seasonality in a in later chapter not only Global but per segment and in the next episode as well we're going to talk about or to forecast not only Global but per category and subcategory
in the previous episode we did micro annual forecast we were always doing a top analysis you know like from the market from the the global level and then we spread this forecast into monthly forecast we did like the flat one we did the seasonal one but now let's do another way let's do the bottom up forecast not from the product level but from the subcategory and category level because what what my for example my CFO was telling me in the previous chapter is the like you can have different Trends per Market or per segment and it's good to know what would be the trend and then you can sum the trend of different segments you could say Okay instead of doing the top one I'm going to do the category and if I have six categories I'm going to do the sum of these categories for my Global Focus so that's what we're going to do now we're going to analyze first and then we're going to we're going to talk about how to get different forus per category okay so let's go back to the file that's the file this file I'm going to go back to one of my pivot table what I can just copy one that I like for example this one up going to the right T so I would like to see where is my P table I didn't copy properly I need to copy with this so I didn't copy the pivot table because the filter was missing okay now I have a pivot table and I want to see per category like this oh interesting so I'm going to copy this one remove this oops like this and what I want to see now I want to change the design of course always and what I want to do I want to see the graph so what I can see in the I can't see much in the graph right this is not the way I want so I want to invert so what we're going to do we're going to do right click select data we're going to switch row and colon okay nice design okay so I recommend to do your own analysis as well you can even pause the video to explore this data set what is interesting what can you see you can see there is a very strong category called electric bikes this one is growing super fast from less than 5 Millions to something like 12 or 13 million so it was interesting because there was very similar to the this Market uh this market share study that was seeing that ebac agreeing very fast between 2020 and 21 but even before you can see in this specific company that the market is growing very fast for mountain bike yes we had a big Peck in 2020 but then he going back to I would say normal same for road bike I don't see much about the other one so let's you know what let's remove the big ones like this I know you can see the other one because they're smaller you can also change the axis if you want to have a secondary axis and you can see okay access S pretty flat um kid bikes huge Peck in uh during the pandemic closing are pretty fast pretty small and not growing very fast but there is a new collection coming we're going to talk about it and BM MX is declining if we only select this one we can see that they declining really really strong and Walmart is not doing to take the collection next year so he's going to deine even more that's why we're talking about in the risk where is the in the risk and opportunity in this tab in my file that Walmart was out we're not selling our products next year so the trend is not good it was not good already but it's even worse when we look at the different numbers okay so I really recommend you to uh to deep into all these categories and even subcategories so now let's go back to this and do subcategories I'm going to go back to my pivotable analy my field list and I'm going to add subcategories clack so now we have way too many NOS it's a bit complicated to see what's going on so I recommend to do it maybe for just one or two category for example electric bike you can see oh okay we have a we can see that the sil bike is growing faster than the mountain bike you can see there is a small decline on this one but this one is growing even faster in 2022 so it's also the graphic analysis is very powerful I recommend to really have a look let's go back to for example mountain bike very similar let's go back to maybe accessories you can see like yeah it's pretty uh the biggest one is water bottle um and then it's helmet by the way if you want to change you want you can do it as well in quantity if you're curious you can see oh in quantity lights are pretty big but not in value because the average sales price is smaller that's why so you have all this analysis and I recommend really to play with that and to understand what are the different Trends and in the next episode we're going to start forecasting per subcategory to provide an annual forecast uh globally
okay my friends so now we're going to start focusing per subcategory that's what we're going to do now we're going to do this table then this table with the gross let's get into it let's go back to this file design let's do it blue blue blue clack so I want to do the subcategory as well so you can see because I have another one you should never do that you should always have one one pivot table per sheet make some space and see if it's working now subcategory okay so now we have all this category great I'm going to sort by value descending sum of sales T we can see the biggest one mountain bikes then Rod bikes I mean it was the biggest one now but not in the last year and in the last year electric bik is the biggest one interesting just to show you as well you could switch the sales by percentage of sales value field setting show value as and you can use percentage of ground total so that's that will give you percentage I like to pre I prefer to have the one if I go back not ground total but of colon total then you will have each year what will be the repartition for example oh interesting you can see the market share inside the company of mon bik move from 36 to 29 when electric bike move from 12% to 20 almost 30% so I I like also this Vision to see what what is the the gross and the the decline of every category inside your company you can see that BMX is moving from almost 4% to 2% and it's going to keep declining next year so it's also good to see what are the yeah what are the strategy what are the main grow I'm going to switch back to Value but I wanted to show you this example as well it's a good way to see the the value okay so I'm going back to show value as no calculation and now what we're going to do we're going to do the percentage of grow again we're going to do ah two I always do like this then I don't have to if I change all my template Everything Will Change automatically my friend T I remove this one and we're going to do again AI divided by HH 3 minus one percentage can copy this like this there we go some colors conditional formatting nice we do have this I recommend also to add maybe some uh you know like I'm holding control button to make it more visible for the total then contrl B for bold or bold here and then like this now it's easier to to see what's going on and then we're going to say okay what will be the 2023 targets right well what what would be the the right value for that so I'm going to give you just one example you could do it by category or by subcategory and then we're going to Recon reconsolidate to the total this let's say for example mountain bike Mountain Bike plus one - 57 - 26 -4 and you say you know what this year uh you you will have probably a meeting with sales or marketing or you will have new PR coming or you will have like you can see that the trends are coming back and you say you know what this here we're going to go to 10% so this number is Rec coming from the more you will have information and Analysis in the company the more you will know we're going to do later forecast per product that's going to be we're going to also check the trend per category we're going to do all of this later but I just want to keep it very micro for now but I had a chat with with marketing or with my and say you know what this year our goal is to do by grow by 10% with the mountain bike woman who are checking with the market and uh the perspective are not great so we don't we forecast a decline of 5% for this year so you could have all this consensus meeting to Define per sub category with a lot of analysis you could do the same analysis what we did before with for example risk I'm going to go back to this file you know this risk what is the organic forecast what what are all the opportunities what are the risk you could do all of these per category or per subcategory if you have a very big company that's the way I feel you should work you should also compare what will be the market Trend not for the global but for the category and basically everything I did at the global level you the biggest is your company uh the more you should get into details for new products for sales distribution for promotions for marketing exposure etc etc I won't spend 10 hours to do that because I want to keep it simple for you guys but that's the way you should uh you should work uh if you want to to have more accurate forecast even at the global level so let's let's say okay we get this number with all this analysis and now I want to have my overall forecast what would be the overall forecast for mountain bike if I don't have because I don't forecast this one I forgot the subcategory it's very simple I'm going to do this one in value then I'm going to go okay plus 10% easy so we're going to do Al four times not four times one plus 10% and now we have this number if you want to grow by 10% you just have to add 10% versus last year you do the same for this one we are declining so we're going to do 5 million instead of 5.3 million and then if you want the category growth easy you're going to do equal this plus this nice and if you want to add you go you're going to do the opposite so you can add this divided by al3 minus one minus one great I know by getting 10% on mountain bike men and minus 5% on mountainback women you will have 4% gross on this category okay so that's the way we do it this time we're not doing top down we're doing bottom up we are going from the subcategory to the category and we get plus 4% and 12 Millions so I'm not going to do all the category it will be a lot of uh details not necessary details that's the way I like to work as well that's another way and I did it for all the category for example if you see accessories we had a specific forast sometimes you know it's very like clear okay folder you can have very ambitious forecast folder we're going to push a lot with marketing plus 100% so at the end we're going to do $3,000 instead of 15,000 and this this information you can get it from the person and the department who knows better the market and can give you more accurate information at the end what will be the overall forecast for the total you will do simply the sum of all your category and every category is the sum of all the subcategory and you will have the number of 44.9 millions which is very close to 45 Millions sometimes we also do this exercise to get close to the micro forecast we try to to find how we could fill the Gap and sometime we say you know what we have to push more the electric bike because otherwise we are not making our Target maybe the initial Target was 10% but if you do 10% we are missing almost 1 million value in this specific category so that's also a very powerful way to sim to do simulation of what would be the impact overall on my forecast and then we are very close to the same one we have 5.5% growth 45 Millions but this time we use from subcategory to category so I hope this is clear this is just an overview of what we're going to do um later not globally but per per segment but also per product of course you could also spread the forecast of for example okay mountain bike men this is 7.8 million what will be the forecast per month for this specific category to be honest for many case you don't need to have an annual forecast per category unless you have specific team or bonus uh but what we're going to do in the next chapters not this one we're going to spread this seasonality not only at the macro but at the micro level per category and per subcategory to have all this analysis and we're going to use this seasonality to forus our products but this is just an introduction and what we're going to do and I wanted to talk about this micro forecast because this is very important and this one will give you the guideline and the direction to to forecast and also to to align all your departments into One Direction I just add another one on the right just for fun we're going to talk about this one in um how to forecast with automatic formulas for example but I just asked to excel to give me the automatic forecast for next year using this specific formula it's called forecast ETS and I got a minus 7% next year so Excel is not very confident about the growth for next year let's let's talk about it later with multipos way this is a triple exponential smoothing uh but it's a bit too early and I hope you enjoy this chapter and in the next chapter we're going to go deeper into different model of forecasting
okay my friends so now in this new chapter we're going to talk about how to choose the right forecasting model the right formula and I I invited again my friend Mario to talk about it he's the expert and we're going to talk all to how to choose but I'm not a mathematician and yes Mario you did a lot of degrees and research in mathematics and that's a question for many people is do you need to be a data scientist or mathematician to have the right formula and to find it what do you think Mayo no I don't think I don't think you do have to be a mathematician um especially if what you're trying to forecast is not that complicated okay uh so a simple moving average or yeah you will go a bit more into details but yeah just simple formulas can actually can actually work it be so much better than nothing so yeah definitely you don't have to and to be honest as well you don't need to understand the formula you just have to like my pedagogy is to uh if you know the way work and that's what we're going to do you just repeat what I'm doing but you don't need to understand all the mathematics for example for triple exponential smoothing why he was invented and at school in France we had to learn all the why behind the formula but you don't have to get you don't have to read a book of 500 pages to apply sometimes you just have to repeat right and it's yeah it's it's it's more and more the case you know the more complicated the algorithm uh the less people know about it and when you get to machine learning it's a black box nobody knows not even the that scientist who who program the model um so yeah just what you said that's a good example and when we were asking we did a lot of survey about what kind of forecasting method do you use and maybe you joined our our previous webinar together but it was we had a lot of people or not having any forecast I think that was the big part of it or having a very manual or intuition forast that can be good we did a lot of intuition forecast for the mcro financial forecast uh moving average and then with had people using exponential smoothing or machine learning the 15% was not really it was on LinkedIn but when we did it on the webinar it was more three or 4% than 15% uh so a lot of people are talking about it but not a lot of people are using it today and the question I have for you may know what is the best forecasting model what is the best formula of course I have I'm biased so I have to tell you machine learning um it's a latest technology it works very well uh with some cats okay two massive ones uh first of all you have to select the right inputs for the model and having too many um it's it's it's not always a good thing so you have to select carefully the right ones and then the the second uh big point you have to be careful is the tuning of the model so it has to be done by people who are expert in the field and know exactly what they're doing to get really really accurate forecast otherwise the risk what what is the risk the risk is that the the the model is gonna sometimes gonna give you some results that don't make any sense okay some really really big forecast or some really really low forecast you don't know why and yeah it's it basally ends up being less accurate than a simple moving average yeah so I think that was the what we're explaining is like there is there is a level of maturity that you need to have to use this Advanced model and if you never done any forecast in your life and you you go back to the most advanced machine learning tool you may crash and I like to use the formula one example if you never if you never drive a car ever in your life and you start going into a Formula One maybe you don't even know how to start the engine that's the first step and you're going to probably go too fast and crash at the first uh turn and I think that's the same for forecasting there is a level of complexity and there is a level of accuracy and if you do if you go at the right pace yes you're going to improve but I can tell you you improve much faster at the beginning when you move from n having forecast to implementing an automatic very simple formula then when you move from I don't know for machine learning from three layers to four layers of neuron neuron Network maybe maybe we we going to talk about it later but be very careful and the idea of this method for casting exper is not to go straight to the Formula One Is to go step by step and if you feel ready we're going to tell you how to go deeper and we're going to talk about this later now when we talk about the different models uh there is there is an evolution between accuracy and complexity the first level is no forecasting at all you have zero forecast and yeah and do you have a lot of compan because they don't have forecast they don't know what to do it they don't have the time or maybe they don't need forecast if for example you wait for your the orders of your customers to produce something maybe you don't need forecast for that unless you have to buy your components in advance then we move to na forecast na forecast are really basic you're going to go okay I'm going to take the same value than last month all the same value than last year that's a very common forecast and I think that the most common forecast then you're going to move you know what I'm going to do a moving average I'm going to do the last two or three months forecast uh from the past or maybe last six months so last 12 months I'm going to give you more example in Excel after then you say you say you know what I feel there is a seasonality happening so maybe we're going to add a seasonality or there is a trend going up or down so we're going to add Trends and then you going to start to enrich we're going to add forecast adding value you're going to start adding more external or internal um information such as commercial inputs uh there is a promotion coming there is a you will have a new exposure on Amazon websit you going have more traction or multi dimensional factors are we going to maybe you going to implement I don't know the price the weather forecast or more more advanced model but the more you will go to this direction the more you will have complexity and for example you were talking about the price or the weather forecast I tried to when I was working with the MIT I tried to implement the weather forecast into the forecasting model and it was on the paper it looks great yeah it's going to be sunny we're going to sell more summer product but on the on the reality what does it mean hot what does it mean hot is it 20 degrees or I don't know for Fahrenheit but what 100 Fahrenheits 100 Fahrenheits is it 120 Fahrenheits uh we don't know because for in Brazil when I it was 20 it was cold and in in France when it was 20 degrees it was hot so the correlation and the data point and we are missing a lot of data because we need the data point per region per store Etc he was a mess and at the end we crash and it was even worse than just doing a moving average then the last step is last step is machine learning but that you need to be ready and most of the company today are not ready for that but we're going to go step by step to go to push you from a very basic level to uh from a professional and expert level but we wanted to start with that we're going to focus first from the easy and simple formula and and surely we're going to move you to a higher level of maturity and I one point you will have to decide I think yeah if I move from zero maybe I'm going to get most of my um increase and performance just by statistical forecast and if I'm already at this point maybe we're going to move to a more advanced model
so we could see with my friend Mayo there is no one best solution unless you are your Amazon and you are already using the super smart and automatic machine learning the question now is how to choose the right fusing model based on your level of maturity and the complexity you ready uh to start so I was explaining before with my friend like from no fusing to machine learning there is a big huge room to to Improvement uh and you can really start very simple to naive to statistical to include more models and factors and information that will improve your accuracy but also the level of complexity and for me the best advice I can tell you and that's what we're going to do just after in Excel is just to start forecasting in the simplest way possible then to measure and analyze and improve your model each time you get better so for example I'm going to go back to the foundation of forecasting for me you have three level three three uh pillars in your forecast in your especially on your in your statistical forecast you have the level the level is like how many what would be your your level of how many products would you sell per week or per month like 100 per week or 100 per month that will give you like what is the level of sale then what is the trend of your product or your company of your the consumption of your raw material could be you are growing you are not growing you are declining we we're going to see for example the BMX BMX bicycle are declining so the trend is negative and then you do have Cycles Cycles are moving up and down and you need to Define these Cycles once you really understand these three composition of your forecast then you can combine them to create your own forecast sometimes you don't even have seasonality sometimes your trend is really flat we're going to go back to very simple example also like very intermittent produ with very low volumes but that's the way I will start I will start to make sure that you try to explore these three pillars and then in the future we're going to see how to add commercial for example inputs such as promotions like events that will impact your Baseline forecast to have your final forecast it could be price reduction promotion you could you could change the dispos the disposition of your product in your stores or maybe you have new distribution Network that will increase the number of quantity that you're going to sell and at the end once you have your forecast you're going to start tracking the errow okay what happened and what was my forecast what is the the accuracy or the error of my forecast and then you're going to start digging say but where where this Gap is coming from is it coming from the trend the seasonality or maybe the level and in this specific case we say oh you know what we had some stock C in the past so we're going to correct that and we're going to go back to step number four and we're going to repeat this loop again and again forecasting measuring analyzing improving so that's really what you have to understand don't look for the perfect formula immediately don't go directly to very Advanced for forecasting Model start simple and improve step by step to uh to go to the right direction and that's what I did for the last 15 years like like my friend Mario at the end the conclusion is the best forecasting model is the one that provides the best accuracy not not one specifically but it's also given the maturity of your processes so I'm going to repeat this multiple times and many people ask me Ed what is the best model between triple exponential smoothing arima or profit and then you should not ask this question you just try yourself try the accuracy and then see the one with the best performance and if you don't know how to do it that's what we're going to do in the next episode we're going to go from very simple models with like a maybe a better poor Focus accuracy we're going to try to improve the complexity and also the focus maturity process but maybe you will see sometimes we're going to crash because it will be more complex but not as efficient and simple models as well so that's what we're going to do and don't forget as well to visualize your forecast I feel the best way to learn also the behaviors and the the of your of your models of your forecasting model is really to observe in the graph what is the what is the behavior of this forecast of different forecast so that's what we're going to do I feel that in this EIP system or even Excel spreadsheet I don't see enough visual and graphic analysis I use this a lot with my team to train them to make them more sensitive and more like to develop this intuition about what would be the best for casing model and that's also what we're going to do just after
okay so now let's start uh with this Excel file you can download this Excel file Below on up the video I don't know exactly where but you're going to find it this is another file uh we're going to practice a lot we're going to the idea is really to compare like 10 different models for cusing model that we're going to go step by step and see which one is the most accurate right but to know which one is the most accurate we're going to see multiple products I'm going to get back to this after like like low sales High sales global company even Apple forecast to forecast the revenue of the the Apple company but before that we need to talk about forecast accuracy right because you cannot improve what you cannot measure and I want to go back to this topic which is very very important so accuracy maybe you if you follow my other course SM analytics you already know about it or maybe I did also a small tutorials in YouTube but I wanted to go back to uh how does it work like simply to track your accuracy because that's what we're going to use to improve and check our models this is a very simple example you have 10 products Nike and Adidas what you need to get you need to get the forecast that you did before so in this specific case it was one week before it could be one month before I'm going to go back to more advanced forecast accuracy horizon or lead time after in the review process chapter but I just wanted to keep it simple you have the forecast you did and you you have the demand the demand could be the sales the consumption you could also correct if you have all of stock but we're going to get back to this as well later so you have the forecast any of the demand and the first thing you want to check okay what is the error so we have multiples way to track the accuracy but first of all let's keep it very simple I'm going to zoom you have the error and the error is just the difference between the demand and the forecast could do it in quantity or value that would be the same okay of course if you have very different products with like for example you are selling a plastic bag and like very expensive bikes I would recommend to do it in value to avoid this like a gap of value and don't Focus because then I like to focus my energy in gap in value not in quantity uh because at the end the goal is to deliver more value to the customers but if you work in manufacturing maybe you prefer to do it in quantity because every piece of your car is as important if you don't have even the smallest one you will you won't be able to finish your your manufacturing process so this is up to you you can do both in my specific case we're going to use value and we're going to also use quantity when you you work product by product you can also use quantity so we have this uh forecast and we have this demon and we just do the difference between demand and focus right perfect and then you do like this I don't have have the same result interesting oh yeah know I have the same result so demand and forecast and then if you want to change just to let you know the conditional formatting we did before is just this one okay okay and then what do we going to do we're going to do okay this is my error per product and what is the what is the percentage of error we're going to go back to this one after it's just the difference between my my error and my demon the problem is when you divide your ER by the demand like this right you will have first you will have a problem with divided by zero if you don't have theand and you will have negative value as well but at the end when we want to calculate the error you don't really care about if it's above or below you want to have the absolute value that's why we're going to use what we call the absolute error so the absolute error is just to say that we don't we want to remove all the negative uh all the negative uh values so this one is okay but this one will become plus 100 and this one minus 50 will become 50 and then when we do the error we always check with the absolute error like this so This divided by the demand now I have my error 0% error because this is exactly the same I want to go down like this up let me check my absolute error divided by my demand and and in this specific case there is no demand so we're going to add this formula if error then we just put zero oh no 100% if there is an error up one like this CL okay so now we have uh I just said because you cannot divide by Z you have 0 30% 100% so this is the percentage of error for one product if you want to talk about accuracy you just have to do it's just the opposite so some people some people and Company use error and other accuracy I like to talk about accuracy because I feel it's more positive and it's always like U it's always like uh it's impossible to get 100% of ACC accuracy so I think it's more positive to talk this way for for myself is like you could talk about stock out percentage of stock out or percentage of availability I prefer to to be a positive person in this world of stress and C sometimes so accuracy is very simple is just one minus the error just above like this okay so you just do like this you have the error you have the accuracy so this is great per product but what do you do if you have multiple perod like you have one item for two years or you have multiple products you have 10 products like this one for that you have four different methods to try the accuracy and that's what we're going to check right now the first one is what we call the b bs the BS is this formula you're going to divide your total error you don't even check the the absolute you're going to say okay you know what I'm going to do the sum of all my error positive and negative so they will like kind of kind of neutralize each other like this one will neutralize with the positive one this one and this one for example and at the end the total isus $20 so minus $20 you're going to divide - $20 by the total of your demon the total of your is 1250 so you you do that and this is what we call OBS what does it mean minus 2% minus 2% means like in the in the overall on your 10 products you are minus 2% below the total demand so you are just below and that's what we call the BS is this kind of Target that you probably seen at your school engineering school or sulation school if you have a master degree uh this is just to like a when we do archery just have an idea if you tend to over forecast or under forecast like this one for example you will you will tend to be always below the the Target or in average and this one you will be like or this one you will be above uh the the forecast all the time okay so that's just to give you an idea if you are below or above it's very useful for example if you buy products with your forecast accuracy and you say oh like overall with my BS I'm I'm below so I tend to buy not enough compared to the total demand and if I'm above I tend to have way too much inventory for my products so you just have to be this one is very useful but it's not I would say it's complementary why because you don't really know the the quality of your forecast you could have like huge variation you could have like for example minus 10,000 and plus 10,000 oop like this at the end you say oh great you only have one person error but you have two huge massive Gap in your eror so that's why at the end for me this is not the real accuracy this is just Trend to say if you're above or below then we have other so I recommend to use this one as a an indicator like complimentary but not the main one then we have another method called the map the map is mean absolute percentage error and this one when you look at it you're going to do the average of all your error so it could be interesting you say yeah it makes sense yeah you do like this my average is 39% 39% is my result and my accuracy is 1 - 30 39 so 61% I don't recommend this one why because if if you have almost the same demand for your product this is okay but if you don't have the same demand for example let's say that this product I'm going to change the demand to for example 10,000 or 100,000 you you see like at the end you will say okay your error is 47% because it will not it will just this product has less not more important than the other ones so when I do like this I say okay there is one very bad but this one is as important as this one with only you have $100 error in this one and you have 100,000 in this one and they have the same weight in your calculation that's why I don't recommend this method because I feel this is not relevant I recommend to use always the mean while we the mean absolute error the mean absolute deviation this is exactly the same and at the end the what what do we do this time we're going to divide not the sum of your error but the sum of your absolute error so we do the sum of your absolute error that we divide by the total of the demand so instead of dividing minus 20 by by D we're going to divide by 420 we're going to do all the errors with the positive sign and this time we have 30 34% of accur error or 66% of accuracy okay so this is almost the same the situation if I go back to my example with like a big gap like this you will see that my this time like my accuracy was 53 and on the other one because there is no weight for per product but when we consider the weight I only have 1% of accuracy or 99% of error so I hope you understand the difference between these two that will prevent you to have this massive a massive Gap that you that won't be visible in your forecast accuracy and at the end you want to improve whatever it's in quantity or value you want to improve the overall accuracy of all your products that's why I always recommend this method this method can also be called WAP like this is the weighted average percentage error okay so this is the same that M AE then the last one is called R Ms root means square error and this one is used for data science and machine learning this is much more complex the formula if you look at the formula this is the square root of the average of your error multiply by the error like we just do a square square error like this one multiply by this one so we we're going to multiply this one in this formula so if I go back to the formula average of the arrow Square arrrow divided by the average of of your demand and we do the square root of the first one of this one very complex right why this is uh interesting this is interesting because at the end when you multiply the Arrow by by the arrow you do the square of the arrow at the end you're going to amplify the biggest outlier the biggest mistakes right so for example this one you have $100 error you're going to at the end if you multiply 100 by 100 you have 10,000 and this method will basically minimize the we try to minimize the biggest mistakes like this one so it will amplify the biggest error in your forast program so I like it if you really do like Advan like data science or foring implementation the problem is is very difficult to explain so if you use this Capi with your B of director and they ask you the what is the what is the formula then it's going to be very complex to explain even for me it's complex to explain to you so I would not recommend to use this one unless you do like python or machine learning and no one is really checking what is the value and the goal at the end is not very very comparable 34 and 40 the goal is always to reduce the error or improve the accuracy and that's what we're going to do in the next episode so the conclusion at the end is this is like if you want Simplicity I recommend to use the Mae the ma for the Simplicity the valuating and I will also do the BS to see if you are overall overcasting or under forecasting there is no error rating that mean that we are not amplifying the the worst error but I think this is the best way to to do and to for to work for 99% of you 99% of you and I do not recommend this one but this one could be interesting uh if you have more advanced model so now in the next episode we're going to use the what we call the mean absolute error we're going to try to develop different forecasts and see what is the best one which one provide the best accuracy
okay my friends so now let's start forecasting seriously in Excel so in this file as you can see we have I iws I Will Survive Global then we're going to do a automatic formula we're going to check like different products electric bike like top sales one low low sales High sales very very slow movers and see what are what are the best formula to work with and then also an exercise with the Apple Revenue so our are we going to do that let's go back to go back to iws Global the first thing you need to get the data right you need to have information we're going to focus first Revenue in dollars and then we're going to focus quantity so what do I get in this file if you zoom in iws global we have the date and the revenue so we do the date and the revenue and we have only until June and if you do like this I just hold control and shift down ins set this is the chart I have for this company right so we we were checking this one in the financial forecast you can add it black like this and I want to forus I want to forecast the next six I want to forus the next 12 months but the goal of this module is not to forecast the future but is to find the right model right to really understand what are the different models that we can use to uh to improve the forecast accuracy so the first thing you need to do this is your debt and your Revenue I recommend to always include what we call the the period like this period and always to start with the first number like the first period with one you do one like this and then you do equal one plus one why because we we are talking about what we call Time series and for time series we need to to understand we need to make understand the Future model what what is the time series how many points do you you have and what is what are the sequency of this point if you use the DAT you can have some confusion with the format so I always recommend to do that and then you go like this and you have the period from one to 66 and then you can include more periods if you want to focus in the future so this is the first thing is like to really identify the time series with the right period format and the right the right format is 1 2 3 4 5 etc etc okay then we're going to talk talk about months later when we talk about seasonality we're going to use it for seasonality but for now this is enough the second step is to Define okay what is your training data data set and what is your uh testing data set all right so because we cannot I could forecast the future but if I forecast the future I won't be able to to check if I go back here up if I forecast the future I will have to wait another 6 months or one year to know if my focus is better or not so what we need to to Define is okay you know what I'm going to fake I'm going to pretend we are not in 20123 uh June but we are before right we are maybe one 6 months one year before and then I'm going to recheck my forecast with the data I have in the in the fake future so you you going to ask me okay should I should I check my forecast on everything maybe on the one year two years and that's a very good question so the split could be a very scientific approach as well how many uh Which percentage should be uh used as testing and which part should be used as as training because if you use all your data set to test you won't have enough history to generate an accurate forecast because you won't see any seasonality if you start your forecast here you have only this piece you don't know oh you don't know you get you can see this seasonal trend for example so what we're going to do is we're going to split into two parts and I would say that the most classic way is to use 80% or 90% of your data set as a training and 10 to 20% as testing and that's what we're going to do we have 66 period in the past if you use 10 person you have six period if you use 20 person you have uh 12 13 period so what what I like is I'm going to use 12 months as a testing because it's a full year it's a full cycle and we know that this company as a seasonality cycle so what we're going to do is say you know what the last 12 months I'm going to use them as Cy as a testing and we're going to start forecasting not the forecast from this period because we don't have any story but from one year before and the idea what we're going to do in the next episode we're going to start forecasting and compare if this forecast is better than the results we had uh in the last 12 months okay so I hope this is clear so you can have a different colors for this you just change a color and you say okay now we have we have our training and we're going to use this data to train the model and to prepare the model and we're going to use this data to check if which one is the more accurate forecast
okay so in the previous episode we were preparing the the data between testing splitting testing and training that's what we did very very simply we took the last 12 months we say okay we're going to test on this specific Revenue now what we're going to do we're going to start forecasting one and and tracking the error so we're going to start with a very very basic very basic formula which is the naive forecast the most simple one the naive forecast is very simple do equal the last period you know so you do like this great and you just because you don't know the next one so you do like this F4 you lock the formula and this is always the same value great very simple now now let's see how it looks select data we're going to add another one the Ser name is naive always use the dynamic like this don't write down naive here and then we're going to select from the beginning up also extended the forecast after my period just to to see how it looks but this is exactly the same okay and now we have our first forus congratulation oh very important you have to practice with me if you don't if you just watch me you're going to lose your time very important that you really practice with me we're going to press the plus do the graph as well with me clack Legion yes and I want the legion below at the bottom yes because we will have too many great so now we have the revenue and we have on a forecast what do you think of this forecast what do you think you think it's accurate looks like we miss a big part of it and what I can do as well I can also extend my Revenue to this CL so we we we're going to try we're going to check the accuracy of this but just also for information that will be the forecast for the if you want to forast as well in the future just just for your information so what is what is the accuracy of this this is very simple we're going to go on the right and you can see on the right we have I I created the same block with the same models and just press equal equal naive so the naive one is here and I'm going down and I'm just checking the error like we did before you remember for the focus accuracy I just need to compare uh my error is my Demand versus my forecast and then we're going to do the absolute after so we're going to do the same but this time we have 12 periods we're going to compare naive minus my Revenue so I'm going to do it again just to make sure it's clear for you my forecast minus this one and I'm going to just lock the colon the Colon D to make sure that we keep we always compare this one for the other models okay so we do like this and then I just go like this and I have this is my accuracy so the total I have 7 million of uh error but this is not my accuracy this is the BS what is the BS just to keep in mind this is the sum of my error 7 million divided by the sum of all my Revenue during the same period it could be quantity Revenue consumption whatever at the end 7 million I'm 7 million above my Revenue which is 177% above and you can see like if you compare only this period we're only comparing this area for the accuracy you can see that I'm not in the in the middle I'm above so I'm 17% above that the global forecast which is basically the yeah it's too much but what I want to know is not only the the BS what we learn before is the what is the accuracy and the accuracy I just did the same so you have the block for BS and you have the block for mean average error and for this one what we do we just do the absolute value of if each of my error the absolute value of this one is going to be positive and what we do at the end we do this we do all absolute error and we do the sum of all this error 11 millions and then we just apply the same formula my error will be the sum of my absolute error divided by the sum of my Revenue okay so we do like this and we have an error of 27.5% and the accuracy is 1 minus this one oops equal 1 minus this one and we have 72.5% of accuracy so this is the accuracy of this model for this specific period that we decided 72.5% and now what we're going to try is is to find another model which provide another better accuracy you can already check you can see that we're going to find better accuracy with other models but the the idea was really to understand how to prepare the data or to test one and then we're going to go much faster to to test different models with different accuracy just to let you know as well I calculated as well the what we call the root mean square error this one I was explaining before just here just for your information I'm not going going to use this one but just for your curiosity we will have we will have the same Trend and same behaviors between these two method at the end almost the same pattern unless you have massive difference with one specific data point okay so now let's go back to another episode we're going to try different method average average 12 months simple smoothing etc etc
okay so now let's continue we have everything to go much faster we're going to do now the what we call the moving average so moving average or moving average the first one we're going to use is the average for the last four years so we go back to this we do average and I want to do the last four years so something very very stable I'm going to do like this I'm going to go so four years will be no not from this from this I'm going to do 48 periods to have four years for 48 nice so I have my average for years and then I do equal because I don't know what's going to up in the past so it's always the same value and we're going to add this in the graph do it with me make sure average 4 years I'm going to select the same period up so what do you think it looks better now it looks a bit better better in the middle you know so that's what we're going to do and we're going to now do the same with the last only the last 12 months so instead of using the last four years we're going to use the last 12 months so I do average of the last 12 months uh I think I have 12 months let me check 12 you can see 12 row rows nice so now I have the 12 months we're going to check s name 12 months enter and we press okay okay okay so we have this graph and I can see I also have the graph the the shart in the past why because I just move my formula this average up 12 months or even this one uh you can copy the formula like this by formula TCH and this time I'm going to remove the the lock to have a moving average and you do like this up but it doesn't work here why because I don't have like if I want four years I don't have enough sorry so I'm going to do like this clack clack and I think this is the last one yes and I did the same for this one so you can see I'm moving the the moving average is moving last 12 months last 12 months up and I up to the last point where I can get 12 months of History so it's just interesting to see what is the behavior when you see in my graph the behavior of the so the four years we don't have much but you can see the behavior of the last 12 months and we can see that there is a massive impact with this peak during the pandemic and that's what we're going to clean in the next episode because maybe you don't want to have this in your it doesn't impack the last 12 months because the last 12 months doesn't affect this peak but if you want to use longer pattern let's say you want to use last two years you will have an impact with this peak which is not normal right so before that let's check the accuracy so I did the same formula uh to check what is the difference between the average four years the revenue and same for the 12 months the 12 months here up we do the difference between 12 months and revenue we have the absolute we can see that these two are very close in terms of what we call the Bas but when we look at the accuracy in terms of accuracy we can see that the average four years 6 16 76.9 and the 12 months is a bit better with 77.1 you can see we have already improved our accuracy by like some like five or six points just by using like a more advanced method which is the average but you can see that uh it's already a significant Improvement in terms of value we have improved that more than one one million almost $1 million not $2 million of accuracy which is a great Improvement and in the next episode we're going to see how to clean uh this pandemic Peck
okay so now in this episode we're going to talk about how to clean your outliers or sales history because sometimes you have something in the past that will probably do not happen in the future hopefully so this is the case of the the pandemia you can see that there was not a normal Peck and the problem if you we use or we generate forus Based on data historic but sometimes like the the history will not reflect the future and you want to to correct something that is not happening in the in the future again such as like you have a massive stock out or you had a crisis or you had maybe a massive change in your distribution like for example you lose a big customer that will not stay in the in the future so you should maybe remove also the sales of this customer in the past if you want to have more relevant forecast in the future right so that's what we're going to do here we're going to say you know what this PE I don't like it I don't like it it's not normal I think the norm the normality will have something similar to the year before so what you can do you can correct manually so this is the year 2020 you could correct manually one by one to say you know what this one I want to have 4 million I think this is right no not 44 you could correct manually and that will change the calculation of your forecast or you could also say something much easier say you know what I'm going to take the revenue of 2019 and I'm going to copy and paste value like this right click value boom I know this pig is the same than this one which looks much more like relevant what you could do as well you could say I I take 2019 plus two or three or 4% you could do like this this plus one or 2% I'm going to keep it this way because I think this is relevant enough and you can see that the pattern of my average 12 months change and also we have know a bigger difference between the average four years and the average 12 months this is your decision of course you can do it for one product or one company if you have to do it for 1,000 product there will be a different process that we're going to cover in uh the next uh chapters when we forus 500 different products but in this one you can do it manually and I think it's very important to to correct as well for the seasonality that we're going to see later and one once we go back now to the the accuracy of our product we can see that now the four years is forecasting below because he not using was kind of Faking the the the future because as you can see there is a trend to go up and the four years thanks to the peak during the pandemic was like artificially higher but not for the right reason so now if we go back to the for you can see that you are minus 11% for this one and in terms of accuracy the 12 months didn't change but the four years lost a bit of accuracy because of this change we did in the past but it will also improve the accuracy of the the model in the future that we're going to see in the next episode so don't forget to look at the past maybe use a graph to make sure that you have more accurate forecast in the future as well
this episode we're going to talk about simple exponential smoothing it's a it looks complex but the idea is really to keep it simple with you and if you don't understand the mathematics it's okay we just have to you just have to repeat what I'm doing if you look at just for your curiosity and Wikipedia exponential moving or exponential moving average you have the basic this is the formula you have the double one with the trend basically I don't like this kind of example and you have the triple W the triple one we keep it simple and that's why you join ABC chain is uh not for mathematics but to it really took me a while to to make sure that you don't waste your time and you only only focus on the on the results so the simple exponential smoothing is basically I'm going to keep try to keep it simple using like two parameters we call Alpha and beta and Alpha we use is the weight so you can see the sum is always equal to one you can also use 30% 70% Alpha will use if I look at my formula you're going to use 30% of your the latest value you know and the rest 70% for this calculation that is basically the calculation that you did here but just before so you're going to we're going to use an example and you will understand what is what are the difference we just have to apply the formula and then you will understand the difference the principle is to use a weight for the the closer you are to the your latest value this one the more you will give importance and weight to this uh to this value and you can Define this parameter 30 or 0.3 or 0.7 you can change the value you can say 0.5 I I'm going to teach you later how to use the solver Excel to optimize this value but you can see that when I change my accuracy is changing as well right so I'm going to go back to this one for example I'm going to move these two values control X next to this then you can see the results like this so this is my Alpha and beta just to let you know it looks very complex when I say Alpha and beta but this is okay stay with me so what are what are the the principle of the alpha and beta we're going to go back to this you have to start from the beginning simple exponential smoothy first your first value is equal to this one so because you don't know you don't have value before so you just say you know what I'm going to equal to this one then the second one it's very simple you're going to use okay I'm going to use the last Revenue I know or quantity or consumption times my Alpha I'm going to log with F4 log the formula Plus the latest calculation I did times beta and beta is 1 minus Alpha you know it's the sum is always equal to one great congratulation now you have this you have you see at the begin is the same and now you just do like this so I I forgot to lock my Beta this is I need to look this formula here this parameters I know I do like this up I do like this and you can see that there is an evolution of the value but you will understand by doing a graph so I just did this and then I did another one here and then I just say you know what because we don't have Revenue in the future so at the end I just say this one is equal to this one I have the same value because I don't know after what's happening now let's add this into to the graph and you will understand what does it mean so let's add simple exponential smoothing T enter okay so now was you was you can what you can see in the graph I'm going to change the color of my Revenue to White so the blue one is the simple exponential smoothing no let's play with this parameter you should do the the same to briers if I go to for example 0.9 you can see it will almost take let's take one just to keep it simple even better click when I do one here you will just say okay you know what one so I it was always it's like a KN forecast when I do one it's a KN for I say I only take the last value of the last period I know if I take 0.9 0.9 up it will start it will take 90% of my life value and the rest of my previous calculation using the same principle if I take 0.8 let go to 0.5 you can see or is telling less and less into account my latest value so more importance to the the past and less to the the Clause the Clause pass 0.3 oh no not this one 0.3 and let's do 0.1 0.1 is more like I would say more stable much more stable it will not overr with the latest value and 0.01 very flat you know like it will very it will it's all about the reactivity the higher is the alpha 0.9 the higher will be the reactivity to the latest value so that's the principle of exponential smoothing now let's go back for example to for example 0.5 and let's see what will what is the accuracy of this simple exponential smoothing 7 7 73.6 okay it's not great it was better with just the average last 12 months so what we're going to do now I'm going to move this one here the challenge of the exponential moving is to find what is the right value is the better accuracy if I go to 0.3 I'm getting better 75.7 right if I go to 0.2 I'm getting better 76 0.1 even better 0.05 doesn't work so now the challenge is okay but what is the best value you can do it manually but you could you could lose a lot of time or what we're going to do in the next episode we're going to find we're going to use the solver to solve this equation to say what what is the best Alpha value to have the better forecast accuracy
okay so in the last episode we were talking about the simple exponential smoothing but the problem was oh you know what I cannot optim I need to optimize manually this to find the right accuracy so now we're going to use the solver the Excel solver to optimize this number to use the solver the solver is in data and you can see solver here if you don't see the solver you have to install the solver so you go to file options you go to add in and need add in you go to manage Excel addin you press go and you have to check solver addin okay if you don't see this or maybe it's because you don't have the the same version that I do you just because we cannot provide a support for all the Excel version I'm using the latest one you just install solver Excel and then you add for example Office 2013 that's a very old one just check on Google you have you have tutorials on YouTube and you just YouTube or Google and you will find the the way to install it uh the server is present in Excel for the last 20 or 30 years so you will probably find your way okay so then you have the server and we want to optimize we want to optimize the alpha to improve your forecast accuracy of simple exponential smoothing okay so what we're going to do we're going to press solver I'm going to remove all of this because it was you do reset all okay what do I want to what is your goal your goal is to I want to optimize my accuracy simple exponential smoothing 75.7 so you select this one you could select the error that will be the same so I want to maximize this one if you select the r you will select minimum but this one is you want the highest accuracy as possible then you say by changing variable cells which one do you want to change I want to change my Alpha and when I'm going to change my Al is going to also change my Beta because there is a Formula between these two 1 minus Alpha great I know you need to have constraints what are the constraints like you don't want because the system is going to try every possibility if you don't say which one is the best one okay unless you select what we call the nonlinear it's going to is going to find the closest I'm going into more details but at the end it's better if you say you know why you should check Alpha from 0 to one because it's technically you should not you should always be between zero and one and you don't want Excel to try for example T the value of alpha about 10,000 for example or 20,000 it's going to completely block your computer because you're going to try too many different options which is not necessary so we're going to add constraint add we're going to say you know what Alpha has to be less than one less or equal and also add Alpha enter more than zero press okay and now we have this two we have minus than one more than zero I want to maximize my accuracy you can leave this normal and we're going to use this The evolutionary the this one is like if you don't know what the constraint you can use the nonlinear but I recommend this one if you have constraints okay just just repeat what I'm doing and then you press solve and what is is going to do you can see on the left is trying multiple Solutions so it's basically doing like me like okay Alpha 0.001 002 003 etc etc it may be a bit slow if you have a slow computer but it's just to give you an idea that he going to calculate for you it's going to try for you it's like kind for me it was the beginning of machine learning he going to multiply by a random number between zero and one and see what is the best result okay so I think this is a very useful tool for optimization I use it if you follow my Excel course for that's called Excel exper we use it for capacity optimization for inventory management as well and it's just going to give you the best result so solver for the solution perfect you just press okay and the best solution for the best accuracy is 0.09 interesting okay so at the End by doing this we have exactly the same result than the average 12 month that's the result of this so at the end you can see in the past but at the end what what is important is the last 12 months and we have this the same results between the 12 months I mean very very similar when you look at inv Value yeah it's it's the same exact same result interesting yeah it's the same result let me check if I'm not incorrect yeah we have the same result between these two so at the end the first conclusion would be but why should I use this complex formula when the average 12 months is very simple that's a very good question and we're going to check more uh formula in the future but you see that sometimes the complexity is not always the best in the next one we're going to talk about Trend linear forecast
in this episode now we're going to talk about what we call Trend linear forecast why because I can see that there is a trend in this graph right so what we're going to do first we're going to add a trend man like graphically in your in your chart so you select the revenue you right click Trend and you can see there is this blue line that just appear we're going to change the color to red and that's the trend of the this data data series you can see that we're going up right so we were using average of last four years 12 12 month but it looks like we are going up and the trend is going up and it's very important to see this trend and maybe to include this trend in your forecast right so that's what we're going to do if I go back to my Trends you have multiple way to do Trends you have the exponential not a big change you have the logarithmic the polinomial the power and the moving average you remember the moving average the one we're using if you use 12 months you will have something very similar that what we did uh before okay so we're going to use I'm not going to focus on all of them the most interesting one is the linear one the polinomial is the more advanced one but it's very uh I would say very complex to use and this is way too advance and then we we're almost switching into machine learning using polinomial if you really want to focus on that so the linear one is this one and you can also display the equation on the chart sometimes the equation doesn't work and this is what we're going to learn in the next episode how to do it manually but this is just to show you that there is an equation based on this shot it's called a like the um linear regression a X plus b but in this case I don't know why but this equation is incorrect I'm going to tell you why later so we're going to remove this equation TCH and what we're going to do now we're going to try to do this trend by ourself using a formula an automatic formula in Excel so a few years ago I had to do this manually was very complex but now there is a formula in Excel so you can keep it very simple so how to do that the formula you have two formulas you have the the formula called Trend and you have the formula called forecast linear we're going to use first the trend one to see how it works so it's very simple you use first you're going to use equal Trend you can click here if you want what are the non uh Ys what are the Ys is the the revenue is like what you are the Y is like this axis and this is the revenue so the revenue you know is this one okay we're going to select until here because this one we don't know we're going to forecast this one great what are the X the x is the the date but we're going to use the period it's easier to understand for the system nice what is the new which one are you forecasting we are fusing 55 the new one only this one and this one just press okay usually I don't put anything okay uh wait a minute let me check my formula yeah I'm correct so now I do have this trend and I I will I will have to just basically copy this TR here and I will have to lock my period and my Revenue but this one I leave it free then I can move my formula so now I do like this and I do like this so I have the same result you can also extend the formula if you want and now we're going to see how how it looks into my graph we're going to select data add Trend Automatic Auto series value T okay great so now I have my Trend and you can see that my train is the green one it's a bit different to the red one why because I'm I'm not using the same period on the red one is also considering the revenue of this one but for my specific case I say I don't know this one yet I want to forast this one so that's why this one is a bit different I'm going to remove it so now you can see we have a trend forecast this is an automatic Trend forecast which is pretty cool as you can see and it will give you like okay this is like a moving average but also considering the trend and now we can check the accuracy but before that just to let you know there is another formula which give exact the exact same result and this formula is called forecast linear you can see forecast linear is the same you just have to select the only difference you have to select first the future period and then the revenue and the period but this is the exact same result when you click on it the X first you select the next period and then your revenue and your period you have the exact same result so I I feel it's EAS even easier you forget about something you want to create a new formula and you you press functions you just type forecast enter and you can see this is the forecast linear we're going to talk about this one later this is the triple exponential smoothing uh but just to let you know now I feel Excel make it make it easier to to understand or also to find if you forget about it so I used this trend linear forecast and this one are exactly the same and I just wanted to to show multiple way to do it if you if you are curious about it because some sometimes people ask me what is the difference what are the difference between these two but they're exactly the same so now if I go back to my shot and I'm going to check my accuracy so the trend L our forecast you can see that we are plus 6% for the Bas and for the accuracy 75.6% okay 75.6% uh this is not this is not even better than the the average months why because in the last 12 months as you can see in the graph we didn't we didn't have a a positive grow in the last year so that's why the trend didn't make it better than the average forast if if I was checking the accuracy maybe of the last two years I will probably have better result than the average why because I can see that overall we're growing but not for the last uh the last period that was very similar to the previous one okay so what we're going to do in the next episode I'm going to tell you more about the trend formula if you are curious but this is not mandatory if it's already too complex for you
okay so now let's go back to the trend optimization the trend optimization is very important based first of all on the the selection and the P you're going to use so this is not a mandatory episode if this is too complex you can just accelerate but I I received a lot of question based on that so I'm going to I'm going to go deeper first what is important in your selection is like if you don't select the same period you will have a very different result for example if I move this selection uh for example if I move my Trend with only one year or let's say like this period it was 38 t t tck and then I need to duplicate my formula T I'll just copy the formula everywhere you can see that if I only use the last uh 18 months now my my my trend is declining why because you said you know what you it looks like you're are declining if you only take this this period so BAS on the selection of your Trend it will be completely different now if I use another one if I really use the very short term for example only six or seven periods like this CL and I'm going to copy everywhere this formula you can see that now my my forecast is exploding why because I only took if I only took this I'm going to just to keep it simple I'm going to use this and this I'm going to do the graph of this this is the graph only of the perod that selected so if I select the trend could be the same you can see that now I'm going I'm going up very fast so you have to be very careful when you select a trend which period are you are you selecting because if this is a Too Short period with a like of strong positive or negative Trend or if this is a too long period And this is not relevant anymore you could have a very weird Trend that would be selected also if you have very low sales or inter intermittent product the trend will not mean um anything so I I want it first to go back to this um Trend selection which is very important you can do control Z now to understand the [Music] difference okay so this is the the normal one that was the first thing I wanted to show you and as well just for the most curious one in the past like 15 years ago at school I learned how to how to create the the formula for this this is not relevant anymore in Excel but this formula is called ax plus b ax plus b is like is the formula for linear regression and how do you get this number you can get it from the shot when it's working so I was showing before at TR line and you can display the equation on the chart so you can see why equal 543 x minus this number and that will give you the formula of this trend line the problem is this sometimes doesn't work I don't know why so this if you try this formula it won't give you the same result but there is another way to do it and this other way is a specific formula called slope and intercept so A and D and how do you do the formula this is the you going to multiply the per by this number plus this number slope and intercept and there is a Formula called slope and you just select the same revenue and period so the same Revenant period that you used before like that we did for the trend that will give you the the value for the a value and this is for the B value this is mathematics it's not important if you don't understand but just for the the most curious one so you have a and b and then how to find the to design this um this graph and value you go back to the trend manual and what we're going to do I'm going to do it again we're going to do Revenue oh wait wait not no Revenue we're going to take the period the first period times a the slope we're going to lock this with F4 plus b F4 and by doing that we will have the same result than the trend formula from Excel or the focus linear Focus so you can see I have the same formula can do like this and you will have the exact same result so for the one who are very curious or maybe you are not in Excel you need to have what is the trend formula you can use Excel to Define what is the what we call the slop and intercept use this as a variable then you can pull it into your software and that's that's how you can generate a trend yeah I just wanted to show you that but this is clearly not monitary because today everything is automatic and I want to keep it simple for you so that was one of the most complex episode but I wanted to go deeper for the one who are curious
in the last episode we we were working with the trend we're going to addde these two columns we did the all basically all the linear and very stable forecast but we can feel that something is missing right we are not following the waves of uh of this Revenue the wavs of life and that's what we're going to do in this for we're going to start talking about seasonal model which looks much more accurate at least on the on the graph so that what's what we're going to do before that I forget something if you correct your sales history I recommend to add a comment so you can um for example if you change the value you can uh write a new command and say correction just to make sure that the people behind you understand what's happening so I don't need this one I'm going to delete the command but that's was just a quick reminder if you do anything manually in your file then we're going to talk about seasonal forecast so the first one we're going to do is Trend and seasonality because I really like the trend of my forecast what was the trend right click select data I'm going to add the trend in our forecast okay so you can see that we have a trend I like this trend but I would have just to give more seasonal it and that's what we were checking in the previous chapter with financial forecast we do have a seasonality in this revenue on this specific company every year there is a peak in around Springtime May June July and August and the revenue is much lower uh early and end of the year so what we're going to do we need to once again we need to um Define what is the percentage of seasonality I already done that on the right you can see we need to do a pivot table that will detect if you have a sity or not before that there is a formula for that there is a specific formula called uh forecast ETS seasonality so if you do that this formula and you select your period and uh like your revenue and your period it will give you it will send you back what is the seasonality detection you say oh every 12 period you have a seasonality okay so it's pretty cool if you want to have a a confirmation this is an automatic detection from Excel we're going to use it later in the uh automatic forecast with Excel but just to let you know so what we're going to do we're going to do this work again we've done it before so I'm going to go fast we select the date and the revenue only with information we're going to create pivot table from table Ranch existing worksheet location going just do it below up okay then I want to see per months and I want to see my revenue and I just add the filter for the year because why I don't want to have uncomplete year for my seasonality so you have to remove the last year and maybe you can remove the 2020 we already corrected the 2020 but just just in case this is maybe not relevant so we're going to remove it and if you didn't correct the data it's better to remove the weird and specific year such as the pandemic year now you have this revenue and what we're going to do we're going to we're going to create the basis 100 and this is the exact same formula so I'm going to copy and paste we've done that before you can copy and past this is just the sum of the revenue of this specific month January divided by the average of the full year like this and at the end we can see that January is 69% of a normal month June 120 etc etc so you can create a graph insert like this maybe and this is your seasonality level ah it doesn't work when you do like this okay you can do like this because this is a pivot table and set graph seasonality right congratulation you have a seasonality graph in percentage and what we need to know now we need to connect this with our like we need to connect the level and the seasonality the level is okay I'm I'm selling x uh product per month and the seity is this is the percentage I wants to apply so how to do that we need to connect we're going to start with the trend plus seasonality you can see this one going to remove this one and I'm going to I want to connect this one with my seasonality how to do that for that we need to vook up so I'm going to I'm going to start from this one I'm going to suppress first I need to connect the months of this and the months of my table here and the months of my table here the problem is I have generary I don't have a number so I just created a link here and I just put one two etc etc then I'm able to V up I do like this up then I can V look up from this colum to my basis 100 and then it's very simple I go back to my Trend equal I need to change my keyboard is always moving between French and English it's a long story so my video cup I'm looking for the months period and the month period so I create another column and I just use the formula months and my date so months with this and it just give me seven okay so you need to have a connection with the same information I cannot connect with this I need to connect with the number of the months so I do VAP like this of my months my current months I go back to my table and you can select your table like this or like this as you feel but let's do like this and I'm going to press so my V will be the colum number four 1 2 34 and then zero trian so I have one but this one in percentage is 128% so this is the the seasonality of July 128% and then it's very simple you can multiply this number by what you want so you could multiply by the the trend or the season it in this specific case we're going to first lock my table like this perfect and I'm going to multiply this v c times the trend linear forecast for example up I'm going to copy this all along formula great and now let's see how it looks so I'm going to I'm going to redo a graph because I feel this one has way too many so we're going to do this two and this this two I press control and I select these three four columns insert graph great I know my screen is moving a lot sometimes but I I do my best to have as much Zoom as possible for you as well guys so you can see the revenue the TR the the trend in a focus is the orange one and the trend plus seasonality looks much better right you can see that it's pretty cool seasonal forecast so now we have this and we can check the accuracy of this so let's go back to the right Trend linear forecast and Trend plus seasonality we have the same result in terms of BS but in term of accuracy w w we move from 10 millions of error to 4 millions and the accuracy jump from 75 to 90 so we we make 15 points of improvement just by implementing a very simple seasonality which is amazing right so obviously you can see it in the graph this looks much more accurate the yellow one than the orange one and that's what we're going to do we're going to know you're going to do other options to improve this accuracy with other models forecasting models
okay so in the previous episode we starting talking about seasonality I'm going to delete this graph and now we have this pretty cool uh seasonal seasonal forecast and we're going to create new options so your options are basically infinite you can really decide what you want to do I'm going to explore different different for you but you you are really open to do whatever you want and you can create your own models and just track the accuracy to see if it's better so I I really like this format called average 12 months plus seasonality uh we use the exact same formula so I'm using the V lookup of the seasonality and this time I'm going to multiply by my 12 months forecast like this clack so this is the formula and let's see how it looks let's see how it looks 12 months okay where is my graph this is the graph so the average 12 amounts let's change the colors this and let's change the revenue to White so the blue one is the new one you can see that we are pretty close between the the trend one and the average one the only thing is like you can see that the yellow is growing a bit when the blue remain stable uh in this case so you have a less grow which I think would be better because there is no gross in uh in this specific data set for the last 12 months so let's check now the accuracy of this one average 12 months plus seasonality now we have a better Bas and in terms of accuracy guys we have 93. 43% which is really good really good like only 6% of error is pretty pretty impressive I'm very proud of you and myself as well and uh and yeah so you could do that you could also try say oh maybe I can do instead of 12 months you could multiply by 4 years or 2 years or 6 months and really try to be creative in the way you experiment to see what is the best forecast accuracy in the next episode this time we're going to add growth in this forecast
okay so now in this episode we're going to talk about the average 12 months seasonality plus gross because why you can see that we are growing every year and it would be too bad not to include some growth in your average right so that's that's a model I really like and that we're going to use much more in the in the future with my uh with the forecasting per product with multiple products that's why I wanted to introduce this one so we do have this average TR mons and if I press okay here you could say but you know what I want to do something even better I want to I want to add a gross in this forecast so what we're going to do we're going to say I want to add 5% because my target is maybe plus 5% per year so I'm going to multiply this average 12 months plus seasonality I'm going to copy this formula or I'm going to do like this equal this time 1.05 that's plus 5% for forecast I'm going to C like this CL and I'm going to add this into the shot average 12 months press gross okay I know we can see on the graph that the group green one is a is a bit above the blue one which looks cool so let let's see the accuracy of this one plus gross we are a bit above the total and the accuracy is not better than the 12 months why because in the specific data set when we look at the numbers the the period the period we are using here this period we made 42 millions and if I take the same period we did almost the same values so there is no like big Ross between these two that's why it's normal that we are not the 5% gross that I manually was not very relevant so what you can do you have multiples option I'm going to start by using a we're going to use a manual version and we're going to optimize with the solver and then we're going to find an automatic one I'm moving a lot my screen sorry guys what we're going to do now we're going to I'm going to remove this one we going to add a manual version here we're going to like for example 5% and we're going to apply this one and optimize this one 1 + 5% so this is this is my number great what I could do is optimize this number with the the X solver so I'm going to go to data solver and this time I want to maximize my accuracy of this one by changing my percentage of grow this one and my constraints I'm going to change I'm going to delete no Oops I did I want to change this okay and my constraint is I don't want to grow more than less than 0.1 10% because it's going to be too much anyway and I want to add another one more than not more than minus 0.1 okay so now I have these two and I'm going to solve this problem to see what is the best grow for this specific one is it plus 1% plus 3% of 1% and see how does it work so I like the solver because it can be very can give you a shortcut to give you a clear answer very quickly you have to be very careful always don't give too many options to the server other way it's going to run for hours or just crash your your laptop or computer if you have a super computer this is okay okay but uh I like to do it once not too long okay so we found a solution and the solution is 5% H I think I I select the wrong one V so I I picked the wrong one it was this one it was I took the the exponential smoothing but it was I want to optimize this one sorry about that so I need to solve again I was the wrong selection for the objective and now we can talk about we can talk more about what do you want what do you want me to talk about how do you feel this is maybe a bit too complex I'm going a bit deep but at the end the IDE is just go back to this tab look at the formulas there is not one perfect formula and the more you will practice the more you will understand the the game and for me this is just a game and this is a video game and you want to have the best results and for that we use m mle formulas and you will see at the end that this is not the most complex one that we win and the one we're using right now just an average multiply by seasonality can be very efficient and know this is good I'm a bit tired I'm going to okay so the result is minus 0.31% to have the best accuracy you're going to head and you are we are just a little better than this one we have 7,000 do less error by using this one with Z minor 0.31% gross than this one so congratulation for that sorry for my uh mistakes with the solver but it's good to see that I'm I'm human too I'm not perfect there there will be another solution as well you could also use an automatic gross based on the trend I'm going to go deeper into that in the trend chapter later with 500 products but just to let you know you could also calculate what is the trend on you know this Orange um orange curve here you can see that we are growing by uh x% every day but the not every day every month but it's not easy to write so what I did I just did a formula that just check this month versus the month before and you can see we're growing by 7% and what you could do you could apply the same formula here to say okay this month based on the forecast linear forecast is growing by 7% versus the months 12 months before but in this specific case we're growing by 7% and the best result is not plus 7 it's minus 0.3 so I want to have better result but I just wanted to introduce this uh parameter because we're going to use it later it's much easier if you talk with sales and marketing to talk about percentage of gross or negative growth than just talking about uh linear progression ax Alpha Beta etc etc so that was just an INT production but let's keep it simple for now and I see you for another episode
okay so now we're going to talk about double and triple exponential smoothing but to be honest it's not easy to explain if you check the mathematics again it's like double and triple this is a lot of mathematics and I don't want to do that for you so today for me you don't have to understand the math you have to understand how to do it and what are the main principle and look look at the graph you will understand the the power of it for that there is a new new features in Excel that really like you can generate automatic forecasts with Excel and we're going to go back to this if you don't know these features what you have to do for that you just have to select the period you want for example this and the revenue you press control and you select you can try with the date but sometimes it doesn't work depends on the format when you do that then you press you go to D you go to data and you click forus sheet if you don't see this option is maybe because you don't have at least the the Exel 2016 that was a long time ago so you don't have this option and you won't have the option as well to generate this formula so I recommend maybe just to watch this video if this is the case and maybe to switch to a later latest version of excel because this is a very cool feature to to focus so now when you click on that W you already have a forast you have the main one and you also have this these two lit okay and what are these two lit I'm going to go back to this after but you have first of all you have more options the first one is how long do you want to forecast how many months after the end of your Revenue you want one two 3 months so we have 65 period 66 so let's add two more years 56 no 66 + 24 equal 90 okay so we have two more years then if you press this is where the forecast start you could say like us oh you know what I want to I I don't want to start here because we started the forast one months not one year before to improve it so you could say I want to do the same so I want to do 54 and that will be the same it will do the same forecast one year before but let's keep it simple let's keep it this way then what we have we call it the confidence interval the confidence interval is just to tell you okay I'm 95% confident that my forecast will be between the minimum and the maximum the lower confidence and the upper confidence if you increase if you know I want to be 99.9% sure it will increase the Gap because you want to be sure so it will increase the the safety between these two if you lower you say no it's okay I just want 80% you're going to see it's going to be closer so this is this is an introduction to probabilistic forecasting we're going to talk about it later with my my friend Mario from Amazon this is a bit too advanced but just for the visualization I really like to have a best case scenario and a worst case scenario so let's go back to 95 and then you have the seasonality so Excel can automatic automatically detect if you have a seasonal data series or not you can say automatically and you can say there is a 12 that mean you found that you have a pattern that is repeating every 12 periods or every 12 months in this specific case if you set manually you can also change manually but it's going to mess up the forecast if you do for example six he's going to try to find like seasonality every six period or three it's going to do like this right but it doesn't look great so I recommend to all leave it automatic or manually and if you define zero it's going to is going to skip the seasonality and in this specific case if you put zero if you use this this formula is called the triple exponential smoothing and you don't have to do all the MTH behind you already have it if you do zero like this you say there is no this is an exponential smoothing only with a trend you can see there is a trend so we did the simple before with no Trend the double is with the trend and the triple is with the seasonality so now you understand the difference between simple double and triple and it's much easier to press one button and to do all the mathematics so let's keep it this way and just click on include forecast statistics on the right side you you always keep interpolation if you have missing points for example you have two months missing is going to interpolate and use the you going to average the the point between um before and after and to to have something relevant or if you put zero if you have missing point is going to put zero and don't try to connect the dots so if you have for example two data point missing it's going to put zero and if you use interpolation it's going to say oh I'm going to do the average of the point before and after and say I think we are here okay so just to let you know but in this specific one we don't have any missing point so we won't change anything and the aggregate duplicate is the same if you have like duplication in your data set is going to do the average of all your duplicates but we don't have duplicate so it's okay we press create and boom we have a focus my friend we have an amazing forecast pretty cool I change the color always as you see I'm very picky with the color and we have this forecast we have also the alpha beta remember alpha beta and gamma we also have the ma the forecasting error and the root root mean square error the two why because you use it to optimize and find what what would be the best parameters to find this forecast the most accurate forecast based on this story so so we did basically everything we did before it did it automatically for this specific model uh not using necessar only the last 12 months but uh that I think that's a very cool way to start something and if you want to have the forecast this is my forecast here and this is my lower confidence bound and this is my upper confidence bound so if you really don't have the time you know you never done forecast in your life you use this Excel sheet and it doesn't look crazy you know maybe it's not super down that would be one of the mistake of this forecast but at least you know I have something relevant that I can use so you can just copy and paste this this forecast and have it to your um to your spreadsheet or to your Revenue company forecasting so I really like this uh this point the only thing is you cannot really you can canot go back to the prompt we did before so if I want to change one parameter I need to go back go to data FOC Focus sheet again and I have to do it again and select all my the parameters I want so you cannot go back to this screen directly from this tab here but you have formulas directly that you can use and that's what we're going to use in the next episode we can use this formula and in this formula we have everything we need to define the double and the triple exponential smoothing
okay my friends so in the previous episode we were generating automatic forecast with Excel which is pretty cool but now let's go back to this file and I want to have my double exponential smoothing and my triple exponential smoothing this formula the double one and the triple one are very complex once again this is the formula welcome to the mat and this is the triple one I don't want to do that this is not the goal of ABC Supply Chain we want to give you the right tools that you can Implement immediately for your focusing and the double one what we're going to use first for the Curious one I just gave you an example of double exponential smoothing if you really want to do it you can check this formula but it's very complex because you need to have the smooth level and the smooth Trend and then you will have the formula and uh to be honest if you have 500 prods this is just not sustainable and you need to Define an alpha and beta which are different from the simple one so this is not easy but if you really want to go deeper there is one example I'm not going to provide support on the manual formula because this is uh just to not relevant if you want to have multiple forast but there is a much faster way using Excel formula keep in mind that last time in my previous episode I say hey guys there is a Formula here and you just have to use this formula forecast ETS the first you need to select what is the next period Then what is my revenue or my quantity sold and then what is my period I want to to have in the p and then you have these parameters so if you click on FX seasonality and data completion so this one is you can always use one or zero if you don't want um it was just to for the missing values and this one is to activate or not the seasonality if you press zero it's gonna it's going to disable the seasonality if you press one it's going to detect automatically if you press for example 12 you say I want a seasonality of 12 okay so I want to do like this it will be the same and then it's going to change automatically my formula what I want in this first one I don't want any seasonality and if I disable the seasonality I have I have a double exponential smoothing so that's what we're going to do you could do it in this one directly zero if I do like this this is the forecast I have you see I disabled my seasonality and now we're going to do it I'm going to go back I'm going to go back to this file and we're going to use the same formula forecast ETS so I'm going to do it again with you my target date is the new 155 my values are the revenue I know before my timeline is the timeline I know always in numbers it's much much better seasonality zero data completion one we won't change anything okay and boom I have my formula I think I have my formula why is it different no it's the same then I just need to lock F4 F4 F4 F4 I know we have the same formula everywhere you can just copy and paste the formula before and after great so now that we have this we can select the data add a new one and let's see how it looks okay it looks terrible that's a great one why because there is no seasonality involved and it's like a KN forecast at one point is going to start for at one point so that's why I didn't want to spend too much time on the double one but in the next episode we can we can check the accuracy just for fun it's going to be bad and the double one is like 70% of accuracy which is the worst one ever so I don't recommend this one because it's too reactive it's automatic and even if I didn't like and and Excel tried to optimize the parameters so we we don't even need the solver Excel because it did it himself and it doesn't look great so now uh we're going to go to the next episode with the triple exponential smoothing
okay so now in this episode we're going to talk about the triple exponential smoothing and it's very simple you take this one you copy here and this time you do one here so it's going to detect automatically your seasonality sometimes it doesn't detect automatically and you can force the seasonality just to let you know I was explaining a formula quickly before it's called seasonality detection yeah this one and we use basically this formula called forast ETS seasonality and in this specific case you found 12 so in this case we we found 12 just to let you know it's interesting we're going to use it later but sometimes it doesn't find it's not sure like if it's not if you don't have a strong correlation of your data you could say you know what I want to make sure so I want to put 12 here so in this specific case I will have the exact same results you can see I have the same result but sometimes it doesn't detect correctly and you can you have to can force the value okay so now we have the triple exponential wiing we have the simple one plus the trend plus the seasonality and let's see how it looks in the shot add one oops IIT okay so the last one we did was the blue one one you can see this one and doesn't look it looks okay but not amazing I don't know why it's not going super D like my manual seasonality haha ha so now let's check the accuracy of it and the accuracy the Bas is above and the accuracy is 80% so you can see at the end my friend that this very complex formula doesn't bring and there you have an optimization with Excel doesn't bring a better accuracy with my specific selection so we took the last 12 months of history that we know only 80% wants my simple average plus seasonality average 12 months plus seasonality is providing me 93% of accuracy if I check my RC I have the same a very similar result this this one is the lower one you need to F to focus on the because we're talking about error so we have to to lower this one as much as possible and what we can see that Simplicity can be very efficient uh of course we need to have a seasonality because there is a strong seasonality pattern uh but at the end uh it's not always the most complex one so I wanted just to conclude with that to say like you have to understand the game of testing you can even try your own forecasting model you could say oh I'm going to do the average of the last two years multiply by the seasonality try try try and the more you will try we try 10 different models and at the end we know which one is the best for this specific one now we're going to check these formulas and models with different products to see if we have the same results
okay my friends so now we did all these different models seasonal non-seasonal simple very Advanced and I want to try with different products to see if we have the same results if the the average 12 months plus seasonality is the best or not so I adding this file different topics electricity bike light water bottle mons and phone holder they're all coming from the data set from I Will Survive and the good thing is we already have the right format so we just need to know to duplicate what we did to try on different product so what we're going to do now we're going to go back to iws Global we're going to right click move and copy create a copy at WS Global now we're going to move this one here and I'm going to just say okay you go to data set you say okay this time the revenue is not in value is in quantity and we're going to just copy let's say it's coming from your Excel spreadsheet and you can just replace this revenue and this is not dollars this time this is in quantity but this is exactly the same principle oh I did something wrong Tu tuck okay I'm going to remove this by numbers where are my numbers no numbers clack clack clack okay so now we have these numbers and everything is automatically up to date you can see like we have you can see the sales of this product are very uh I would say unstable some maybe we do we did that shortages or Stocker during the past but we can see that there is a trend to to grow and when we look at the seasonal model it looks it looks pretty Rel as well you know it's moving a bit like this so let's see which one is the most accurate you only have one thing to change you have to be careful is the seasonality so the seasonality when when you duplicate an Excel tab you need to change the source of this pivot table pivot table so we go back here pivot table change the data source okay and you was in global and now you want to do it to Global to so you just select here and is already changing the source you press okay and now you can see that we have much less quantity for the for this example and the seasonality is a bit different okay so now we have this there is a question is maybe also do do we have to remove change the the pandemic results yes or no I don't think there is a big difference in this one so I'm not going to correct this but now let's see what are the result of all my all my models this is not in dollar this is in quantity and the best result and the winner is T the same one average 12 months plus seasonality average 12 months plus seasonality you have this one seasonality plus grow the only one I we didn't optimize was the simple exponential smoing and to be honest I did it here so I can tell you what is the best result you can use the the except solver and the result was the same it was this one I think and at the end it's much better to use again the average 12 months plus seasonality so very interesting I could also update with the solver the growth of this model if you are curious you can optimize these parameters yourself but it won't give you a better result than 99 89 sorry. 3% okay so very interesting we have the same for the RC as well now that was Electric City B if I check other models you can maybe pause the video try to do the light one by yourself to see if you understand but if I check the result this is the like light for your bike they are very intermittent as you can see you have massive Peak here so in this specific one we had a I think it was a club or school that bought a lot of products for in one shot so that was not easy to predict the seasonality is not as strong I already updated the seasonality you can you can see the SE start to be a bit messy because we don't have a lot of volumes and when we see the results the winner this time is again the average 12 months plus seasonality okay but you can see that the the gap between a very simple one such as four years and this one is very very small before it was like 10 or 15 points different 89 as you can see up to uh like 20 or 30 points different this time the the Gap are pretty small and also the the overall accuracy is lower we we the maximum we can reach is 75% one before it was close to 90% why because this is very difficult to predict this kind of uh cells like this unless you have the information before okay now then we have the water bottle water bottle is a bit the same like we have few thousand sold water bottle for bicycle only but you have this massive peek at the end and you can see that based on the model it's uh it's not always relevant and this time the most accurate one is even simpler and you can see it's 56% of accuracy average 12 months of accuracy this is not great but this is the reality how can you predict this kind of peck so what you can do if you know in advance you can plan in your forecast we're going to talk about override or you could even say you know what this one is not Rel 11 so we're going to put 3,000 let's see if it's changing the the results of the who the best forecasting model so if I remove this pick which one is the best it's still the average 12 months 71% you you could see we we make 20 points Improvement just by collecting one one data point because it was so bad it was just messing up everything but if you don't know that's the reality sometimes you don't you don't know in advance so this is your reality you will have 12,000 quantity and the best you can do in terms of accuracy is just around 50% s when we check about mountain bik now we are into very low low sales from zero to three or six looks like they only selling this prod by three three quantities maybe that's the the pette with three bikes and at this time when we look at it the seasonality doesn't mean anything to be honest and this time we have only 60% of accuracy and yeah the the best one is Trend plus seasonality but it's very similar to this one at then you can see like in quantity we have almost the same result so just a trend linear forecast and when we look at the trend linear forecast is just a flat forecast to say you should forecast basically three quantity every every day you can see like here up we're going to move this so also something very important when you forus you don't need to forus full full run number we have 2.9 3 like 5.25 at the end this is a you you don't need to have a r number for that because if you if you only sell like your focus is one or two quantity per year you will have 0.01 Etc and then it's only about Inventory management that you're going to run up your quantities or not I'm giving a lot of information but at the end when you have very small volume usually like very simple models are the best and for this specific one it's it's a very simple one the problem with seasonality is not like you have very very low volume so it doesn't mean like it was just L that you you got a big peek in August but most of the time it's it's not very relevant when you look at the last one phone older this is a very uh small quantity product okay the triple exponential Ming even give you negative results minus one minus one so I could Define I could put in my formula if this is less than zero just put zero just to in in terms of safety we're going to do that later uh but at the end the best result of this one is again Trend plus seasonality but the seasonality is even worst it's like 400% it was just luck cuz it was just like okay you had a it was just a good good luck that you your forecast reach out the same moment of your seasonal so this is one of the conclusion I'm going to give you later at the end the seasonality doesn't make a lot of sense or even the trends when you have very very low volume with your product so I do not recommend to connect seasonality or trends for very small volumes we're going to see that later when when we going to forecast 500 products but I just wanted to make it clear for you in this specific episode that at the end it's not necessarily the best or the most advanced model that will give you the best result for example the tri exponential smoothing it try to overreact all the time and it just give you a very poor result so you can do it with multiple products and in the next episode I'm going to tell you how to choose the right one
okay so now in this episode you're going to ask me okay great I check uh high high volumes low volumes uh very intermittent ones and I don't know which one is the best how do I choose the best for all my products so you have two possib you have multiple possibilities well the first one is you can try all your models with all your products this is very time consuming this is exhausting unless you have a program that will do it for you automatically so you have few forecasting software that can do that they're going to try multiple software but in Excel to be hon is going to be very time consuming and to be honest not necessary very efficient the second one is like you try multiple example and you make your own conclusion you say you know what it looks like the average 12 months plus seasonality is not too bad it's almost always winning and not when it's losing it's not really far you know like it's not really really far it's always and you know what the most important is not for your because for your small um for your slow slow movers products like at the end the total error is only two piece when you look at the lights your total error your gap between the worst and the best is like 2,000 so you really make sure first that it's working for your most important product and for the most basic one just keep it very simple and the average plus maybe a seasonality but not at the the item level but the category will be much efficient than just trying to find a very proactive model that will just overreact when you have a massive cells like for example the what this one like this one you don't want to overreact when you forecast a lot of products because you won't have the time to see all every single information every single day so what I recommend is to really to play and become become more sensitive or what would be the the best model for maybe 10 or maybe three four five or six different products with very different behavior and see how does it look and look at the graph as well and look at does it look okay so that will be the the most relevant method especially if you stay in Excel and that's the one we're going to use later with multiple products and I'm going to teach you how to track the accuracy not only on one product in the same time but on on the lot of products and if you have to decide about only one model you want to to pick the one that will improve the overall accuracy uh inv value not only the accuracy for a specific group of product what you could do as well you could say oh for specific category I'm going to use one model for ERS I'm going to use another model that's much more complex but you could also do that if you're ready for that okay and the last option will be to U use to leave Excel so I I I just show you 10 different models you could create your own models and try your accuracy the more you will play the more you will learn but you could also say you know what with this is we're going to talk about python later but you could you could try different different models using different Technologies such as python we did we did it with Excel with the triple expon sming but you have for example the sarima which is very close to the the triple exp monal smoothing you have the profet develop by Facebook and you're going to you're going a lot different model you're going to try and test and you're going to see which one is the best for for one product or for 10,000 products at the end it's always the same you want to track the accuracy and and check which one overall give you the best accuracy for all the the products or um type of Time series that you want to optimize so this is just for information I don't I don't ask you to to check all of this and we're going to get back to this later when we talk about Python and also later about machine learning but I hope that by doing all this example you better understand that the most important is there is not one best model for everything but there is a way to to understand is like the more you will train and practice and see the r the more you will understand the game and then I've been working with a lot of very complex model is not always the most complex one that will give you the best accuracy
okay so now that we did a lot of example with multiple products this is the opportunity for you to forecast by yourself so this is the example of apple apple uh is a very fast and big growing company and you can see uh the revenue this time per quarter so the revenue per quarter and I'm going to ask you to do the same forecast naive average average one year you as much as you can and you want to be honest and try to do the same forecast this time we're going to focus only we're going to keep only the last year as a the year 22 the last this quarters to to forecast why because we had also the pandemic and I think it's more relevant to only focus on this period if you take two years it's going to be maybe too close to the pandemic so that's that's my interpretation but you can do your own if you prefer and I really want you to find what is the best uh what is the best model to forecast the revenue of Apple so you can pause this video and practice as much as you want you can spend 5 minutes 1 hour you can copy and paste my formula or do it by yourself from zero and we're going to check together okay so now I hope you did you tried the most important is to try I know you can see all the results here and I did exactly the same I copy and paste the formula the main difference is the seasonality this time per quarter so the seasonality is not per month it's per qu but it could be also per week if you have a data set per week and what I did was just to switch from uh months to quarter and this is my seasonality we have a strong seasonality in Q4 because this is Christmas and uh you have more people buying Apple produ at the end of this year at the end of the year that at the quar number two okay so we have this seasonality and I just connected the seasonality of the quar I just used the formula call left to get the number of the quarter and then you can apply for the seasonality models at the end you have multiple solution and it looks like we have a seasonality so I'm sure the seasonality model will be probably more efficient than this one so let's see who is the winner 3 two 1 and the winner is the average 12 months plus seasonality again why there is no growth or Trend you could see that maybe this one could win with the the trend why because in the last year of Apple I don't see any uh strong growth so when we look 2022 we did 385 and the year before we did 386 though there is no positive trend on on the the last year so maybe the selection it was not relevant to take so many um so many years of History because at the end the the revenue of Apple didn't grow between 202 and 202022 um it will probably I know already because we are we are more than we I know more results now and I can tell you that the the revenue of Apple is still growing so that's that's one of the reason why the trend doesn't work but I will definitely in the future use a percentage of grow such as okay I will use the financial forecast from Apple you say okay the the micro economics said that we're going to grow by 5 or 10% this year times the average 12 months times the se8 and I will probably in the future have very interesting result at the end we are not very far between these two and this three and this one are not relevant and uh the this time the Triple exponential Ming is not too bad it's pretty good but the average 12 months is more accurate in this specific example okay so I really encourage you to to play as well I did the same with the um automatic forecast with Excel you can also maybe try to focus if you really want to have fun what would be the focus of iPad for example what would be the forus of iPad or iPhone you you can see that iPad are now not growing anymore but iPhone are still growing so the more you will uh be curious the more you will have fun and it's interesting to play with with product we know so that's it for this exercise size have fun practice with me and in the next chapters we're going to start focusing multiple products in the same time
all right so now let's forecast not only for one product but for 500 products this is the step number four not only focusing Baseline but then we're going to forus new products and promotion this is the biggest topic of the course of course so I'm going to split it into different chapters and we're going to practice with the real products from I Will Survive company and keep in mind now you only have two weeks to give more visibility to glance Armstrong we were learning a lot it was necessary but now we have we have a lot of pressure to deliver more accurate forecast at the item level and the global level as well because there still there still you you learn a lot but we we didn't provide much value for them except at the global level Financial forecast uh so just to keep you keep you in the in the loop we do have different products we have electric bik which are growing very fast we have mountain bike and we have road bike and multiple accessories like um like like lockers helmet light and different clothing collection winter collection summer collection with very very different behaviors uh to forecast and for the supply chain so what are we going to forecast we do have the production part we have the distribution and we have the customer part what I was explaining before is it would be very complicated to forast per customer let's say you have 200 customers it will be very complex to generate forast per item per customer so I recommend to keep it very simple and for most of this uh structure I recommend to do only one forecast with all your customer included it could be like from the warehouse the the Expedition from the warehouse or it could be the Expedition from your own Factory if you have a f Factory but I recommend to use this format so we're going to focus at the global level this compan is only in the US uh but we're going to focus the global level at the item level and then we're going to do it per month in this specific example why are we doing it per month because all the company and the figures and all the sales history are per month if you're if your company is working per week maybe your Distribution Company and you're used to work per week you will use the exact same principle if you follow my previous course I also use uh sometimes week figures and sometimes monthly figures so that's what we're going to Deep dive item level World and per month and we're going to do all the forecast and consolidate and compare with the financial forecast because keep in mind that in this specific example we have to grow by 10% and the year to date is only 0% and we don't know why are we not reaching the Target right what is the what is the where is the gap and for that first we're going to forus per item and then in the next chapters we're going to check where the Gap are so in this first step in this first chapter we're going to focus on Baseline forecast and statistical forecast and just to keep you keep you in mind we have three pillars that you really need to understand whatever you're using XL and Erp it's very important in your mind that you understand that we have three pillars we have the level that we were covering before like how many per month in average are you selling how many then you have the trend are you growing or declining for example we have um categories of products such as BMX bicycles they are declining and others like electric bikes that they are growing really fast and you have the seasonality which is different from the trend it's more like do you have a cycle that repeat every year we do have a cycle for example for the biks that sell more during the springtime and we have more products sold for winter time for the the closing winter collection so you have these three and you we going to combine this these three into one B Baseline forecast that's what we're going to do not only for one product this time but for multiple products and then in the next chapters we're going to enrich the forecast we call it forecast value added we're going to add more commercial input overwrite to improve the basine forecast and to have the final forecast before checking the accuracy of this forecast and trying to improve the forecast so this is the process I'm repeating always the same the same uh principles but they're really important that you really get to this logic as well from forecasting to measuring to analyzing to improving and in this uh the next episode we're going to start first to really focus on how to scale the level the how you forecast the level not only for one product but for more than 500 products
all right guys so few of you members told us that you had a problem is the date format so I'm going to tell you how to fix it it's it's very simple in my specific data set we're using the American United States format so we do have first the month and then the day and that's why because it's an American company and I just wanted to to make sure that it's clear for you like for example this number is is 1st of September not n of January okay so that's a different way for example if you're in Europe you have the same form you have the opposite and you don't have to do any manual operation to clean that you just have to go back to the par query so you go back to this file you go to data qu and connection TCH you open the file and you will just go to you can refresh after you will go to the date to this tab you go to date so last time we did just we selected the date format but this time you're going to use using local you can replace the current okay it's loading for the first time and what you going to select maybe you had the text format you're going to switch to dates and very important you have to select English United States so for example if you're in France or Switzerland it's going to select Switzerland automatically you have to go back and say you know I want the United States format it doesn't mean going to change for you but it's going to tell to par oh this is an American United States format so you press okay and now you're good to go don't forget to do it for every single query using a date format always use the American format I'm always using this one for this specific course and method then you click on close and load and for me is not going to change anything because I'm already using the right format for my computer but you should see all the months and all the format for the next episode so make sure this is correct make sure this is the same case for every single step with the date format inut query and I see you for another episode
in this episode I wanted to go back to the fact like maybe you're going to tell me Ed I don't know why but your file is very slow so let's give a try for me it can be slow because I'm recording in the same time so it's a very heavy process for my computer but let's say uh if I select my a product if it's coming instantly it's okay if it's not maybe your computer is not as fast as mine uh so I'm going to teach you how to have a faster Excel file while because it's you you may have the problem right now I just I just have 500 products but maybe you will have two or 3,000 products or maybe even 10,000 products and the reason why your file will be U slow you I'm going to give you multiple reason to make it faster because if you have much more products I prefer that you have all your products into one file or at least one file per forecaster or per demon planner I do not recommend to split the file because your file is too slow so I'm going to give you multiples methods for that the first one very basic I recommend you to close all the other file open into your computer I see many people with 10 spreadsheet open in the same time this is the worst thing to do also try to close as many application you are running on your computer because the more you have application open the more you will use like active memories from your computer or laptop that's the first thing try also to have a fast internet connection if you work from a drive or a share folder that's the really basic one then what is very efficient if you want to make it faster you go to formula and you disable calcul calculation option you go to manual if you go to manual it will not recalculate all the time it will only recalculate when you press F9 or I'm going to show you here you just go down for example here you go one and one probably already know that and you go equal one + 1 two great when I do three doesn't change doesn't change why because I disabled the calculation so to update my calculation I need to press F9 or I need to save my file by doing that if you have a very very heavy file and I had very heavy file when I was working for example for Red Bull or Deaton it was like 10,000 plus products 20,000 plus uh if you you you can just navigate like this and you will not recalculate all the time so you don't see the difference for me but for you it can be very useful especially if you have a lot of formulas a lot of vup in your file so that's the first thing I would recommend for you to make it faster I'm going to don't forget to where we go formula go back to automatic if you don't need that and don't forget to press F9 key or to save each time you want to display any result or any forecast the second thing you can do is to remove the conditional formatting so you can see my Excel is beautiful also because I have a lot of automatic conditional formatting what is a conditional formatting is just this features for example I want to oh I want to have a specific color for viability for accuracy etc etc but the thing that it's using a lot of power and I have a lot of example for example this one it's a very big one and you can see for me it's even a bit slowing down I have a conditional formatting if uh I'm correcting automatically my uh my level of sales we're going to see that just after but there is a lot of conditional formatting so what you can do the first thing if you really you think my file is really too slow and your file is too slow just try first to remove all of them so you go to home you go to conditional formatting clear rules from the antire sheet by doing that your file will probably be much faster okay much faster I'm recording the same time that's why as well uh but yeah it should be much faster as well so give a try with that and if this is working you just press contrl Z T and then you decide okay maybe the one the less necessary one is maybe this one because you have a lot of sales and you don't have a lot of information uh you can also maybe remove the the one that maybe remove all of them except maybe the avability and the accuracy so just try to go step by step and find a way that it's visible for you and efficient and you are not losing uh yeah you're losing too much speed and too much productivity okay so I think that's the recommend I recommend also I'm using a lot of formulas and many formulas are not always necessary for example I'm using twice I have two kind of forecast the forecast ABC this is my special forast and I have the forecast Excel automatic personality I'm comparing two type of forast but you don't need this second one unless you want to compare them so you could also delete specific columns that you don't need all the time just keep the first row then when you need to duplicate you just double click and you you can just duplicate all of them so you can delete the formula you don't need I will focus especially on on this one and try to keep it as simple as possible and of course the last recommendation is to use powerquery as much as you can instead instead of doing vup in the file you can do it directly into the coron connection you keep just to remind you we have all the data coming from different file and this file are not part of the of the direct file there is no copy and paste there is no even V between sales quantity and sales value so the more you will prepare the data and the less you will have to transform the faster will be your file to your um to make it more efficient for you so I think I cover most of the thing that you can do and of course the next step will be maybe if you have way too many products to leave Excel but at least I recommend to do it on the specific parameters to try to make it work and once it's ready you can move to um automation with a specific software we're going to talk about it later and one more thing I forgot is also I'm using way too much data in this file and at the end we're going to work a lot about different model forecast but at the end I realize that I don't really need I have two 24 months history in my focus but at the end I don't really need 24 months I just need the last 12 months because my my formula is just more efficient for 12 months than 24 months so at the end you can also delete for example this block of the last 12 months you can just delete if my file is too slow and even for you you can delete all this block and even remove all the conditional formatting from this actitude and your file will be much faster because this is a lot of information and maybe you do your your file per week so even you have even more columns per week I recommend to only keep the one that are necessary but I always I will always recommend at least to have 12 months history then you can do your your forecast and your average sales etc etc so I think this is it for for the calculation and to make it faster and we see you for another episode to start forecasting
okay so now let's start talking about the average sales that we we need to to generate the level the level of sales and I don't know if you remember I hope so I go back to the previous file with the different forecasting model we test different model and one of the most efficient one was the it was the average sales 12 months plus seasonality or seasonality plus growth and that's where we're going to go uh with with my file the question is how to do it with a lot of products when I see my file what we're going to do we're going to get the average of the last 12 months and you see this is just an average but we're going to also improve it we're going to correct from outliers from stockout so we're going to go much deeper than in the in the previous episode and we're going to do it in a in a way that you can scale and do it with 500 but also thousand of products if uh necessary so we're going to do that and then in the next episode in the next chapter we're going to add seasonal entrance to have an automatic forecast if I go back to my file it looks a bit scary now because I have a lot of information so let's hide what we can do oops t t and so what do we have in the file first what I recommend to you is to add all the unnecessary columns so we're going to add all of this you can leave right click hide even the classification we're going to cover that later and what do I want is I want my average quantity for 12 months 6 month we're going to do it for 6 months also 3 months two months and 1 months then we're going to add the selector we're going to correct the we're going to correct the the average set by the avability and we we're going to have the average demand it looks very complex When I See This formula but at the end it's just because of we have different selectors that we're going to cover just after but the first step is to get my cells into my file and to always have the last 12 months into my file in a dynamic way then I don't have to do any manual operations each time I'm going to update my file and the goal is first to have all my sales here and then to do to do the average of my sales and then to adjust the level of my cell and for that we're going to go to another tab called level and this table level we're going to get automatically the the data from po query to have the information so that's what we're going to cover in the next episode and just to keep in mind this is the same file that we did at the beginning we did a table format and we just included all the screw list and we have the average sales price and then we connect it to our queries and connection if you think I'm going too fast you don't need to use par for your own file you can have a specific time with your sales but your goal will be to get automatically your your at least your last 12 month sales per week or per month then you can apply different formula and that's what we're going to cover in the next episode
okay so now how to get your average sales per per month automatically in this file we're going to go to this level Tab and what we did you can see there is a pivot table but the main difference of this pivot table is we have first on the left the latest date of my data set we don't have the the the most oldest one first we have the the closest one why because I need to have always the last 12 months and if I do on the other side let's say I'm going to go to my data sales quantity for example the problem of this file is if I always want to have the last 12 months equal average 12 month 1 2 3 4 5 6 like 19 if I do that but then the week the week the next month I will have another month boom I'm going to lose my formula or I will have to move my formula to the right to the left so it's going to be uh it's going to be messy and the idea is to make it as efficient and automatic as possible so that's why we transform this tab into vertical with Pro query we you teach I teach you that just before and now I want to have a dynamic way to get my last 12 months so I'm going to show you a very simple way let's go back you can close this one don't save we can close the non-necessary one this one don't save and know I'm going to do the same for you guys we're going to insert a new sheet right click insert spreadsheet we're going to go to insert pivot table from external data source the connection we're going to use sales or sales quantity we're going to use sales because we have and sales in this one and we're going to press okay now what do I want do it with me very important and then you can do it for your own data set if you want to use my same method you want sales quantity great you want per CU item code and you want per date so the day can be a bit messy you're going to have everything and what you're going to do you're going to un select this this this okay so now we have this and now the trick is very simple you go to this one and you go newest to oldest I know you have the latest one here the next step is I'm going to insert the same block seven figures so I'm going to do like this TCH we do have uh I'm going to just use because we're going to use this later you will understand why after stay with me no like this and what else we can do yeah now we are good and if you want to have the average for example average you do like this boom and you have the average of the last 12 months next month when I'm going to update this file the eight will become nine the seven will become eight and you'll have an automatic shift but you won't have to move anything in your formula you will always have the last 12 months of your um of your calculation for your average sales so that's something very useful that we uh we're going to use this format I use it also for inventory management you can also do it directly into po query and P pivot this is much more so I'm not going to teach you that and the IDE after is to connect this table to my base and do V look up in this table if you if you have for example 10,000 plus item that could be very slow you don't even have to display this product into this table you can directly do the calculation in this tab and just do V up the just the average and not months by months because now I'm going to get months by months all my information but we're going to do that in the next episode
okay so now we do have the sales we do have the sales per month automatically with power query if you don't use powerquery you can use the same pivot table using a normal table but I recommend to use powerquery and then what we're going to do we're going to go back to my base and what now we just need to have a vup that will connect to that I'm using vup you can use xlup you can use andex match it's up to you uh it depends of on your level of maturity the formula looks more complex why because I'm correcting automatically uh the the stock out and no the the outliers with that so we're going to do that later not now we're going to remove that t tac tac for example I'm going to move this one here and we're going to do the VAP again so remove the formula VAP great and then what we're going to do we're going to select the code and we're going to go to level this one and I want to have my l so is going to be number two and number three I'm going to select more because I need more okay just in case and just to keep in mind as well add these numbers manually just to to see what is the which level do I need then I need theel the number two and then zero you was not number two it was number three for this specific month so you can see that I have this formula the good thing to have a table format you see will always duplicate the formula I don't have to do anything now I want to have an automatic formula because otherwise I will have to do this I say okay I need this one and this one is two so it's not very efficient if you want to do a dynamic way you can use index match method if you already know that otherwise what you can use is I put a number at the top 3 four five manually and this is the the colum number for my V cap and instead of doing three like this I replace by the number of the top okay tack I do like this great now what I need to do I need to lock as well my formula to make sure that I keep at the the row 8 F4 so now I only lock the row four otherwise I'm going to lose my the formula we lose just to keep in mind if I don't do that the number three now is moving like this so I need to add something like this okay so now I locked this one and now I also want to do it for the other column so what we're going to do we're going to lock this as well otherwise going to move okay what's happening right and now we're going to copy and paste here for example to see if it's working yes it's working it doesn't work no yes it's working you see perfect so now you can do like this boom I know you have all your formulas ready with the with the item code and you can just double check one just to make sure it's working water bottle for um months minus 3 so you can see I didn't explain to you before but we have M minus one M minus 2 m minus 3 y this is noral this is MTD month to date and this is the month of my um this is my current month basically okay and this is what this is a Formula that's show me mounts and I'm just go to I just go to the latest date and I just do like this that will just keep me in mind okay this is the the current month I have MTD and then I like to use minus one - 2 minus 3 because then we we don't have to change the name of the colum every time and I do the same for the future okay if you do if you write down the the number of the column with the number of the week or the months you will have to change each time you update the fun it's going to be messy and uh you won't you won't have dynamic uh update so for by doing that I always have a very Dynamic update and I don't need to change anything so it was very important to to tell you that now we have the uh we have the all the average sales I I can do it for more than let's open this and you can see I can do it for the last 24 months if this is too much for you I'm going to do that because I'm going to calculate the trend for the last 24 months I can already tell you that we are not doing this method won't be as accurate so if you think this is too much you can just delete uh you can just delete this uh this tab oh like this you can just delete if you think that your file is too slow and we can use it later okay so just to let you know we have last 24 months of sales I deleted too many months I'm going to do like this data op group you can also group and ungroup like this and I'm going to add like this Tri right and now I'm going to just check water bottle to see if it's working water and I have 1 1 080 and 2 478 one and 248 so my formula is working great I know we do have the last 12 months of History dynamically with po query what we're going to do we're going to go to the left and what is my uh what is my average and we do equal average and we select the last one month we never select the current month why because the current month is not complete so it will you will not have an accurate like you won't have the accurate Trend because you have like if you only the 10 of the months you don't have the full month so the average won't be will be too low so you do like this average great and you can check if you have any problem you can see that we have a problem so to remove this problem why because we don't have any data no to remove that we're going to add a formula called if error if error then zero and by having that we have the average for 12 months and I did the same for six months you can see I did the same for 6 months for 3 months for two months and for 1 month okay perfect so we did we have all of this and in the next episode I'm going to tell you what to do with this uh average sales months how to do a selector and how to correct
okay so now we do have the average sales 12 months quantity 6 months 3 months and 2 months and I just wanted to make a pause on this uh on this course because maybe uh I'm already going too fast for you and I just wanted to to make sure that uh we are we are going fast enough but not too fast as well know that you have this forast 56 you could also you could also select one this one this one and this one if you go on the right on my file for now we have a very uh advanced formula why because I'm going to I'm I'm going to add the seasonality the correction I'm going to do override Etc but you can just delete at the beginning this is my basically this is the forecast we're going to use and this is another forecast that we're going to compare to see which one is the best when we want to optimize parameters for example and find the best model for all the products but let's keep it simple at the beginning if you if you think it's already enough for you to start just press equal so this is M plus 0 what is plus Z is your current month your current month is the month of August 8 and this is connected to your the level tab so it's equal to this value and each time you're going to update the file it's going to move to September October etc etc so what you can do as the first forecast you can just press equal go to the left select this one clack and now you have the average 12 mounts and you just copy and paste formula like this right click formula boom so now you do have your first forecast with the level you can just create the graph insert like this so you have to select data and switch rows and columns and now you have your first forecast okay so you can see the forecast for your next 12 months it's a flat forecast average forecast which is great clack you can see the based on the model it's a very different value and this is already a very good start you know if you think like in the next episode we're going to add more complexity we're going to add selectors we're going to correct with avability with seasonality we're going to add Trends but maybe it's already good enough for you because you have nothing and you know what applying just an average 12 months plus seasonality will be already a very good start for your forecast than just trying to do everything for now and maybe it's already too complex so I just wanted to to make a pause have a look on the next episode and if you think you are ready for that use use them but maybe you don't even track have ability and it's already too much for you you can already start from this and just apply your seasonality and you will have already an amazing and automating automatic forecast so that is for the quick introduction also if you feel like you don't want to use 12 months you can just change the formula and say you know what I want the six month forus oh I want the six month's forecast and now you can just copy and paste the formula and boom you're going to update all your products automatically every single products will have an automatic forecast from that so I recommend by default to use 12 months because you don't have any seasonality impact we're going to talk about this later and in the next episode I'm going to tell you how to create this selector then you can pick the average sales you want for your forecast
okay my friends so now we do have the average quantity uh for the last 12 months for 6 months for 3 months here up for two months and for 1 months why I am doing that because maybe you want to select not 12 months but six months for example if you have a new product let's let's check new new launch for example this one this one you have only like 3 months eory right no four month history you have 360 so you saw 360 the first time and then you said 39 33 and 15 and you may say you know what I don't know if I want the full average of that so the first thing you you have to be careful is like you can see there is a no there is a no why because if I put zero if I had if I had zero here control like this my average for 12 months will be 34 right if I do like this now my average is 112 So before going to the selector I I really wanted to highlight the fact that if you don't have if your product is not for sale the best will be if I go back to level T tac tac you can see there is a no displaying here in my pivot table and it's just the fact that if you don't have any information so if I go back to my data set sales quantity you have few will say okay if there's no information it's going to be blank which is great blank is great and few IP that will just not display anything or they will put zero if you have a zero it's going to be challenging because you don't know if you're selling or it's if it's out of stock or if it's not selling at all but if you have this information try to keep it in your in your file because then it's going to be very different for your average the average is the most important thing for your forecast your level and if your level is not correct it's going to be problematic so what you can do and I think I put this here like you can see there is a the pivot table option right click on your pivot table option pivot table option and you have four empty cells this options into what is it layout and format yes for empty celles show and you can decide by default I think it's Z it's nothing or zero don't put zero if you put zero it's going to do like this you will have zero so you won't be able to do any a specific average so what you should do is just put any later so I'm going to pay no but any kind of later then when you do that you have no yes for example this no and when you select for example this three the average would be 36 you see there is no difference between selecting this and this so the first option is to do that if you can in your data set is to remove all the blank by your later then when you do uh an average you are not considering this as zero otherwise the v c would just say oh this is zero okay because for for V cup your formula will be like zero if you don't do that so you could also say if equal if equal blank then but no just put any kind of letter that you don't have this problematic Aver cells that's the first option what you could do as well and it's it's kind of manual but you could say you know what for new products I only want to keep the last three months of sales so you could change the formula manually or you could add a selector to say you know what for this one because this is a new launch I'm going to use the the last three months only and you can see oh my uh average s is moving right my a is moving and if you say you know what I don't even want to to take the three 360 because it was maybe the launch of the product you can say you know what I want to have two months only I know my average is 30 31 something yeah because we don't take the current months and we do have a correction but I'm going to tell you that after so the idea is really to have an automatic selector for some specific case you want to have the option to change the average this is a bit more risky because you you give more power and room for mistakes if you forget to change the selector but in specific case for example for new launch or for very very you know for example you have a very short collection and you don't want to take the last 12 months you need to be more reactive that's a selector I like to give as an option only for very specific um case and you can always filter here to see okay what what are the different options and that's what we're going to do there is also another options you can select the new new and when you do new my option is you can set up a manual value for example if you say uh 20 then my average demand now is 20 otherwise if you select 12 it's going to move back to this value so that's another option for example if you have a new product we're going to get back to this in the new product section you don't have any history and you want to create an an artificial average sales you can do it by selecting new so how do we do this selector that's a really cool feature I really like and we going to do it now um by doing that so I'm going to remove that you just have to select your data like this you go to data then you go to this one data tool data validation and you can select the source you can see that my source is just at the top so I will have to click on this plus I think yes and you can see we have this plus great so you just have to put the list of what you want to display you create again you go back to data list data validation you select list this one and you select this one great then you press okay and you can just copy and paste the formula to the down and then we have this of course if you change 12 by you can do I don't know seven months which doesn't make sense for me you get you have no seven months here and if you if you tap down six months six months it will block you okay so that's a good thing also to guarantee the more you have selectors the less you have room for mistake we're going to get back to to secure the file after okay so we go back to six months and know where do we have the six months you can just you have this option and now we're going to back to the average G so it looks very complex when you see all of this but at the end let's remove the end of this formula this is the end of the formula we're going to explain after I I think I have two missing no I need to close one t t nice so now I remove I I remove the the complex formula and at the end this is the same when I do this I have my six months perfect when I do this I have my three months etc etc and the formula look at it it's just a lot of if so if my average selector is equal to W say. new then I just take the value in this empty cell then I do another if if it's equal to 12 months then I take the value of 12 months if it's equal to six month then I take the value of this so it's just a lot of if if if if if just to say at the end that if you select this one you get this one Etc and if it's a new one you just select this specific value so this is and then I just said also if if there is a problem a ref problem then I just take also the last months quantity that's just one specific options I had at the end if I don't have any any information for the product so that's what I did in this specific episode is how to create this selector this is clearly not mandatory uh but this is a feature that you could add if you want to give more room to uh to change your forecast without having to changeing manually because you could also keep only one and for this specific item you should say oh you know what I'm going to change the selection and just do not M M12 but M M6 by doing that there will be a no M6 like this by doing that it will be much more manual that's why I prefer to standardize by a selector and but it's a to you if you feel this is the the right time and you have the level of maturity with Excel and your team to use it
in this episode my friend I wanted to go back to a different way to forecast the average sales not globally but per number of clients or number of stores so this is for example one something I was using when I was working for decathlon it's a very large sply goods company and when we were forecasting the the average sales it was not the global average sales it was it was per store so for example if I take this one just to give you one example I just wanted to talk about it because I had few question about with my members you can say okay I have 31 92 um this is my my average sales but at the end you know what I have 100 stores so I have number of stores if you have a distribution process and I have 100 stores so what is the average per store it's this divided by 100 I can click on 100 okay perfect so we have we do have 32 and you can say okay we have always 100 but then you could forecast you know what my new number of stores new stores number for example your with with the catl we had we had new opening stores so we had for example 10 new stores so we we're going to do this plus 10 new stores it was plus it was 10 2,000 stores at this at the time was a lot of stores plus we have a new distribution of 50 new stores in this specific uh region because we I don't know we for example this region decided to select this kind of product and it was not part of the collection before so we do have now 160 stores and what you're going to forecast at the end is the number of stores and the average sales per store so average per store and you could say okay you know what we're going to keep the same we're going to use 32 as well maybe not maybe you have a reason that smaller store bigger store they're going to sell more and more and your average average sales total average sales total for 12 months will be this times the number of store ah cannot click damn it I really don't like excess sometimes just fact you cannot click equal this times this so your new average sales per this is the new average T we keep the same you could do like for example 35 so now your new average sales monthly total before was 312 and now it's 5 5,600 why because we have much more store than before and we increase a bit the new average poor so this is a way to work as well I just wanted to give you this example I'm not going to keep this example uh but but instead of doing a global average forecast you could also work like this if you have big change in your distribution in the range selection of your products because you have your own private Network or maybe you have new opening as well so this is an example I hope this is clear for you and maybe it's not it's not relevant but I wanted to explain that to you as well
in this episode my friend we're going to talk about negative values so I didn't cover this topic while we were cleaning the data but I I feel it was uh important to come back to this and so what are negative values in the the original file sales quantity I can see that there is for example values minus 9 so when you're going to do this why do why do you have minus 9 quantities it could be a problem from your it invoice like Department you didn't get the invoice properly or maybe something something wrong happen in the system it could be a return of your product or it could be what else could be return or it could be maybe destruction but at the end you have to you have to question yourself do you want to remove this negative values or not the risk of having negative values is you may have negative average sales or average level and then average uh forecast as well do you want to have this or not you have to question yourself so if you feel this return are normal and should be like you are selling 10 and you have one return so it's nine I want to keep the nine number okay that's okay for you but if you feel you want to moove them you need to have an automatic process as well for that okay so how we going to do that this is not mandatory but this is important to think about it so what I suggest is you do the same with your company and you check if you have any for example negative average uh we don't have any negative because I already clean but maybe check your last 12 if you have any negative values sometimes these values are crazy like I could see like minus 2,000 or minus 3 million products and you have to be careful to to clean all of that so how do how do we clean that the first option is to go back to the V cup and this V cup to say basically uh if so you go back to my V cup you say if video C is less than zero then zero otherwise V look up oops zero so that's that's that's an option and that will remove automatically all your zero the problem is like I don't like this formula for me super heavy super super heavy so there is another option I wanted to show to you if you go back to for example my sales here you can do it automatically with power query so I think I did here I replace my uh if my sales origin are less than zero then zero and we're going to do it uh I'm going to do it again slowly because it was a bit too fast for you so I'm not sure I did it for sales quantity no I didn't do it oh I'm going to use it for my old file I don't know if you remember we had this file call forecasting start I need to close this one not going to break my current file t t t okay so in this one we do have the sales in value and quantity and you can see that we do have negative value so this is the file we're using to clean data you and I want to remove all of them all the negative in quantity so what we're going to do we're going to go to data cism connection first you need to enable content sales quantity great and what I'm going to do now I'm going to do so you have two options you can remove the lines but if you if you do that for example you could say number filter more than greater than zero so if you do that zero you're going to remove all the lines so you won't have even the information of the of the product so I don't really like this one because you're going to lose information as well what I want is I want to replace so how to replace you're going to do like this you cannot do it this way you can remove empty but you cannot do it this way so what you have to do you go to so you can do the replace value here if you go to transform the program is replace value is you need to do it one by one you cannot do like you have to do minus one and replace and it's going to replace all of it automatically but you need to find all the different negative values so the most efficient one is to go to add column then you create a conditional column you can call it a new quantity or quantity new and you select the colon sales quantity so if my say Quantity is less than zero then I put zero otherwise don't forget this one you need to add the say Quantity that was before so you do like this okay now you have the new one you can delete this one you can rename this one rename sales quantity and now let's give a try if it's working or not you can check here directly do we have any one you need to learn more there is no more negative value great you can go to file close and load you can refresh yeah you can you have to refresh this one let's see if it's working no there is no more negative value and now when we select you can see that there is no negative value only 0 3 6 9 and 12 good job so that's the way to do it congratulation and you can apply it to your file if you use powerquery if you don't use power query you can do uh the if method but it's going to slow down your file and I like to have an automatic process for that as well
okay my friends so now we clean the negative value there is another topic on the other side let's take one example so let's take the water bottle this water bottle oop let's Zoom this water bottle you can see when you look at the numbers there is a big one 7,000 7,000 so when I look just copy and paste go to the skew dashboard and you can copy and paste this value here it's it was already copy for me uh you can already generate I'm generating this graph automatically this is Magic maybe we're going to cover this later but at the end is good to visualize the graph if you don't have this at least just do like this to see that there is a problem insert okay so you do like this select data and you in switch row colums and when you see the numbers you can see there is a big O ler where we call it ler is like something that is much more than the average what the problem with that is you're going to impact a lot your average because of one or two values which is it looks different and when you can see my comments you can see hey we sold 5,000 quantity to a club in June ha this is the reason so it's very important to have a comment section if you can or maybe to have a place where you have all the commercial information like like exceptional commercial information and in this one we can see directly in the file but this color is automatic why because we're going to correct this value automatically how we going to do that I'm going to teach you or you can do it manually in your directly in your sales quantity uh file which not which can be quite painful so command maybe what is the data point so if you have ANP you maybe have the option that you can correct the the history correcting the sales history or Dem hisory or consumption history can be very important for the future we did it at the macro level when we're checking for example uh the financial forecast I don't know if you remember I one point we remove this Peck for seasonality and you can correct manually if you have only few products or if you want to do it at the macro level but at the micro level it can be quite painful so you could do it only for the most important product you could change the value directly in your data source file or you can create another file just with the change of sales correction or you could do it automatically and that's what we're going to do now so if I go back to this file T tac tac I'm moving my I'm moving maybe a bit too fast you can see there is a sales and there is a sales correction and this sales correction was done automatically the initial sales was 11,799 and the correction is 77 517 so to beest in my file already corrected this value is already corrected initial value was 11 almost 12,000 quantities which is a lot okay so how did I correct that you can see in the graph you had the initial one and the correct one so I didn't correct all of it I just remove half of the value basically how do we do that let's go back to level and in level you see I have more information on the on the left you have the standard deviation which will give you the the average gap between the average something like that if I want to explain you have the variation that we are not going to use now just the standard deviation divided by the average of the last 12 months and what you could start maybe is like what is the minimum value and what is the maximum value right the minimum value for this product is six the maximum value is 39 and the average is 20 and I'm using I'm using the last two years for this specific example you can use 12 months or two years it's up to you in this specific one I use two years okay so then what I like to see is like what is the ratio between the average and the max in this specific case it's only two 2.8 but you have you have example for example this one 6.5 6.5 means like there is a big difference between the average and at one point boom I'm going to 18 so that's a big difference so what I recommend to you is to calculate the standard deviation we're going to use it later and also to have an idea what is the minimum what is the average and what is the max just to see if you have a big variation or not in your uh in your profile you can also do that you can see that most of the time the um the ratio mean Max there is a strong strong correlation between the variation which is just the standard deviation divided by the average and the ratio min max they're quite similar the bigger is this one the bigger is this one as well not completely correlated because the average you could have one point or you could have multiple points that's what we're going to see just after then you go back to your base and in this base I created an automatic program to correct your sales history so you click on the plus here tck and you can see I just V look up all the information from the level standard deviation variation Etc to the base so it's just a vook up where I get standard deviation going to zoom a bit for you standard deviation V mean average and Max and what we can see for example is the ratio mean Max first if you take for example only the biggest one for example more than um you can see that all these one are kind of pro problematic if I look at this kit bike and I put it into my screw dashboard very useful up you can see that we had it was very stable and boom and boom another time so we have to correct the information once again so it's very useful at least to have this ratio then if you want to highlight what are the biggest problem you can see Al the varation is very high more than 100% that will help you to really focus on the main like problematic maybe maybe they're not problematic but they will really help you to see what's the most instable products and if you have to clean something or not so I'm going to unzoom now and know the question is but how do you clean them so or you do it manually based on the the past sales you could say oh you know what I had 3,000 before so I'm going to put three four 5,000 so you could do manually you could also maybe remove the exceptional sale for one specific customer so you say oh you know what my initial sales what for example I'm going to go back to this one you say like we had U 5,000 of from a club so I'm going to do 12,000 minus 5,000 so I will have 7,000 units you could do like this or you could do automatically and what I'm going to do with you now is I'm going to use aate a maximum value allowed for for my sales history and what is the formula of that you have multiple way to do it but the one I'm going to use is this one so I'm going to use the average of the last two years plus two * my standard deviation so this is a very classic way to do it the two parameters so I'm going to use the average plus twice the standard deviation the standard deviation is the the more you have variation the more the standard deviation will be high so at the end for this specific one the average is 3,100 plus 2 * this so my maximum value I'm I'm going to allot for my level calculation will be 5,696 but you could change the parameter to 2.5 and I will increase the I mean increase the the possibility to have a highest value versus the average but I would say that most of the time I like to use two and uh in the future we're going to you can optimize this parameter by tracking the accuracy in the past but start with two and then you have this value and what you're going to do now in your V cup so that's why my V cup is a bit longer I just say if my value is more than 56 96 then I'm going to use this value if it's less then I'm going to use the current V cup from my database so for this one there is no change but for this specific one because my value was more the light one this one was more so if we go back to this one my initial value was 7662 so because I have more I'm going to use the maximum value allow 5 696 that's why we have a difference between uh these uh two so that's it we have the correction automatically and then because I like to make it fancy I put a conditional formatting and the condition formatting if you select that's why also the file can be a bit slow for you you don't need to have this one automatically you go to manage rules and it was this one and in my conditional rules I say if my cell is equal or greater than my Mac Max then I put a specific color so all of this this is just an automatic condition to just to show me oh this is not this is not the real value this one was corrected this one was corrected this one was corrected and then you have a more visible way to see that but it can be quite heavy for the the Excel file because you have a lot of conditional formatting so if you feel this is too uh too slow for you maybe use it maybe just for the last few months but at least you have a visibility of what's Happening uh in your file so that's it for the correction automatic correction I like to use it a lot I'm not the only one in the industry to to use it and in the next episode we're going to keep improving this automatic level forecast for improving your accuracy
in this episode my friend we're going to talk about demon and sales because this is not the same topic or demon and consumption if you have a a factory so let's take this example and let's have a look at this example you have you have quite low you have like this peak and you have the the graph about avability and when we see on the graph you can see that we have a lot of weak not weak months with no avability and the question is when you do the average sales of the last 12 month I can see 31 do you think this is the correct level that you should have or maybe you are missing opportunities of selling more maybe your average level is not 30 but maybe 40 or 60 so that's why I wanted to to talk about that most of the companies in the world they use their sales as the demand but the real demand most of the time if you have stock out is much higher and the question is how to correct this this topic we're going to talk about it in few epis and also my friend Mario from Amazon will give you his his point of view but what I will do like instinctly to say you know what maybe I should do more if I just do the average of this product when I have avability I have 62 so I would do like this I will add 60 oop I will add control t t tack I will add for example 60 and know my new average is not 31 6 61 you see so that's something I would like to do but maybe not as strong because maybe you didn't sell the products so the the challenge is really to find a good way between correction but not over correcting because maybe you also sold other products in your Ranch so the idea is really to find the balance between correction automatic correction but not crazy correction that will amplify too much your forecast so now let's go back about the principle of service and how to track the service so how to track the service whatever you have a fashion retail store like Zara or you are selling milk in the supermarket or you have an Amazon business like this one or you have a distribution business Factory or even you sell or distribute raw materials like I was I was working for the copper wire industry for for a year now you can track the service everywhere from the supplier on the factory to the transport to the warehouse to the transport the the outburn transport to your customer you can track the service everywhere and you have how do track the service I did a lot of um videos and Topic in my new my program called SM analytics we talk a lot about kpis but just to give you a quick overview when you track the service between Sellers and customers or suppliers you have the quantity or the volume you have the quality and you have the lead time so this is the three pillars when you track service the most important for us right now is about quantity or volume because that's the one we want to assess to then adjust if you want to forecast so do you have two ways to track you have multiple way but two main ways to track the service you have the service rate or the availability rate and I'm going to give you back again the example of cocaa Coca-Cola selling to Walmart the biggest supermarket chain in the US and when I take the example of Coca-Cola they have retail stores and they also have their website when you look at the the supply chain when we track Coca-Cola and Walmart maybe you already know this example you can accelerate this video but just to give you an idea the factory we Supply the main Distribution Center in the US and they're going to ask quantities qualities and lead time that's the three main pillars we collect the supply in full on time and for example I want 100,000 quantities they're going to deliver 90,000 quantities on time with the rightly time so we're going to have 9 % of service we call it cyot then in the warehouse you have this very simple indicator that you can also Implement do you have the product yes or no I don't have it 0% I have it 100% so you can do it for your 10,000 products in your company maybe you can also Implement an ABC analysis then you focus on your avability on a code B code and C code and at the end you have avability then you have the the store the Walmart supermarket is going to ask you know what I also need a service and we call it the same one that is almost the same instead of Supply INF full on time we call it delivery in full on time or on time in full for o this is at the end of time this is a service and this time they want 1,000 bottles and you're going to deliver 800 so your service is going to be 80% the problem like in the store you don't know in advance if I'm going to buy Coca-Cola I don't drink Coca-Cola to be honest uh I try to be careful with sugar only natural sugar for me uh but at the end yeah if if you need two quantity you don't have order in advance so you cannot track the service like the the service rate you can only track the avability in your store do we have product yes 100% I don't have product 0% then you can do the same in the in the website you are not going to order in advance in the website so you cannot track like an another service a service to another you can only track the availability of the catalog in the website and you can only say okay I have 100 product and Which percentage of these products are available or not so we say 0% or 100% And this is based on the availability on your Warehouse okay so that was just a quick introduction if you want to go further about this topic I have the full method called SM analytics that you probably already know and in the next episode we're going to check in Excel or to calculate your service or to implement and or to correct your sales
okay now my friend we're going to go back to Excel and I'm going to go back to how to calculate the avability rate the way you calculate your service will really impact the way you want to correct it we're going to talk about it later also with my friend from Amazon Mario so we do have first the avability this is if you have nothing start with availability you have 10 products you just say if they're active or not if they're discontinued you don't want to track the availability you need to get the available stock which is different from the physical stock for example you have 10 products in your warehouse but already five are booked to one of your customer and it's ready to be packed and and chaps for this one for me for me they're not available they're already allocated to One customer so your real availability in terms of stock is not 10 it's 10 minus minus 5 it's five okay so just to keep this in mind if you don't have this information it's okay just take what you have don't don't overthink the complexity if you don't have the information at the end you have the available stock and the availability rate is just if my product is active and then if I have zero then 0% if I have more than zero 100% I've talked about this topic many times I'm sure you know what I'm talking about and then the total availability is the average of all your information except for this one because this product is not available or maybe is not for sale at this specific time so what I did per product you could do the same product you could be the product one for all of them but it could be for months 01 months 02 and it could be the same for a long period of time okay and then you will do okay at one point it was not for sale but my availability for this product for the last 10 months was 63% okay so that's a very easy way to start you can also do an ABC analysis we going to do it later to combine because it's more important to have avability on your top seller than the low seller that's the easy one the most advanced one is what we call the fear rate fear rate or Service rates I'm going to hide this I'm going to hide this one because they not relevant for the for what we're going to talk about but this time you have the product and you have the quantity ordered and the quantity supplied okay and at the end you do the difference between ordered and supplied you do the difference between these two and you have a percentage but what is more important as well is how many did you miss like you ordered 200 and you supply zero so you miss 200 quantity right this is what we could call as well the back order and know the question of this is how can you get this information how can you get this information from your maybe your customer service team because most of the time you always don't have the information or uh it's not recorded correctly or we you update the quantity when for example you get an order of 1,000 quantity you say oh and only have 500 so I'm going to update my system and we lose track what was the the initial demon so this is more complex to to get access to this information the goal of forecasting spare is not to talk too much about kpis in this way you can go further with SM analytics if you want but I didn't think about the process and think about do you have an information I can use today in my company that could correct my for example my average sales on or Not My Level to improve my forecast accuracy do should I include my back order into my next month's forecast uh that's one of the solution or I'm going to give you another one just after okay so we do have add the end the field rate is just the total of quantity uh Supply divided by quantity ordered and that's that's it for the introduction of that now if we go back to my file we I'm going to give you one example and then you you have to find your example you can see that we have avability this avability is coming from a file I get from this company I Will Survive I love the name of the company and it's very simple so the company did the job for me perfect and you can see one it's available zero it's not available if you want to know the availability for the last 12 months for this product or like take this one the avability is the average of this point so it's it could be percentage like this up and the availability is 50% okay so now I have this information and what I'm going to do I'm going to close this one we're going to do the same transformation that we did before for the other tab I'm going to use power query to move into vertical format so into Data queries and connection I've done this multiple times you can do it one more time if you want but you just click on avability Tech and I just did the importation like we did before for sales stock no sales price and sales in value and just to keep in mind so we did uh if you never done if you skip my previous episode I hope not you you go to get data from file Excel ta and then you go to the the Excel forecasting data I take the avability and I do all the the step one oh we got let's do it again unable to connect okay so I have a program with my share folder today it's a challenge okay you see now it's working we go to this transform data of course the challenge is not to import the table but how to get the table right then then we go to use first row as either I done this before so then we're going to unpivot because I want to have like the s a vertical format we I teach you that in how to transform data we're going to go to transform no unpivot colums the other columns we're going to switch that to date this into value we can keep this we can rename date and availability okay so now we have this our typ is ready make sure you have the item code at the number format and then we can load the table close and load the table close and load two as a table new worksheet perfect so now we have the availability per product we have it's linked automatically so we can connect directly and in the next episode what we're going to do I'm going to teach you how to connect this to my base and how to adjust my avability to have uh a correction of My Level based on the level of availability of my product
okay so now we're going to connect the avability we have here to the base and we're going to adjust the avability of my product and also it's cool to have it in your file it's always good to know what's happening so first we're going to do we're going to reshape this because what I want to have I want to have the last 12 months of avability so we're going to do exact exact same process that we did for the sales we're going to do a p a pivot table based on the last 12 months with the latest months on the left okay so if you don't remember we're going to do it together to be honest I don't need this table if you don't like Pro query once again you can use the same format and do a pivot tble from this format or you can just do insert pivot table from external data source choose a connection I'm going to use my avability to this time new work sheet by the way I can just to keep in mind you don't need this table so you can remove it by going to data coron connection and you can just load two and you can just do a p pivot table report directly from this one you don't even have to do what I did before you do like this okay bye perfect it's just to give an example I don't need this query you can remove the this data in your file I don't need this one one is just for your information so now when you have this what I'm going to do I'm going to do the item code I'm going to do the avability here and I'm going to do the date I need to remove always all this information T tac tac great and what I need to do now is just newest to oldest now the latest one I insert two columns and the first one is the average we're going to do the last 12 months why because most of my forecasting model use the last 12 months and I feel this is relevant for me but you could do like one colon for 12 months maybe one colon for the last months or the current months that could be also something interesting for your tracking if you use if you use it for inventory I will also display on your base the last the current month avability but for accuracy correction it makes more sense to have longer period okay so now I have my average average 12 months ta I know you can see the average and you can also now we're going to just V up so for that I need a link why like the sales before I cannot V up from this from Colon c to colon B I need to have something from this side so I do like this and now I can V up from this one to this one okay so now I have this number I can go back to my base and what I just did was I just look up my item code and my to get my availability from the tab I just created very simple V look up avability bum bum bum now I have this information great what I'm going to do is that my friend what I'm going to do with that we're going to add some give you some space in my Excel T okay so we have now the avability and how you going to correct and use this number for example 75% right and you can see in my formula if you look at my formula let's not talk about the doality coefficient we're going to talk it later it's 100% so it doesn't change for this one but you can see that I have my avability here there is a Col called avability correction and if you like look at the comment average sales correction if stock out 2% of stock means 1% of Miss sales we cap correction from 30% stock up to avoid extreme correction no correction if new average sales selected okay so it's just to explain to you that at the end uh we uh my principle and this is just one principle Le and you can use your own principle is I say you know what if I have 50% well let's take another example if I have 50% of 50% of avability I'm going to increase my average sales by 25% so that's this parameter I'm going to to 50% of my stock out will be added into extra sales for my average sales okay why 50% it's just by experience why not 100% if you change the parameter you say 100 that will I will use the same level I don't like to do one for one why because um first of all you don't calculate the avability necessar every hour so you're not losing always sales uh also you have some cannibalization if you have stock out on one product you it's going to be maybe transferred to another product so if you correct all your stock out you may have way too much inventory and you you may increase your you your forus a bit too much so I don't like the ratio one to one I prefer the 50% rule but then you can optimize this parameter later by tracking the accuracy in the past like we did with the the previous chapter so I just like to keep it very simple also very simple to explain to my team they don't look for Perfection and then you can optimize this parameter later there is also another rule that I like to use if if my availability is less than 30% I'm not correcting more than 30% basically so if we cap 30% the minimum stock out to avoid extreme correction why because if otherwise if I don't cap let's say I have 0% of avability you see I'm capping to 35 so I would say it's like having 30% it would be it would give me the same result because when you have z0 on the long period I don't want to overcorrect very very low um average sales so that's my own decision you could go to 10% you could even go to 0% if you go to 0% and you have 0% uh you will increase your average s by 50% that's another optimization but I don't want to I prefer to correct but not crazy because at the end this is just an adjustment and for me uh this is the parameters I use but once again you can optimize them if you feel this is not strong enough for you but I recommend to start slow and based on multiple example you can adjust directly because we're going to use this rule for all the products I don't want to have something too strong but if you do it for specific group of products you can maybe even adjust manually uh this value for specific group of products okay so that's the rule and when you look at the formula if my avability is more than 30% then I do one minus the avability times 50% and if it's less we just consider that the avability was 30% minimum for the correction so at the end I have a percentage of avability Correction 25% in this case and my average demand I'm going to do if you look at we talk about this formula before and I'm going to just do an addition percentage of one plus my correction so for example my average was 31 I'm going to add 25% of it so at the end the 31 become 38 okay so I hope this is clear for you guys this is just one example very simple but we're going to see that with Amazon after sometimes correcting over correcting the the forecast with Stockard can be very complex so you you may have to use machine learning but sometimes Simplicity Simplicity sorry is the most is the most sophisticated solution for you
all right Mario so before I was explaining how toh simply correct your level of sales or Demand with your stock out and and shortage no I want to I want to see with you does Amazon is correcting as well the the stock out to improve the the focus accuracy or not absolutely absolutely it's a it's it's critical uh we we have an algorithm this is specifically designed for basically recreating a demand if availability was 100% okay it's called we call it availability corrected demand okay and then the availability corrected demand is the input of the true forecasting model okay okay so can you give so it looks very cool but in the details like for example I have this product I can see I have some like shortages and basically what you're going to do you're going to do you're going to correct you're going to create another forecast with another demand another demand demand for yes for example so basically the input is the actual demand it might be zero if you were like a you know availability was 0% for example might be zero uh then it takes the availability rate okay in this case like 0% okay and then it the the result the output for that specific week for the specific product is going to be what demand would have been if you were 100% available okay we can just guess that basically what the algorithm is since this being only two inputs what the algorithm is doing is basically estimating demand based on the previous history of the same product as you were saying before and based on similar comparable products okay okay so for example let's say I have this product with 0% avability I I would say oh okay the the I keep it very simple but I know machine learning is more advanced oh okay the average was I don't know 60 or 70 I'm going to to that will be my demand without shortages and you will you will create this new one and that's the one you're going to use for your focus model it could be based on the same model or based on comparable model let's say you are selling I don't know for soccer ball and you have one in all of stock you have another one that sell twice more and you're going to use the weight and the distribution of this product to to readjust this one and I'm sure the machine learning do this like in a very black box way but if we can INSP if we can get inspiration from this if you don't have this very Advanced model which I never seen except at Amazon to be honest it will be to really really maybe think about correcting if you have big products with a lot of sales maybe think about correcting manually or kind of automatic automatically what I did before but in a more advanced way from comparable model or from the same model and do it it all manually graphically or always different formulas yes precisely yes okay thank you for sharing that and I we see you for another episode
in this episode we're going to talk about the bull weep effect why do I have a cowboy because of the bull whep and this is a a story I like I really like I remember from an amazing Inventory management teacher had in school it was I think the only teacher I remember in supply chain in my master degree his name was aen Miller he was very gave me the paent for for supply chain and he gave me the story about barila um the consumption of pasta in Italy is very flat very consistent like the French for cant and baguette they have the same quantity of pasta every day in their meal and they buy also the same quantity of pasta almost every day okay so this is the consumption of pasta in Italy then they go to the the retailer and the retailer will not buy pasta every minute he selling a Bara brand pasta right so the retailer maybe will do in instead of buying one is's going to buy maybe a box of I don't know 20 or 50 um let's say 50 quantity but not every day or maybe once a day then there was the small wholesaler in the region will say oh he's going to buy not 50 by 5050 he going to buy maybe a pallette of 1,000 box of pasta okay so then you you see you start having this peak that's that created is not buying all the time it's taking even less time to buy then the wholeseller is going to buy it to the distributor and the distributor will buy not 1,000 quantity but maybe 20 or 50,000 quantity with even a bigger variation and then he's going to wait again and then he's going to go to the factory and um when the distributor is going to pass his order it's not going to do it every hour it's going to wait maybe once a month and it's going to ask to the factory give me 1 million box of faster so at the end what we call the bull rip effect is even if the demand is very very stable you can have this amplification the more you have intermediate suppliers in the chain the more you will amplify and you will create dist disturbance in the in the in the the consumption of of product in the orders in the quantity you want to pass so you can see between this curve and this curve there is a huge difference and as as I was working supply chain I could really struggle with this variation for example when I was in in the man manufacturing path I knew the demand was very stable but we were receiving last minute orders with massive quantities and then for two weeks we had zero volume to produce and it was very difficult to anticipate because we had no visibility on that so what is the solution for that and what did this company Barilla to improve that especially from the factory and distributor side they were not forecasting based on the the Expedition from the factory they were forecasting based on the sales to the retailer directly not the consumers because it's not easy to get but from the retailers and they were anticipating their volumes before and after to make sure they had enough capacity in their Factory so this is what we call the bull whip effect very very classic in the supply chain world and to be Hest this is you have many Industries even like funny ones or not funny ones during the pandemic for example the consummation the consumption of toilet pepper is very stable in the world I feel uh but because of U fear fear of missing out um people went to the supermarket and during the last pandemic bought a lot of toet papers but at the end it was just a problem of fear but the the consumption of the client was always the same every day and we have the same question for for this company I just wanted to introduce this example maybe like with Walmart you are not selling every uh the the supermarket Walmart you may have a massive order from Walmart every month of bikes or of closing etc etc and it's it's quite challenging for you to anticipate that and the best way if you want to avoid that is really to focus not on the orders from Walmart but on the sales directly in the the stores of Walmart okay so instead of going your forecast based on what is leaving your distribution center or factory really try to get the information from Walmart and what I was doing when I was a supply chain director in Australia I was giving money to my clients then they were selling me their sales history not from not buying history but sell history from their clients and it was for me very relevant I was not doing it on all my products I was doing it especially for my new launch or for for products no visibility because it was not very consistent and I could see in advance because sometimes I was shipping 10,000 quantity of lipstick I was selling lipstick but it was one big order but I didn't know if in that store it was I was selling 1,000 per week or 100 per week and having this information I could anticipate the next orders of my clients just by having more information uh of the the end of my sulation so the conclusion of the bu effect is always try to get as as much information information as close as possible from your consumers the the final consumers not the B2B one but the final one and the closer you get to that the easier it will be to predict your future sales and you could even do your forecast and for example your average level and average sales not based on your the orders you receive but based on the consumer from the the end of your supply chain so I I hope you like this example for uh for example like in my specific example in Australia I could not do it for all my clients so I was always doing it only for the top three customers and they were representing more than 70 70% of my sales and then I was just doing like um like a multiplication to say okay if I if I have visibility on even 40% I could do say okay so I have 60% missing and I will consider that I have the same Trend okay so that's an introduction for the bip try to do it at least with one customer at the beginning even if it represent 20% see if you can see more visibility and if you can improve the process and if this is the case try to duplicate this to the rest of your clients or at least try to do like a hypothesis that if you have 40% of your visibility just add an extra 60% of the same value uh to decide what would be uh the real demand from your real customer from the retail or from the the end of the chain that you are supplying
all right so in the previous chapter we're talking how to define the right level of sales per month or per week whatever is your your business could be consumption or demand or sales and at the end we had this number so I just want to get back to this we have this average demand okay that we use to correct with o layers we remove like the the specific o layers we also adjust with the avability rate and we uh we have at the end this number I'm also doing like what we call deseasonalization so we're going to remove seasonality it's only the case when you select for example 6 months you're going to you're going to change this parameter but we're going to see that later it's going to be a a bit more advanced with the seasonality chapter but now we have this number 56 okay great so now let's put it into the chart and you have two kind of forecast you have the forecast ABC this is my spicy forecast and you have another forecast that I'm going to use and the idea is really to compare two different forecasts and what you can do just to have an idea to understand what we did before the the initial forus we have for now is the average demand corrected so the average demand okay okay we do like this and now we do just like this let's see if it's working right click boom so now we have always the same value for every product and this is very similar to the forecast we had in the forecasting model when we're doing where is my forecast yeah when we had a very flat forecast for the average 12 months this time we corrected by layers availability so it's much more advanced but this is a this is a flat forecast the thing is maybe you have a trend maybe your your business is growing as you can see at the global level we can see that we are growing we technically we're supposed to grow and the ambition for for this year is to grow by 10% so what is missing in this forecast today is there is no growth and that's what we're going to do in uh this chapter we're going to talk about Trends and how to connect Trends or to connect the level and the trends to what like if your if your category is increasing or to increase uh the volume per month and if the category is declining for example the BMX bicycle category is declining as you can see in this graph you can see the electric bike are going up and the BMX this one are going down so you want also to consider what is the the trend of your category or subcategory we're going to talk about it uh in the in the next epon and how to integrate that in a way that you can also connect with your uh commercial forecast or financial forecast so get ready for that we have the we have the foundation to start and now we're going to start forecasting with the trend
okay so now let's do the trend forecast so to keep in mind what we were doing in the previous chapter about how to choose the right model we had multiple way to calculate the trend we had the three different formulas we had the manual formula with the the slope and intercept ax plus b we had the automatic focus with the trend formula and we had what we call the focus linear focus at the end we have the same value so what we're going to do first we're going to do a Trend per product and I I'm going to see you that it's not it's not very efficient sometimes so what we're going to do you can see we have at the top I'm going to open this okay so you have these numbers we can also open this oops not this one this one yeah perfect so now you can see we have all I have my data sorry I'm going to use the last two years why only two years because before that it was the pandemic and it was a bit a bit messy but if you want you can also add more sales history it's going to be quite heavy for your file to be honest if you have a lot of products and if you even work per week it's going to be even more so I would suggest to have at least one or two years if possible two years and you you you can see a trend for more than because sometimes on one specific here you can see that something is not going up or down in the very like it could be just a cycle effect and not um not a one one versus another year effect so at the end to to do the forecast we need to have numbers period numbers 1 2 3 4 5 6 until 24 we have 24 period in the past keep in mind that this label are all um like this m minus one means months the latest months this is the MTD the month to date and the current month is 8 this is August and how do I get this this is a formula from months from the level for so basically I'm doing equal months from My Level Tab and in this level tab I'm just getting this data this L latest months and that give you the number eight okay so why do I have this number because I don't want to put if I put specific date each time I'm going to update my file is going to crash it's going to change I will have to change the label and is won't going to be dynamic for you so at the end you keep it very simple m- one until nus 24 and we're going to do the same the future as you can see M plus 0 this is the current month so this is the forecast of August you can see this is also the the same number why because this one is not complete so we're going to do this the forecast of the current mod and then the M plus one n plus2 etc etc okay so how to do the TR of this we need numbers in the past like we did the period number 1 2 3 4 5 until 24 and we also need to continue the like 25 26 27 to do this forecast if I go back to my forecasting model this is the same period that you can see just here if you want to do a linear forast you need to give the information to the formula that you have X number of period for that so I'm going back to my file and I'm going to know you forget about this formula we're going to do equal Trend oh no let's do the forecasting forecasting linear first you you need for the X so we're going to take the x is 25 then the non Ys are the quantity in the past so we're going to select this the good thing as well we already SE we already collected with o lier so which is pretty good for the you can see the Android uh 2 33 is already correct it so you don't have you won't have the problem uh of all layers because we already fixed that before and then we need to select the period in the past great no that's not this one that's the one okay Enter so now we have this value and now you can duplicate this value the only thing you have to be careful is to lock this this and this you have to lock the row yes right and I do like this let's see if it's working oops what's happening here okay interesting okay so it looks like it's working and now let's give a try between this one and this one insert let's do like this up so right click select data and switch colum so this is my average forecast right I have my average forecast I can change the name edit average 12 months cool now I want do you have another one add we're going to call it trend and the value at this one tick great so now we do have have some weird display on my graph what it's happening H it didn't save sorry for that Trend okay okay maybe I press consel okay so now you can see you have two different Fus I'm going to hide this up you have the average and you have the trend so it looks like okay if you are growing that would be nice to have something growing right but sometimes the value are a bit weird look at that this one minus 50 4 - 100 - 145 what the is going on sorry for the so we're going to we're going to check this one for example up let's go to the SK dashboard and you can see like this is the forecast I have like it's going down why because this is a new product and you had a massive peek and then it was crashing so it doesn't work for this one that's a big problem because if I have this value I'm going to be completely uh off let's see if you have other problem like this t t yeah I have another negative here minus this one is going to negative value as well so you have a the problem is the trend is like another one you have a very stable one 99999 this one is minus 4 - 7 so if I go to this it's going like this as well so basically the trans start from this and it's just crashing so this is a big uh this is a big topic why because uh the problem with this trend and we we could see that as well when we're checking different models it's working when you have big volumes when but when you have very low volumes and when you have not very consistent volumes it can be super messy and it can give you even NE negative values and that's a big problem I have because I don't want to have this kind of surprise I don't want to check every morning if my focus is going crazy as well so you could also add a a formula that say if my value is less than zero than zero but at the end sometimes the problem the main problem with Trend at the the item level is most of the time I have too much volatility to see a correct Trend and you have also all of stock so it's a lot of work and for me it's not necessarily relevant to have a trend at the the item level what I want is more to have a trend at the category or subcategory level then I have more stability and maybe yes you have some items that will not follow the exact same Trend but at the end I want to give the direction for the entire category and that's what we're going to see in the next episode and I do not recommend to use this forecast linear forecast like this because sometimes especially for low sales and very intermittent product is going to go crazy and I I don't want to have this kind of surprise in my forecast
okay so as explained the previous episode we cannot really relate on Trend per product because of the volatility and the uncertainty and what we're going to do now we're going to go back to this principle but this time we're going to calculate we're going to keep the level at the item level which makes sense if you have one product selling one per month you don't want to to group with a product selling 1,000 per month but for the trend we're going to group we're going to try to to see if we have any Trend per category or even sub category and then I'm going to tell you we're going to do the same with seasonality and the superow for me of the of forecasting of an accurate forast is to mix between very micro and macro information not only for the statistics but also with the commercial information so let's go back to this and you can see in the trend tab I did a lot of trend with my category and subcategory but let's start with a very simple analysis that you should all do when you analyze trend so let's insert a new let's do insert pivot table from external data source choose connection that's the beauty of power query if you don't have power query it's okay just create a simple pivot table new worksheet nice and now what we're going to do we're going to check the category and the sales we're going to do this way cl cl sales here and the date the date dat up going to remove this great and now the sales in value I lost my sales so there is a question let's let's have a look on this in set should I do try in quantity or value that's a really good question right I like to congratulate myself sometimes so we do have this should I do it in quantity or value from my point of view I I prefer to do it in value because at the end we are delivering value to the to the customer and the real question is when you look at your base do you have consistent when you look at this electricity electric bike do you have consist product in your uh in your category if you have very consistent product you can use it's okay if you use like quantity but if you have very different product with very different price one for example if you have a very cheap product for example I don't know very like a maybe you have a bike for bike toys in your bikes bicycle category electric category so one is $5 and the other one are $1,000 or even $5,000 the small small one very chip can really influence the overall category so I like to use the value to compensate that but in the manufacturing industry I can see lot of seasonality with quantity uh so my recommendation is to rest to try and to see if you have big difference with the trend and I will do the same with seasonality later and if you have big difference just take the one more relevant for you okay so in my case I'm going to use value and my category are very stable and it's very important to have consistency in the in your category selection you have to make sure with the product Department with marketing with sales that this name and and category as as homo that as similar the product inside as similar as possible then you don't have big surprise we're going to see that uh with uh summer product and winter product just after so this is my um this is my Trend I would say my Revenue per category and let's have a look for example let's go one by one so let's go for example start with road bike enter okay nice and you do right click you can add a trend line great so now you can see that this trend is going a bit down for the road bike it was going a bit up for the total but for road bike it's going a bit down I'm always using a linear Trend so this kind of work you should do like a global you should take Maybe Al a day or one day just to analyze what are the trend of all your categories to see if there is any positive or negative and if the the real question for me is should I take the overall trend of my whole company or should I divide my Trend per category or even subcategory the road bike is going a bit down let's go to another one let's go to mountain bike the mountain bike is very stable maybe you know what I should remove this peak because I don't like this peak so I'm going to I'm going to add a filter in my tab date year T and now you can see you can select and see you can remove maybe a 2020 that's one option or you can even say you know what I'm going to check only the trend for the last 3 years and now you can see that Mountain Bank are going down interesting let's take another one I like I like this last three years kids bike so kids bike there is a they're going up but there is a weird one with this one so maybe I should remove the last two period to see if there is a positive trend without that so I'm going to remove this two and you can see if I remove these two my trend is going down maybe I should even remove this one we're going to talk about how to clean out layers for a trend category as well later so the keys bag is going down electric bik now the electric bike is going up so that's a very important topic if you check if you take the same trend for all your product you will have you're going to miss opportunity for electric bike and you're going to Overstock for road bike or mountain bike let's give a let's have a look on closing closing is going up as well great and BMX is a disaster it's going completely down so that's why like my first conclusion of this and let's check the last one which was accessories accessories is going up but this one is weird as well so if I remove this one it's pretty flat we have to see if the last few weeks or months are relevant or not so at the end my conclusion of this if I remove all my filter on the category level it will be a mistake if I will use the same trend for all my category because some of them are declining and others are completely um are increasing a lot so my conclusion of that you should have this graphic analysis like me it's much easier to look a graph select the right per the more relevant period as possible maybe you only have two years history this is okay just start with what you have per week or per month and my conclusion after doing this quick analysis is we need to have specific Trend per category but the next question is do we have to go even deeper do we have to go to the subcategory and that's what we're going to see in the next episode
okay my friends so as we can see we have different Trends per category so maybe we need to do Trends per category right but the question is should should I go deeper so I'm going to copy and paste this one I'm going to paste and this one I'm going to remove the category and add the subcategory just below I'm going to do another graph T insert I know have all my subcategory and the question is should I keep my Trend by category or should I go deeper into subcategory so you should do the same with your own value maybe you don't even have any Trend at all and this is okay we're going to talk about it and what I'm going to do now I'm going to check category by category let's start with accessories accessories t Okay sometimes it's lagging a bit because I'm recording on two screen in the same in the same time okay so when we look at elmet it's not easy to read right you have the looks like the water bottle are going up oh turn line but the what is that the locks turn line the locks are going down so it's not easy to read to be honest uh maybe I should remove the water bottle because it's a bit big because of the last we're going to remove the last few amounts okay so you can see for example it's interesting the water bottle are declining the lights looks like they are going up and the lockers are pretty stable and the phone orderer are really really small anyway so that's very interesting to see that that first of all like if I use the same trend for all the accessories I would probably have an impact on a different categories with a different way especially the the the lights and uh the the bottle so my first intuition is maybe we should have a subcategory so let's have a look now at about electric bike for example and when you see Electric back you see oh it looks like we have the same behavior so let's add the trend line add the trend line maybe we can add the latest period to see if this change a lot okay so we can see that on the electric bike Market the the city bike is growing very fast but the mountain bike for the last three years is not growing that much so there will be also an a strong impact if I use the same Trend so I will probably use also the sub category for electric bike as well so it looks like we're going to do it for everything mountain bike let's give a try Mountain bik are quite very similar so I could use two different or I could use the the combination of these two I will have almost the same results let's have a look on not this one category kids B electric bike let's have a look now on closing so closing the problem is you also have seasonality so you have the winter where we where we can see remove that you have the winter collection like this you have the winter collection with a big peek and you have the summer collection as well so in this case we are talking also about seasonality not only TR but I can see that if we if you look at the trend of this the winter one are very similar and the summer one the problem is I have another out layer but they're quite similar as well but I will I will definitely see that the summer one are growing and the winter one are declining so I could combine these two or I could do two separate at the end my conclusion of this analysis is you should do the same with your own category and you should see if you have like at your sub level if you have maybe category and subcategory you can call that also family of product if you have big difference for that and my answer for this specific compan is yes so I should not use the trend at the category level but at the subcategory level unless maybe you have 10,000 sub category and it's way too complex for you so don't look for Perfection but just do graphic analysis and if it's too complex at the beginning just use one trend for one big category and one you have more information or more maturity you can go deeper and that's what we're going to do in the next episode we're going to start doing Trend calculation per subcategory
okay so what we could do in the previous episode is that we have different Trend per category but also by subcategory and know the next question is how do we calculate the trend by subcategory not only for one but for all of them so what we're going to do now we're going to copy and paste this tab and we're going to start calculating like up and we're going to start calculating the trend by subcategory so we're going to go back to design no pivot analysis the field list I recommend to do it with me as well don't either like this we're going to move this and subcategory perfect we're going to remove the filter for specific categories now we we do have all of this we're going to keep only the last three years why because then before that we had the p and uh it looks like it's more relevant to keep on it the last three years in this specific case but you should give a give a try with your own data set and see what how it looks like then what we're going to do we're going to change the format we're going to go to design report layout tabular form and we're going to repeat all item label label what I'm going to do after I'm going to do to more sort options and do descending by sum of cells then I have my biggest my biggest subcategory before and now we're good to go so we have all of this which is great and what I'm going to do next so we have all this tab t I'm going to remove this like this and save okay now what I'm going to do we're going to copy and paste so why are you going to copy and paste because you don't want to do this process of calculating your Trend every single uh week you want to do it only on a regular oops what happened I'm going to copy this here just leave some space if you refresh and you have a new data set coming so I'm I'm going to do like this tack this is the same value why I'm doing this because if you connect your calculation to this tab every week you're going to use this you're going to refresh and it's going to basically change all your calculation and you don't need to recalculate the trend by subcategory every single week or every single month I'm going to tell you when to do it I recommend per quarter or twice a year but this is not a very U like you don't have to do it every week basically so now you have this information and we're going to just do like this equal category I'm going like this it's more run toal and do like this CL and also like this nice I don't need to have this ground total so I'm going to remove this ground total from here thata here that run total of for colon so now I don't have the total here so I can remove it also something very important I did the mistake this month is not full so you can see the total we are around four 5 Millions per month and this one is only 2 two two millions why because this one is not full this is not the complete month of August so what you should do you should remove if your month is not complete very important I just add you a reminder on this type because we are redoing the the same type here make sure you only copy remove current mods not complete very important okay so we have this tab only with this all this information we have we can use the paint to copy the same format clack nice to let you know just I like to have to make it blue on the other side it's blue because I just did like this and this is the same we can do the same if you like it or not okay so now I have this tab and now I want to calculate the trend by subcategory what is missing now is my period so we're going to do one two you need the number of period like we did in the other file and you can even extend because we're going to do future period as well okay perfect now we have this and we can just apply the formula that we know to calculate the trend so you have two formulas you have the trend formula equal trend and you have the forecast linear which is exactly the same okay so we're going to use TR this time just for fun TR n uh X the y s is so what are the Y is the value so we're going to select this then I go back to my selection oops sorry I'm moving a lot then the x is the period the n one great and then the new X the new X is this one because we we focus for this one specifically and then okay so now we have this value great I'm proud of you we're going to lock the formulas for with F4 F4 F4 F4 and we're going to lock also the row of this one F4 just the the row 53 nice so now we have this can put values like this and we're going to do like this T and T have one missing something doesn't work no I should not log this I shouldn't be able to move down as well so I need to lock just the Colum perfect so now I do like this okay and I do like this clack it looks good now it looks very good I'm do it like this going to extend a bit size nice so now I do have all my Trends let's give a try to see how it looks I'm going to do like this insert so my mountain bike is going down what's happening I do like this and what what you can do as well select data and you're going to add the revenue and you can select the same one okay okay so now you have the revenue I'm going to double click to make it like this so now you can see the revenue of mountain bike declining and if you want to check other one you can check for example this one you do like this for woman or let's do electricity bike and don't forget also to change this one like this T tck this one is going up so congratulation we now have the trend per subcategory automatically from the revenue of this company and in the next episode I'm going to tell you what we're going to do with that to connect with your forast
okay so now in this episode what are we going to do with this trend that's a very good question because yes we have this number but at the end I are we going to connect that to the the real world so I I really invite you to go back to the trend tab this is the exact same work I did but I just did it in a goodlook way it's blue we have all the sub category we have the trend forecast I just copy and paste the value and then I did the trend forecast okay so we have all the trend forecast not only in the past but also in the future so just if you want to do it in the future it's very simple you just have to extend this formula like this to have it in the future make sure you have a period at the top and that will extend your Trend not only in the in the present but also in the in the past but also in the future okay so if I do that I just reselect the information M back Revenue edit going to go to BC we going to go up to ca ca dollar r and same here no like this so now you see you have the trend not only for the the past but also for the future it's just the continuation of this uh graph of this uh very straight line into the trend of this specific category so now we have the future Focus as well and what are we going to do with that right that's a very good question that's a very good question so now you can see on my tab I have all this percentage and I think this is a I think my personal idea I never saw that before and this is maybe my invention Maybe not maybe you're doing the same maybe I should have a Nobel Prize for forecasting for that maybe you think it's a it's I'm over I'm overselling myself but I really like the idea so what are we going how are we going to analyze this we're going to use what we call like percentage of variation or we're going to convert Trend into percentage how how how do you do that first we're going to do the past sales and then the trend let's give a try for example with kids we let's let's have a look on the kids for example kids four to 6 years old you have this minus minus 6us 12 months what is that I basically did first the analysis only on the past sales so if you look at the formula I'm comparing this is my past sales of the last 12 months of my data dat set versus the 12 months before so it's average and average minus one very simple okay so just tells me that okay on this specific category minus 6% my kids category 4 to six years old was declining about 6% in the past I did the same for six months and for three months just to have an idea so six months in the past versus the months before this one is not necessarily relevant because you let's give a let's have a look on the graph will be more relevant just change the trend to this one okay so you can see that the the trend is going down but if you look at the sales you have minus 2% for the six man and in the past minus 3% you have you are going by plus 41% why because you can see that you going up on the last three months so I will not say that this one is necessarily relevant especially if you have a big seasonality but it's just good to have an overview uh of what what were the past sales growth now I do the same with the trend so how do you do I do exactly the same principle but with the trend you can see the minus 8% the minus 8% basically I'm taking the next 12 months of my Trend here versus the last 12 months of my Trend so only on this specific line okay so it's going down so I can see that these 12 months are going minus 8% versus this one on the shart so let's look the formula you can see like you have the past and you have the future I compare the next 12 months versus the last 12 months and this number is very very interesting because you can see that overall my category if I look at my current trend is going is De Planning by 8% if I do 6 months it's 4% if I do 3 months it's 2% I really like the 12 months because you don't have any seasonality impact if you multiply by the average but it's also good to see what is the trend of this one as well so if I check the three months for example I'm just comparing the next 12 month three months of my Trend versus the last 12 months okay so now I have a percentage which is very interesting I have the percentage I'm going to do it for all my categories I just copy and paste the same formula like this what is interesting as well is to see the global level you can see that our BMX is going really bad minus 57% but the global is growing by 2% it's growing by 2% I have this one doesn't work why let's give a try I think I didn't copy the formula for this one t Okay so 0% for the past and in the future you have plus 2% and plus 1% in the next episode I'm going to tell you how to analyze this number and how to optimize the period of your Trend selection because based on the period you're going to select you're going to have different percentage of grow or declining
okay so now in this episode we're going to optimize the period of the trend selection what I am talking about you can see on my graph I have some like yellow colors and what are these yellow colors these yellow colors means that I'm selecting a different period for my Trend selection for the kids I'm starting from this so if you look at my formula I'm starting from the beginning and I select the last two years and a half of trend but for the mountain bike you you can see that I'm not selecting the same period I'm I'm starting from I'm removing basically one year of uh sales history in my Trend selection why that's a very good question I'm going to show you the graph of my mountain bik and the trend of my mountain bike so this is the trend but I'm not using the last year why because I'm going to now I'm going to add this into the graph you can see that my trend if I use the full period like 24 no 20 like this you can see that the normal trend of this last two years and a half trend is going down I'm going to change the color but I don't want to use this one why because it looks like in 20121 we had bigels maybe was due at the after pandemic but if I remove this here my trend is going up so that's that's a decision you have to take if I was because if I take the the selection only of this period my trend is going by plus 11% if I take this 2001 into consideration my trend is going down so I'm going to go back to the previous formula to show you the difference I'm going to change my formula again up and I'm going to reselect the entire period T and T like this going to do that we're going to copy and paste the formula click and now you can see that we have up sometime you have to unzoom to see okay you have the exact same Trend and it's going down and the problem is like I was plus 11% now I'm minus 6% so this is a decision you have to take for yourself and this is your own analysis is like which period do you want to take to calculate your Trend one year 2 years 3 years 5 years and this selection will influence a lot the trend selection you want to do and in this specific case they say you know what yeah we have this specific air is 2021 but it looks like now the trends start to stabilize and even grow so I don't want to take into consideration this specific period you can do this analys not only in one minute but in few or even multiple hours you can can also talk with sales Finance marketing to also understand the trend of the category but the the period of the selection is very very important that's why you cannot do it product by product but you can do it by category or subcategory in my specific case I prefer to say you know what I'm going to remove this period because is not relevant for me I prefer to only look at the trend for the last two years and I'm going to change the formula and in this specific one I'm going to move my my selection from 21 to 22 okay like this I'm going to do like this and I'm going to paste my formula and now up sometime you have to zoom in and zoom I'm taking a positive trend and that's my decision for this one so I recommend to have a graph analysis first to look at the numbers especially the plus 12 months and if you think that one is going a bit weird or too strong you should change the selection and see if maybe you have to remove one or two years history or maybe you have to include more history in your in your Trend selection to make it great at the end this is not your final call we're going to keep optimizing uh you can see like for different per different subcategory I select different period And I had to I like to add a color to make make it clear okay this is the P I'm selecting for this specific category so you can do your own idalis maybe have a look on different categories maybe you want to change my own selection because you think it's more relevant but it's also by connecting with the business that you will really understand what's going on and you can also add comments to explain your own decision
okay so now let's talk about outliers cleaning we've done outliers cleaning for the average sales per product but let's do it also per category and subcategory uh let's give a let's have a look on the the kids 6 to 9 years old okay so I'm going to change my selection do like this and my Trend like this okay so now you can see we have we have this selection but there is a common say exceptional cells so let's have a look on the data set on the right and you can see oh what happened here School cells six now you can change my comment 600k correction ha so it looks like we had an exceptional sales about 600k and when I look at my numbers at the top my initial number was not 200 it was 8 800 so this is my initial value and I did a manual correction why because it looks like we're in an exceptional cell so if I go back to my graph and I put this CL let's look at my Trend my trend is going crazy my my trend is now going plus 23% but it was one specific sell on one specific product and sometimes you have to remove these s lers because this is not the reality and if you don't correct the p P the future will be incorrect for your forecasting process so you you need to identify as well how do you identify First you look at this number and you see if they look weird or not we're going to talk about the Sal Target after but if you have a big difference between your specific Target and the current Trend maybe there is something wrong that you have to clean and the best way to clean always for me is with the shots okay you can also use Gap analysis with percentage but I really like to see the shot and you have a problem here and here so what what would did was simply to correct our sales history by removing 600k on this specific forecast don't forget to add a comment to make sure that this is visible and that's why also I feel it's very important to copy and paste the value from your pivot table because if you don't copy and paste value each time you're going to refresh this tab you're going to lose the correction of your tab okay so this is a very important process you correct you have a look you do it because you don't have many subcategories so you can you can check the graph of every single subcategory and then you can adjust we could also address if we want this specific dat Ty Point looks very weird I would move it maybe to $130,000 so let's do the same T tac tac and let's move this value to 130 okay let's change the T maybe put put it black and add a comment correction I forgot 300K or something T nice and now if I go back to my shot it's it's even better and now you can see that my category which was going plus 25% now it's going down by minus 4% so it's very important to do this cleaning process as well you can do it manually you don't have to do this every week but this is very I think relevant if you want to have the correct TR without any crazy uh outliers
okay my friends so now let's talk about the sales Target you can see there is a box sales Target what we're going to do with that the question now you need to select the right Trend selection for your subcategory okay what is the final number that you want to use in your formula to apply to every products of your subcategory that's a very good question so if I go back to my Trends you can see sales Target this is a vup from my target Tab and my target tab is this one and you can see that I don't know if you remember but we did our financial Target by subcategory and for example for mon B we had minus 10 no plus 10% for woman minus 5 electricity by 20% and BMX minus 35% I like also this one phone holder plus 100% so this is the moment and this is like I really like this process and I wish had this process before in my uh manager or director life because it's easy to explain as well and it's very important that you listen to me this is your mathematical Trend okay for example mountain bike if I look at the last 12 months now the trend projection on the next 12 months based on the my S history we are growing by 11% so let's say you have a meeting and you have a meeting and you're going to talk to the mountain bike man Chief Department say look your your target this year is plus 10% or statistical Trend say that we are growing by 11% at the category level we are very close so I don't see any problem okay so when you are close it's a very good sign it means like your initial Target is very close it could be sales Target Finance Target but this is a very good sign now you can talk about percentage if you talk about Trends with like ax plus b or slope or intercept this is a mathematical language or Alpha Gamma or whatever this is very difficult to connect with the the reality of the other department in your business but when I see these two numbers they say okay now we can have a chat let's see another one electric bike or no this one mon bike woman they're very similar as well so now you need to decide okay what is my Trend selection do I want to choose my sales Target or my my 12 months Target I'm going to say you know what I'm going to do I'm going to do up I'm going to change my keyboard I'm going to take my 12 because this is very similar same for this one for electricity byy we are very close as well but now let's take one which is very different for example the road bike man my trend is plus 14% but my sales Target is zero and my my selection is 0% why because sometimes you have information in the you don't have the information in the past that are going to happen in the future maybe they plan to uh have less exposure of the road bike category they're going to do maybe less marketing they're going to lose customer and having this information you could say like less marketing exposure for example and you say you know what we know that your category is growing by 14% but we're going to keep the commercial Target for this one because we don't want to Overstock and we know that we have less we're going to have less exposure in the past so this is a really discussion you could also say you know what I'm going to split the the the hle pine two we're going to use 5% it could be also a manual decision uh this one for example say okay the keys are declining but we don't want to uh we still want to protect this family so we're going to go to 0% we are not going to apply the minus 8% uh this one as well uh okay we had a big sale we did a big correction but we want to go to um something close to the minus we're going to use the six month average for this one so at the end this is a consensus that you should have between yourself your data and the other department to say do you want to sponsor or push specific families or you want to use just the statistical Trend if you don't have anything if you don't have any information you can I recommend to use the 12 month Trend this is the more relevant one but sometimes you really want to amplify one category because this is your new top strategy for your company for example the phone holder the gross is only by 5% but they have strong ambition so okay we're going to use 100% so we're going to for course all the forecast we're going to see that later in the shart uh maybe I can show you on the global dashboard chart if I select oops the phone holder boom you can see that this is the gross in this is the compilation of all the forecasts of the funold category this is you can see the last year and this year they very similar and boom you can see that now we're targeting plus 100% grow in the overall Cate but it's going to be applied in all the products so the risk is to create Overstock for example but it's also a very powerful tool if you really want to sponsor a full category and you don't want to do it man manually one by one so that was my um my trick for you if you want to align the statistics and the business sometimes you need to find cons sometimes you're going to push only the statistics sometimes you're going to use the commercial Target sometimes you're going to go you're going to go in between or you're going to be a bit more like cautious for example BMX we're going to the minor 57 maybe is too strong so we're going to keep into minus 35 process so that's it for this video I'm going to see you for the next one to include this trans selection into your forecast
okay my friends so now what we going to do with this number that's a very good question so now we're going to go back to the base you remember we had these two we had the flat one and the gross one and what I'm going to do now I'm going to close this so we have the average demand okay and we're going to apply a trend so what is this trend this trend is 20 3% so it's just a v cup of my subcategory electric city bike and my tab and I just did a v up between this tab this original category to my Trend selection okay so this is something very simple no V up also something very important you may have maybe a completely a very small category with no Trend at all you could also add new category and say you know what new category whatever and you could say you know what we're going to use the one because this is the global Trend plus 2% you category Cate Cate and we're going to say we're going to use the same one than the global one and my selection will be the same okay you you you could do like this up so if you don't have any like you have a new category with no Trend you could um you could just Define a number as well and it's going to be appli in your V Cup in this specific tab so you have the 23% of your electric city bike Electric City Bike plus 23% this is my selection here okay great now I just said another option maybe on one or two specific produ you you say you know what I know that the category I want to push the category by 23% but this specific prod is going like crazy and I want to do it even stronger so I'm going to do plus 50% so if you do like this you're going to change the the the the quantity like the 50% will erase the 23% so my formula is simple you just say if basically my cell is not empty I'm going to use this value if this is empty I'm going to use the 23% and at the end we're going to use this 50% to apply to my forecast formula okay so we're going to talk about more like when do we have to change Etc also have a conditional formatting here to alert you because you don't want to have too many manual values and if you look like AC edit rules if this is not blank then this is red if my file is too slow for you is to calculate you can remove this conditional formatting this is not mandatory but it's good to have an alert because you don't want to have you want to have more of them automatic not with manual value okay so now we have this 50% of trend and what we're going to do in my forast before we at 56 and we're going to do times 1 plus my Trend 50% nice so now you can see that my value moved moved this one I'm going to do like this past value boom so you can see that I still have a flat I still have a flat shot like a flat um row but before it was at I forgot the number like 50 and now he moved to 84 so I raised all the the average sales of all these products this is not in this shape because this sh is much more difficult to apply but this is much easier to understand and you know what if this PL is selling more in the future because you can see that the Sals are clearly 79 are not as strong except for the last months the average sales will also raise and naturally the the the forecast will also increase step by step so this is a better way to include the trend into the forecast easy to understand connect it to the business and I hope you like this way this is not this is not an automatic trend line because this one is very difficult to apply at the item level and I really like this one what we're going to do next we're going to we're going to include the seasonality and then you going to understand how to combine all these parameters to make a more accurate forecast
okay so before we talk about seasonality I just wanted to go back to the trend review process you don't have to review all these Trends every single week or every single day that's why I told you you refresh this tab then you copy and paste the value then nothing will change every time you're going to update this file then you're going to do all your analysis and I recommend to do it the best I think for me will be every quarter every month I think will be too much unless you have massive change in your in your sales or demand but I will do it every quarter and if it's too much I will do it every every six months the financial I don't know if you remember with the CFO we are doing a financial big financial review every uh six months to make sure that we're on track with the sales targets but if you have the time and the energy you can do it every month otherwise quarter or every six months to readjust this trend selection okay so don't don't over in this process we're going to do the same after with seasonality you don't have to review the seasonal all the time you have a clear direction for this year and then you just do maybe one or two adjustment if you have a specific very strong cells but this is fixed in your Excel file so you don't have any any big change if you're also using an Erp system or forecasting system you could also use these parameters and upload these parameters into your system and say you know what in this specific category we're going to we're going to increase the average sales by x% okay so I hope you like this uh this way of working this is one one of the way I recommend because this is easy to explain you can also use the mathematical Trend if you if you think this is more accurate at the end you should track the accuracy and select the most efficient one and S the simplest one for your team
in this chapter we're going to talk about seasonality forecasting this is one of the pillars of the forecast for the Baseline but first of all we talked about it before but I wanted to go deeper why do we need a seasonality and the seasonality for me is to allocate the right resources at the right time especially the right time why what kind of resource are we talking about it could be about money it could be inventory could be like the staff your team members if you have a warehouse I was a warehouse logistic director for many uh for hundred of people and I had to locate the right people at the right time before Christmas for the peak and I could not do it the last just the last minute so I had to find I had to find an accurate forecast to know okay one was the best time to recruit people to uh to pick all the products for the customer you could also do it for your energy but also for the energy you consume uh for the time and also for the communication if you have a Christmas Peck you have to make sure like you cannot just say we're going to sell 1 million product next year you need to know when which intensity to also allocate the right resources like marketing promotions and advertisement in the same time so you need to align all of this let's say you have these sales uh for one year you can see we have a strong seasonality if you don't apply your seasonality if you use the same average um forecast you're going to have for example just for the the inventory Overstock before you're going to miss the peak and then you're going to have Overstock again this is a classic m take for inventory management and the idea is really to follow this cycle as close as possible from the seasonality cycle to make it possible we do have multiple seasonality this is for example the 10th seasonality I know this U produ very well I was responsible for the forecasting at DEC Catlin it's a very big spus company and you can see we have this is the volume of research from Google we're going to use this tool later to improve your seasonality but this is interesting to see like when people are looking for products on internet usually they that's the moment they're going to buy it and in the US you have a strong seasonality for Springtime for tent and much less for summer um so what kind of seasonal factors do we have we have the weather it could be also the the season during the year from winter to summer o days period if you have o days for kids you may have like a massive Peak for specific products for kids events such as World Cup we're going to get back to this one cultur like the Valentine Sun Valentine Valentine Days economic if you have any recession that're not necessarily very predictable or for the planning the planning for example your factory is CL closing every Satur Sunday or Saturday you need to plan that it's it's kind of a seasonal Factor as well every Saturday or every Sunday my factor is closed or every Saturday I have a strong peak of demand in my retail store so this is also part of the seasonality if you go back for example to the soccer B seasonality and I know this products very well as well I was working on the this the forecast of these products millions of balls per year with the catlon and we could see that we had a massive Peck during the World Cup people were buying much more soccer ball during the World Cup like people are being much more tennis ball when there is ronga Ros or Wimbledon for example and or US Open where is the last one Australian Open of course at the end it's very interesting because we had a massive peak of sales every four years and this one was pretty good for mbappe and then you see the seity didn't repeat at the same time because the World Cup in Qatar was not four years after it was 5 years and a half after or something like that so it was because of the pandemic and because of um uh because of the winter and summer season in Qatar so what I was doing when I was working with the forecast of soer ball we had to erase basically if you were in this in this period we had to erase the the Peak from last year for the average sales and we had to apply when it was in the future let's say if you were just before we had we had to go back to the the sales history four years before to see what was the behavior and to apply the same seasonality uh in advance to make sure we will follow the same peak of seasonality from the soccer ball for the World Cup we have another one for this is the Amazon Revenue per quarter and you can see that every quarter four we do have a big Peck uh due to the the Christmas sales and Black Friday which are very important for these company so you can have quarter sales you can have monthly sales week weekly sale weekly seasonality daily seasonality hour seasonality for warehouse pecking for example even minutes for energy Supply or less than one second if you are if you are speculating or doing trading on the stock market and we're going to go back to the the bike seity we have a we have a good seity for the bike industry especially for this kind of products and if I use for example the energy consumption cycle this is the energy consumption per year in the in the US and you have a big pick um you have a big Peck in Winter and you can see that per I'm not sure it was in the US and this is per day you can also see that you have a very consistent seasonality people wake up they have their coffee cant and baguett and the fridge and Etc and um and the coffee machine the shower and everything so they use energy for that and then the massive peek is when they go back to from work and you can see we almost have the same peek every day during the week but I'm sure during the weekend it's a bit different as well so we have monthly and we have all in this specific case so that was just a quick introduction to to show you that we were talking about the how many with the level of sales how many quantities per week or per month then we talk about the Trend or the gross we transform the trend into gross uh to see if you are if we're growing or not in this specific subcategory and now we're going to spread the forecast to make it like this to have this kind of forecast you know like in the same time using level Trend but also having the when when the are we going to to to sell or the products or consume the product and that's what we're going to do now into Excel
all right so now let's go back to the Excel file we do have this Excel file you may maybe you don't have exact the all these formulas before because I didn't save the file each time then you don't have to reconnect with all the the connection that's why but just to keep in mind what we did before we did the average sales so we did the average sales we took 12 months for example then we had the we had the avability correction and at the end we had all this we had this formula to say okay average demand okay so this is 56 I do have 56 this is the 12 months there is no correction and no avability correction and for this we apply a trend plus 23% because my category electric electricity bike is growing by is growing pretty good is growing by electricity Bike by 23% and this is my Trend selection I explained this in the previous chapter great so now if you have a look on the right I do have my forecast with my average Dem plus my Trend okay multiply by my Trend and I do have 69 and just to compare that that was the linear Trend I was just comparing with the forecast linear Trend and you see at the end we almost have the same but this one is a the average PR grow is stable and the one is growing in a linear way but it's much more difficult uh to implement and it was not necessary more accurate we're going to see that later and we we could see that when we're checking the different models so at the end now what I want I want to include the seasonality right I want to include the seasonality and let's see for example in the past do we see any seasonality so let's go back to the skew dashboard and let's see do you see any seasonality it's not easy to see like this so what you can do on the right I also included T this is the sales per period and you can see okay can you see any seasonality H I'm not sure about it not sure about it's not easy to write that to to read this graph so let's do another one but this time I'm going to you can just copy and paste this one fill this I'm going to my remove my date and put my months to see if there is any pattern per month and then I'm just doing the sum of this because it's not easy to read like this when you have especially per per item because you don't have you don't have enough volume to see any Trend and this one is a big value so then we're going to insert a graph so this is the sum of all my years for this specific bik and you can see yeah it looks like we have a trend during uh June and July interesting let's let's get another one the kids bike let's have a look the more you have set his story the better you will be able to see that this one is a bit weird like June and July that's the problem when when you when you check by by product you may have very inconsistent seasonality and that's why you you we're going to go into a category after because this is not very consistent also if I take one with a lot of shortages like take for example this one tac tac tac you can see like just at this level this one is very messy so it's not it's not easy also because you also have we did some correction with the the old layers as you can see like for example this one was corrected but at the end we also have a lot of out of stock how do you correct this out of stock to eify seasonality this is even more complex you can see that my my average looks pretty pretty consistent I like this forecast very stable but maybe I could also apply a seasonality to this forecast right so let's give a let's have a look how it looks it's a bit uh bit messy but there is a peak here okay so there is a Peak in May then in August but it's crashing in July which doesn't make a lot of sense maybe because it was probably because it was out of stock as well so it's it's not easy let's let's take a very slow move now for example I don't know this light randomly yeah okay now there is a Peck in August and not in June or May or July so this is not easy to uh to be honest I could do this and the lower at the volume the less accurate will be your seasonality the conclusion of this first video is what is I do not recommend to take the seasonality per product directly and I see many companies and software forecasting software using the seasonality per product and for me I've been working with millions of products and the things you always have when you do a training you always have the good example with a big volume for example you're going to have yeah of course when I do the the company forecasting it makes sense to use the seasonality of the company right because it's very stable you have a lot of volume and at the end you see your your seasonality will be very very smooth but when you do a product that is selling 10 products a year or even less it doesn't make a lot of sense and you're going to start having very weird numbers that will completely mess up your forecast so at the end my conclusion if I go back to the conclusion of that is like I did for the trend we're going to explore and say you know what we're going to keep the level at the item level which makes a lot of sense you're going to save for example 100 per month for the trend we we we use the subcategory growth and now we're going to do the same with seasonality we're going to see if if it's better to use the seasonality for the overall company for the category or for the subcategory and that's what we're going to do in the next episode
okay so now let's do the seasonality analysis per category and then we're going to do it by subcategory to Define what is the best level of granularity to calculate my forecast so it's going to be very similar to the trend analysis we already know that we have some big change but let's do it again and then we're going to go back to my file with seasonality and I'm going to explain to you how it work okay so let's go let's insert a new let's insert a new pivot table from table no from external data source if you are using powerquery if you don't use powerquery new worksheet you can do it in the classic way old school way okay and now what I'm going to do I'm going to do the category and the sales all that's the first question you are you doing the seasonality in value or quantity that's a very question let's have a look maybe they are very different maybe not select data I'm not sure it's going to work no it doesn't work like this up what I have to [Music] do so what's happening here okay so now we do have the global I'm going to I'm going to remove the category up I'm going to do like this I'm going to take the Ms and I'm going to switch this one to select combo second axis line line so we can see at the global level for the company there is not a massive change between quantity and sales I would say that maybe there is a change here because of Christmas for specific products maybe kids bike so in this specific company at the global level there is no big change but I always recommend to use value if possible because if you have big change regarding the price in your in your category because we're going to do it by category subcategory for example you have a very cheap product with like massive order and the the rest is like very expensive but not with the same quantity you're going to affect your seasonality if you work in manufacturing I see a lot of seasonality made with quantity but make sure you don't have too much too much price difference okay so I always do in value if I when I can do in value give a try and compare the two seasonality pattern and if you feel there is one that is better than the other one you just keep the right one for you okay so now we do have the seasonality for the company you can see that you have this Peak from April to July and August always goodlooking chart and now let's see if we can go deeper we already done that in the Target mode in the Target we done that with the financial forecast this is the seasonality that we did before but let's go deeper now let's go What's Happening by category category black so by category it looks like we almost have the same seasonality so we have a big one with mountain bike this is all the year maybe I should remove I don't know if you remember I should remove the year with the pandemic let's have a look if we change if we remove 20 2020 we have we have a very different shape so it's also interesting to remove that this is the sum of all this year except 2020 we're going to go back to aut to clean your seasonal process but at the end yes we have these but they're not at the same scale so this one looks like they have approximately the same not exactly the same but more or less now let's remove the big three this one this one and this one then you can see that the keys bike for example there is a there is a weird pick in July we're going to see that later we could see that in the trend we had massive orders maybe that this is the reason maybe not so Keys is a bit different and accessories okay and you can see that for example the closing one is very has a very different shape and BMX is is just small so it it doesn't look like we're going to work by category because we don't have the same shape and seasonality by category U no I don't want to work sorry by C category total like I I would not use the CATE the full seasonality of my company this one were working before because by category we we have different patterns so now what we're going to do in the next video we're going to analyze if there is not subcategory that behave differently inside the same category and like we did for the trend and if this is the case we will have to do seasonality by sub subcategory and not category so maybe you get confused but at the end you go macro then you go to the layer um below and then below and at one point you see why you have to stop if it's too complex or maybe too many categories or you don't have enough data and then you stop and you can start implementing your seasonality for your forecast
okay so now let's do the seasonality by subcategory so what we're going to do we're going to copy this copy like this up nice and now I'm going to include go to pivot table field list and I'm going to include the subcategory insert graph nice per mon okay so now we go to design okay so I don't see I can't see basically it's not easy to see that so what we're going to do we're going to do like Trend before we're going to select and see okay maybe you can see road bike first looks like for road bike per month we have kind of the same seasonality not the same pattern in July this one is June to July is growing a bit this one is declining a bit keeping mind we don't have years 2020 if I include 2020 my pattern will be a bit different all right so we go back to this but this one not a big change let's go to m bike similar it's going deeper for men wait you don't see men is decelerating faster and going higher so this is not the same value at the end if you want really to compare you need to go select data no not select data maybe I can do it like this you go here and you select secondary axis then we have the same a so we have not the same value but it's the same axis and then we're going to convert into B basis 100% then you can really compare but you look like they're pretty similar as well right so I'm not very concerned for these two I could use all to separate or the I could combine these two that would be almost the same let's check no electric bike electric bike it's a bit different you can see that the mountain bike is going a bit longer into the season when Electric City bike is stting slowly and then it's going deeper like this so not exactly the same pattern but still we have a big peak between May June and July and up to August now let's take what do we want to take kids bike so kids bike like we have a problem with this family kids back 6 to 9 years old and the rest looks like they have the same behavior no let's let's remove the 600 six and N yeah we have the same behavior but the it looks like the 9 to 12 is going deeper to Christmas than the 4 to6 more more GI for the the older kids apparently and now let's take a very interesting one the closing one so the closing one is very different well we could see with the trend before Trend analysis we could see that like if this is the last three years last two years and a half you can see that we have a massive Peak for winter products and you have a a very different Peak for summer products okay so clearly just by looking at the closing one between men colle woman summer and the winter you can see that the winter ones and the summer one are completely different so if you apply the same seasonality for winter product and the summer products or even the global sity of the company you will have a big problem of accuracy for the the one in the in December in Winter because they have a complete completely different seasonality from the rest of the company so the conclusion of this analysis is yes you should go to the sub category at least for this kind of category because otherwise you're going to miss a lot of opportunity there basically seeing almost zero in May June and July and a lot in November December so you really need to take this into consideration you don't necessarily need to U separate these two you could combine these two and that's why we're going to do later but definitely you need to do that okay so I think that was a good um good analysis I'm very proud of you and me we have to Auto congratulate ourself as often as possible this is part of the positive mindset set in this world of stress and email and blah blah blah and at the end this is the accessories one so accessories you have very very small one very close to zero the phone holder it looks like we still have a peck especially for elmet and um and what is that and water bottle and if we remove these two water bottle water and helmet helmet helmet when we do that we we like the Lo the lockers are following the bicycle cality and the lights are a bit weird very flat if I had the trend on this one it's very very very flat I feel okay so at the end the conclusion of that I'm going to repeat myself again we do have different seasonality per subcategory so the conclusion of that is you should do the seasonality at the subcategory level for this specific company not at the item level because this is too small we don't have enough information now you have to question yourself the most important in this analysis first is to have the right information between your category and subcategory to have the right product in the right category this is a big work to do and you have to collaborate with the product manager the maybe the sales the sales team it's also good to have the same category between sales marketing and products uh but when you you've done this work or you can see some pattern and this is great maybe you don't even see any seasonality and this is this is okay I'm going to tell you what to do and in the next episode we're going to start calculating the seasonality and how to integrate this into your forecast
okay so we did seasonality analysis and we could see that it's better to do a seasonality per subcategory I just wanted to show you again this very specific Excel formula that you can use to detect automatically if you have a seasonality pattern or not so let's go back to I think it was in Trends and in Trends maybe you can see that in the in the file on not but there is a there is a Formula called Focus ETS ETS seasonality I don't know if you remember when with did the forecast per product automatically with Excel let's select this period and value let's go to data forecast sheet and remember we had this graph where you could generate automatically the forecast and when you click into options you can see that you can detect automatically the seasonality and you can see there is a number 12 the number 12 was found automatically and we can use it's a formula that we can uh get automatically from Excel then you can detect oh if do we have a seasonality pattern this one basically every 12 period there is it looks like there is a cycle every 12 cycle okay so I'm not going to do that but we use this formula called forecast. ETS seasonality to to identify if you have any period cycle seasonality and how many cycle do you have every How many pairs the the cycle is repeating or not to do that don't forget you need to have 1 two three so above the period 1 2 3 you need to indicate How many pairs do you have and the number of of it so you do like this and then you do equal if you don't remember the formula just press forecast enter and pick the one called forecast. ETS do seasonality press okay then the values you select the values nope this one what is that times I don't like what is doing no that you select like this the timeline SP use numbers than the date the data completion just press one and just okay so by doing that you say oh you found 12 12 periods so that's the detection of seasonality and then you just do like this make sure you lock the first row F4 F4 and then you do like this so now you can see 12 12 this one is interesting only 11 so there is a cycle every 11 period we only have three years history so maybe that's the reason this one there is no there is no it looks like there is no seasonality based on Excel so let's let's have a look select data switch let's see the key back and the problem is because we have a weir number enter I think it's because of this we number because of this exceptional cell so it doesn't see any seasonal pattern let's do contrl Z contrl Z contrl Z back okay 11 12 12 and 11 then you can copy and paste and do it for the subcategory below that was for the trends and see what do you have and you can see that some of them there is a clear seasonality some of them there is half of them there is zero and that's that's a challenge because um sometimes you don't really see clearly the cality and to be honest Excel doesn't take much risk uh to identify that it's not also cleaning the seasonality with the wrong years with layers but this is just it's always interesting to see there is an obvious pattern is going to find it if not you will have to do the the the job by yourself just by curiosity you could also do it by product if you go to level at the item level you could also say you know what I'm going to try as well and do forecast seasonality and see if I find a seasonality pattern so the values I'm going to take take this the period it doesn't matter if you go like as this one we start with the the most recent period for for this formula it doesn't matter if it's going like descending or ascending okay no problem nice now you have to you have 11 for this item we have to look F4 and F4 23 11 4 we have a 12 finally 23 what's happening with 23 in set yeah now it will be too complex to check this one maybe I can uh check with my skew dashboard here nope I don't know why my doesn't display sometimes because I'm recording what's happening here okay okay so maybe there is a cycle every TR is repaired why not etc etc so you see we don't have we don't have a very clean you know consistent product that they sell always at the same time we do have a lot of 11 interesting more than 12 but the reality is like we have a lot of out of stock we have a lot of low sales and intermittent product so when you look and that's that's also good conclusion to not use season per product it's very difficult to identify and it's better to use the overall pattern of the subcategory to also send a direction to the whole subcategory to behave in a certain way than just to look one by one and at the end they're going to just do Weir numbers for most of them so I do not recommend to do that you can contrl Z to avoid the change I did in my file T Tac I'm going to remove contr Z okay then you're going to you are not messing up the rest of my formulas and in the next episode we're going to start calculating the seasonality per subcategory and prepare the data
okay so now in this episode we're going to prepare the data to calculate the seasonality so if you look at my file so I did some graph at the top here but at the end what is important is more what is below what is below you have PIV pivot table to get the data and then I copy and paste like the trend copy and paste value to avoid change after updating the file I copy first the global value then by subcategory and then I calculated the the basis 100 the the percentage of seasonality per category and subcategory not per category by sub category okay so this is very U interesting to do that and why I'm copying and P because I don't want to do this process every single week or every single month for me the seasonality work should be done once a year and you should be done once very in a good way and it should be reviewed once a year unless you have massive change in your seasonality during one specific year but you should plan this in advance especially at the beginning of the year okay so what we're going to do first we're going to prepare the data and then we're going to calculate how we're going to do that it's very simple I'm going to do another pyot table I'm going to do yeah I'm going to do it with you just to make sure it's clear so insert t so good to have power query right right my friend existing worksheet yes so I want to do my months and I want to do my sales in value I think I did the wrong way no yeah per year exactly okay so now I have perer I don't want to have the ground total so pivot analysis ground total of four row no okay so this is what I want okay so now I have my season seasonality oops not my city my Revenue globally great and what I'm going to do if we you check out my file I just copy and paste all of this make sure as well you don't forget to take the the fully ient the 2020 we're going to analyze this just after so when you copy and paste be careful don't copy and paste the full pivot table otherwise you're going to refresh and change all your calculation after every month or every week so don't take the first row and you go here you get some space because if you want to update this file every year it's good to have some space I need space than and you can see now you you cannot refresh this one this one is a pivot table this one is static good job so now we have this and you can already check the conditional formatting and see that we have different patterns right so that could what I did before why I'm displaying per because I want to analyze I want to go deeper than at the macro level I want to see maybe I should remove one maybe I should do some spec we're going to do specific calculation but when we're doing the micro level of the in the Target I was just summing all of them I was not displaying 2018 19 20 Etc I was just summing all of them and doing the full seasonality but in this specific case we're going to go deeper because you want to have something more accurate for your forecast okay so let's go back to this and now let's do the subcategory so I'm going to copy this one I'm going to paste here and this time we're going to display the category and the subcategory T okay great we're going to change the format to compact design report layout no not compact tab boom we're going to repeat all item label T tac tac and we don't need the ground total as well ground total of boom so now we have all of this now we need a total for the categories so we're going to do the subtotal for at the bottom of the group nice now we have the sub total and I'm going to fit also to have the biggest family first so more sort options ascending descending by sum of sales great so now we do have mountain bike and then we have the total of mountain bike can I remove this one I'm not sure I can remove this one sub total no I have to keep this one okay so now we have this good job and what you're going to do you're going to do the same you're going to copy and paste go down control shift down oops I'm lost it has to focus contrl C and you're going to copy as well so I'm going to wait I'm going to I think that's the right yes add some space as well why because when you're going to update this file next year you're going to you're going to have 2024 etc etc so just you don't want to break everything when when you're going to refresh you can even add another one and you can even make it very small then you have space CU if you refresh it's going to crash everything great so now we do have all this information for category and subcategory congratulation and now what we're going to do in the next episode we're going to start calculating the seasonality and see what are the different calculation we can apply to identify the the basis 100 season seasonality
okay so now let's calculate the seasonality and you can look at my file we do have first the global SE seasonality and then we're going to do it by subcategory how do we do that uh we're going to do first we're going to talk about the calculation uh we're going to copy this table like this because I'm lazy to write on this again and then we're going to talk about the formula so let's go back to sheet number two going to put it here no that was the wrong one nice and know you can see we have different formulas and we have the basis 100 and the basis 100 we're going to divide this divided by the total divided by 12 you could also change this by the average that will give you the same results we already we already done that before okay contrl + z now we're good to go so what we're going to do now we're going to we're going to do different ways what is the first way you can do you can do the average of this average very important it's better to do the average and the same especially if you don't have a complete full year if you don't have a complete full year and you do the same you're going to have like big numbers missing and it's going to be wrong so try to avoid try to avoid to beess complete years for like if you don't have a complete full year that will um that could impact the calculation of your seasonality so I will not do even for the average I would not do like this because maybe you have a massive gross for 2023 so I would just do complete yeah it's good to see the results but I will not use them then you do like this so now you already have something like very efficient but there is a but I don't like I don't like this 2020 year and I wanted to display that sometimes it's for the pandemic it's obvious but maybe for specific categories after it won't be obvious so it's good to see the details per year then you can adjust in a more efficient way okay so what we're going to do now we're going to remove 2020 so what you can do you do like this you do you select the first two and then you press control and do like this so you see no this two up I'm going to do it again control and control you can Al also do it manually if you prefer if it's too complex for you you do like this and then comma and then like this enter and then you do like this boom okay so now we do have a the same pattern you can see that the the basis stand is different so let's do contrl Z to see what was the difference so this is the basis 100 let's copy here check let's copy the value basis 100 all all year and now let's do again to just to compare what is the different in terms of value tag control okay great so now you can see we have for this one for example it's a massive change we have 11 points difference between all year and only four years so we're going to copy this like this no we're going to call it no 20 and then we're going to start improving this again so now we have this what we could do we could we could smooth I'm going to do a graph to see like this insert so this is the two we have right now they're pretty similar but I I prefer the orange one because we don't have this artificial Peck in the months of May it's more smooth but you can make it even smoother if you want so how do you do that that's another layer you can just do the average and what we're going to do I'm going to do first this month equal average and you're going to do the average not only of the current months but the previous months and the months after so you can do like this up and what you're going to do you're going to just duplicate this like this BM okay so that will be something even better but you know while I think I should remove also the year 2020 so what I'm going to do it's a bit more Advance I'm going to do average of this control this clack I do like this like this if I do like this doesn't work why because I'm taking the total of this so what I'm going to do I'm going to change this clck clck and then I'm going to go here comma control this and this so I'm going to do this for this one to the the last two months of the year and January and for this one I'm going to do the same we can do it from scratch all control control control control I'm just holding control all the time great so now let's compare what do we have in this graph select data add okay I know we have another one and you don't really see this one clearly let's change the color no of the shart of the curve and you can see that this one is even more we we smooth the seasonality of this of this of this seasonality of these values why because we took always the months before and the months after and this is we do it on the the last four years for five years so it's something very very smooth which can be very good when you don't want to have like massive change in your forecast it's even better if you do a weekly season seasonality this is all the same principle instead of having months we will have weak numbers I've done that if you follow my other course for example inventory management at the end this is the same but you will have more probability to have more change during within the week than within the months because you have less volume in a week than in a month so I I really recommend to do that especially if you have a weekly seasonal forecast to make sure you don't have too much variation if you have a massive Peck up and down is going to be quite messy and that's what we're going to use especially for the I think for the kids or very small volume the the smaller the volume the more important I feel it's important to smooth this calculation to make it as soft as possible so now that we have all um we have all these different calculation you should try and see which one is more relevant and the then I don't have massive change because this is a big this is we're talking about 40 50 millions of dollars per year but if you are selling only a few products uh you you have to make sure that you have something which is as clean as possible
okay now let's calculate the season by category I'm going to go back to I'm going to copy one like this and I'm going to do like this boom and you see because I have the right formula [Music] taada I do have my total and we're smoothing my sity maybe this is not necessary to smooth my seasonality for this one so I'm going to just do the average of this one and this one like this I'm going to do like this and like this I can also do the same conditional formatting then I can see okay I really don't want 2020 you can do it for all of them I think because you only do this once a year especially the first time you do it I will really take the time I'm doing it in like one or less than two hours but you should definitely spend maybe one one one or two days if you have a lot of products to make sure that you do it right the first time maybe keep it simple uh but this is important to to take some time on these parameter because then you're going to keep it for the next 12 months okay so I've done that make sure when you copy and paste you always divide by the this specific number of the same category don't divide by another one and we're going to just do like this and duplicate like this boom be careful of this one there is a second row so like this like this easy two voila voila I continue I continue back well if you have one category it will take more time maybe you should keep at the if you have too many categories keep it simple and go to the biggest category above okay that's a recommendation okay so now we have this and with this we already have a very good start you know we already have seasonality by subcategory uh this is um I think this is a great start and now you can decide if you want to optimize your seasonality by C you you have to analyze all these numbers to see if there is one for example we're talking about the kids one for example this one looks a bit weird when you have a number in the between and then you have this variation so what we're going to do during the next episode we're going to optimize this uh seasonal numbers by subcategory and see what we can do to improve that
so now how do we integrate this seasonality factor into your forecast that's a very good question and now if you go back to the base let's have a look okay so we I have my forecast the challenge of my forecast I need to connect the months of my forecast so you have M plus 0 it's the month of August I have the September October November I need to connect this with my category the new category that we selected based on the selection of this table so we already have this table and I need to connect that so for that I need also to know what is the mon number because M plus Z is not a monst number so we're going to open this and you can see there is oh there is8 9 10 so eight this is the same MTD we redo the forecast of the current month because the month is not completed okay so we have eight and then I just do you you can you can do the months or you can open another one up and what do we have here H we have the real date of the months okay so eight is equal to the current months and this current month is equal to my level this cell which is the latest month of data great if I go back to my base and then this one I'm using the the formula called e dat so e date means I'm going to add another month to this one okay I Ed this formula before it's just to have the the automat and then I do the same for this for this and this okay then I need to have okay what is the number of the months so I just do equal months of this d i my must number you could use the formula weak as well if you have a weak number weak week n we do like this and I was going to give you the week 31 okay same principle I'm going to do like this and I'm going to reduce that so now we do have I have my month number and I need to combine with my electri city bike and my month 8 okay so how do we do the next what we're going to do we're going to connect this with my my seasonality table and that's why when you can see there is a a colum called link and this link if I go for example to Mountain B I just did the name of the my subcategory subcategory concatenate with one so I'm going to do it again for you equal subcategory name concatenate with this specific character one then I have M back one two o like this so now I have a link that I can use to connect this with my basis 100 okay now let's go back to my file and I'm going to do you have multiple way you could also use index match if you are comfortable with that but I'm going to keep it simple for everyone you can follow my Excel expert course if you want let's take for example the month of September let's zoom and let's just look first the seasonality factor so let's do V up oops no help I don't need help I'm strong and then we're going to do the category seasonality concatenate with the number of the top this one and this is all Dynamic when you're going to refresh everything is going to change automatically you have nothing to do manual so this is my this is the the information I'm looking for then I go to my seasonality tab and it's very important to have all your seasonality tab in the same column then you can look up all of them in the in the same time so you select this to this so this one to this one and you want to have the column number three so three zero enter and now I can see that this specific number is 114% so electricity bike for September is 114 let's double check Electric City bike for September 114 my friends we made it we made it and know it's super easy we're going to go back to the previous formula I'm going to copy my value cup make sure you lock before this row so row number eight nice then I'm going to copy my formula up and you remember the previous formula was average demand um the average demand I'm going to unzoom a bit so I multiply the average Demand with all the correction I did before if you don't have the same maturity if you think if you think it's too complicated you can just multiply as explained before by the 12 months quantity average 12 months plus 23% 1 plus 23% of my growth from my Trend times and you copy and paste the video cup of my seasonality nice I know you have to be careful it was on the months of August so you just have to move this one here okay you press enter and I think I also have to lock this one F4 to make sure I not moving the colum of selection in my other tab nice now I have this I can do like this right click formula and boom look at my look at my forecast now we have a seasonality which is a seasonality of my electric city bike so it's different why because we don't start from January we start from August so we do have a city like this and the peak is m+ 5 no the lowest point is January M plus 5 is January and the lower point you could you could change even the scale like this you could say I'm going to do like this okay I know you have the correct months so you're very low during um Christmas and you're very high during summer and Springtime you can change the format of this one and now we already have an amazing forecast we have if I go back to the summary of this what is my we do have the level at the item level with all the correction availability outliers all of stock we have the trend in percentage and we do have the seasonality and now we have a really really cool for a very solid forecast that is automatically apply to all your product all your 500 products have the same let's have a look the kit for example so this is my kit seasonality with a big pick for Christmas wef let's have a look on the water bottle what's happening yeah I didn't con I didn't select the right like this let's have a look on the the flat ones we do have flat ones right so if I look the one is completely flat which is something sometimes I want I have a new category I don't know what's going to be the behavior I want something very flat and now you have you have a super powerful tool because if you change one it's going to change all the category in the same times so that's what I wanted to show you in this episode and I see you for another one
okay so now we have the the seasonality I want you to go back to a very specific parameters this is an advanced episode this is not mandatory to apply that to your to your forecast but there is something called de seasonaly uh coefficient this season analiz coefficient what this is about is if you decide to select less than 12 months for example if you go to 6 months or 3 months there is a specific parameters why because uh if you don't take a full year I'm going to take one example with the seasonality let's take for example mountain bike okay so this is mountain bike if you are if you are like in April and you take the last three months now let's take yeah no let's take the like let's say you are in April and you want to forecast you are doing the average sales of the last three months okay the problem is when you look at the average sale of the last three months they are very very low compared to the overall activity of this family so my average will be in the past 500,000 K but in the future it's almost the double almost 800k okay so the problem when you do 12 months there is no problem because you have the full you don't have any seasonality in a 12 month forecast you repeat all the the cycle inside the average CS but if you take three months or or 6 months you may have this problem that you don't really what is in the past will be different in the future at least at the level side so what we call you can Des seasonaly your average sales if you don't take a full year and that's what I'm doing in my specific file which make it maybe a bit more complex for most of you so this is clearly not mandatory but I wanted to go to the next step for the one who who want to go to the next step I recommend for most of you to keep 12 months whatever you working with or in um in in the month monthly average sales but I I just wanted to show you that if you select three six months and you have strong seasonality or three I would recommend to deseasonalize automatically and I have this 96% parameters how do I get this 96% so basically I'm going to use my three month forecast times 96% to have my average demand okay and then also the correction of avability so how do I do that how do I get this 96 I'm going to lower by 4% my average sales on this specific one how do I do that I go back to seasonality and on the right you can see you have percentage 12 six and 3 months let's take the 31 let's say we are right now we are in August so let's take the 31 in August for mountain bike and you can see 79% if you look at the formula it's very simple I'm going to do the average of the next three months with the the the current one included divided by the last three the last three in the past and in this specific case we have we are bigger in the past than in the future okay so you can see we are here I think this is eight yes so this one are bigger than the one in the future so the idea is really okay if you do the average C here it's going to go down and we need to consider that whatever the trend of this family we are going to sell probably less the next few months because you only take the last three months average so what we're going to we just apply this parameter 79% to your average sales and then we're going to have like something deseasonalized that do not consider the seasonality uh because I mean that will consider the seasonality to make sure that you have more or less according to your seasonality pattern if you have a 6 months you will do the same I'm going to do in the middle you're going to take the last six versus the next six okay if you are at the end of this year for example for this one you will have to pick the last two plus the one from last year divided by the last three okay if you are here you're going to take the current one plus this one divided by this one okay and for the 2 one you can check my formula I do like this so This selector really helped me like 63 and two that I don't have to do very complex calculation at the end I have these parameters of adjustment and then when I go back to my file I have this if I select 3M then I'm going to do a concatenation of electricity bike and my current months and my current months is eight so I do concatenate category cality and my current months like we did before for seasonality but always for the current months and then I'm going to say if my seasonality is equal to 6 M I'm going to use six for my V cup otherwise 3 m 7 and 2 m eight so what are these three numbers very simple otherwise I'm going to use five and five is 100% so what are these three numbers six 78 is just a v up from this table and this is my first link 1 2 3 4 5 six so 6m means I'm going to take the colon six otherwise 3 m colon 7 and two two months I'm going to take if I have a two month average sales I'm going to take the colon eight and if I have no I have something else I'm going to take the colon five and the colum five you just take 100% okay so I'm going a bit fast but this is the the ID of it if I take 12 there is no change I'm going to multiply this by this if I go to 6 months I'm going to do this 56 time 94 no not of this of this one up I'm going to mply 6 months time 94% so at the end it's 57 if I go to 3 months I'm going to do 89 * 96 so 85 and if I do the last two months I'm going to do like this 114 * 95% okay so this is a way to De seasonaly automatically you have multiple way to do it this is one of my way this is probably way too complex for you and to be honest most of the time I'm going to use a forecast for 12 months for 95% of the case uh so I would not I will not bother myself if you already think this is too much for you okay so I think this is good for this one and I see you for another episode
all right Mario so now let's talk about seasonality that's a big topic for Mario you have more than plus 100 Millions products to sell how do you cope with all these groups uh do you have any advice I know you use a lot of machine learning but do you have any advice to improve your cluster your group to make it more accurate yeah so um in uh in companies like Amazon basically the the machine learning algorithms uh create cality itself we don't know it's a black box right so we think he does it okay um what yes so the I think the inputs that takes into account so basically what you should do is kind of clustering okay because the previous version of these algorithms that were a bit similar and we knew more or less what they were doing uh they were basically clustering okay so they were taking inputs from the item itself okay um then um creating clusters of similar items with similar seasonality yeah and then making specific seasonality for those groups for each group individually okay so I think with the new algorithms is exactly what they should do maybe what we can also do is to switch off this functionality for some products and then switch it on for others change it more frequently things that the old algorithms couldn't do once it's set in a specific group it stays there forever and now it's a bit more uh uh changing okay uh yeah uh uh again the the the more valuable inputs uh first and foremost is item name especially the name okay yeah the name the name of the item especially for companies that work on the internet that gives you a lot of information about the product right so maybe let's take we're taking the fun example just before we're just looking together like you can see I just put fan on amazon.com in the US and this is what we can see we have a very long name with a lot of information and was checking sometimes you don't have a long name what was the it was the fanwell yeah this one no h Honeywell yeah because Honeywell it's a wellestablished brand um I think black black BOS maybe for weather related uh uh consumer products um so they have this habit of not putting things that meaning meaningful uh information in the item name yeah ht900 it doesn't mean anything for people outside onell that don't work for onell Turbo Force well Turbo Force okay why not air circulation fun of course is a fun okay uh so they put the brand on fun and black it's the only three information uh that they put in there if you compare it with any other one uh for the one is next is like yeah it's it's a very good counter example uh this one is from a like a Chinese brand of course they really really good at marketing these uh products so they put uh uh they put the decibel how much noise it makes what kind of speed uh the the air is circulating uh how much is rotating 90 degrees how many speeds modes it has so a lot of very useful information and all the algorithms I mean not only the forecasting algorithms but also the search algorithms everything you know uh takes this this information uh uh into account so the importance of item name there are other criteria but itm is is is key definitely yeah and I think like they also add multiple times fan fan fan three or maybe four times in the same code as well so the name is important and I think uh like if I go back to the example from I will survive um when I see this Bas we have a short name but at least we have a clear name and I can see like for for retail or E business they have no choice than to do it otherwise they are just invisible and I think we should learn a lot from companies like Amazon um for like for example a manufacturing company to have the same principle to make your name your category and your subcategory as clear as possible uh to standardize this uh so you you are talking about the name you have any other things that may be interesting for the clustering of your seasonality yeah if if they're not contained in the name or or is a bit un structuring the name of course category sub category or King uh then you might have things like uh uh the brand uh the launch date when when was the the product first launched was it in summer was it in winter it's it's it's key also okay sometimes even the color the color might might play at all or the weight of the item the material yeah the style you say like the color can influence the cluster you think it might you know during Christmas you might sell more red items or Halloween more orange items or I don't know there is the World Cup and then every team has its own color right so you might sell things that are not exactly labeled as being word cap but they're similar color so they people they might buy just for it so yeah it might play a role so it may play a role and that's a very uh interesting one and also so like basic information the machine learning will just find his way automatically and as you say you don't know but you you guess that you probably use this kind of information do you think the description is something that they use as well at Amazon they do they do use it uh um although I think it's much less uh important and reliable as the item name okay because you can put things that are not really meaningful here sometimes it's very short sometimes it's very long it's also very expand expensive to compute since there are so many words so yeah I would if if I had to choose I would definitely choose it name 100 times um description yeah it's it's a nice to have and what about what about the picture do you think you are using the the picture to Define clusters group of seasonality that would be the in my opinion it's the future it's the future like if you use a a super HD picture maybe can grasp the the even the texture of the material of the item to me like I think in the future the the only few things that uh uh the the objects need is like a a picture the brand maybe the price you know I don't know uh a few things just just a few thing but with the picture I think everything gets into the picture and then if there are some things that don't get through the pictures you maybe through two or three pictures you might get it okay different angles If the product changes a little bit moves right different uh setups and then maybe you can get most of it out of the pictures but it's completely I think it's the future but it will it's completely different for what we have today okay which is more is more uh input like a data input even okay even pictures are turning we are predicting the future and maybe there is a business if you are following this course you want to do a cluster image seasonality business forecasting uh so you have the cluster is the most important part and in the calculation of the seasonality uh do you have any recommendation or I guess maybe you correct from avability as well or do you have any um no not any specific because I was working with algorithms that they were doing all this by themselves so I I don't remember of any specific things that have to be taken into account for calculation of the so that's the calculation we use at the end is pretty basic the most challenging is to to combine them and what do you see like for intermittent product they don't have directly a a seasonality because they don't sell at all do you think they should be connected to any seasonality in the well yeah yes I I think if you think at the if you think at intermittent product for example when you when you create the forecast for intermittent product products okay um you might think it in probabilistic terms so what is the probability of selling one in six months okay or one in the next year okay depending okay so you might say that there is a higher probability if it is a summer related product there is a higher probability during summer and then this after summer this probability of selling the item for the next in the next six months drops to zero okay for example or uh to make it even simpler not speaking talking about abilities you can think about this product is selling I don't know 0.1 each week okay of course is not the case you cannot sell 0.1 products but 1.1 it means that you know after 10 weeks you sold one okay okay so you might be 0 one during summer and then you may be 0.0 during winter for example so already uses the kind of seasonality okay nice interesting thank you for sharing that and thank you for this insight for the seasonality and we see you for another episode
all right so in this chapter we're going to optimize and try different focusing model like we did previously where we were comparing different model and see which one had the best accuracy and we were comparing from very basic to a very Advanced one so what we did for now we did something close to the average 12 months plus season plus seasonality and growth and we want to compare first with different model and then we're going to optimize different parameters that we use during this file so if I go back to this file if you go back to the the original version before moving all the formulas it looks more complex why oops because because I just have this condition that say if you have a change on the right we're going to override forecast after so I have this long formula but at the end you can keep it simple and you can go back to the original formula with no if so you remove all of this you can do it with me and you remove one like this so you have the average demand that we correct from just to keep in mind the average demand is the is the 12 months corrected by avability and um also we did some cleaning with the the O lers to make sure we don't have crazy numbers times the the gross so the trend is the gross plus 23% that we were talking just before and the v c of the seasonality uh which is the subcategory seasonality so now we have this formula I'm going to copy and paste so this is the same one I just don't have all the if to override the forecast after that we're going to see later so I'm going to do like this you should do the same right click formula and now we have this forecast that we want to compare with something else so what are we going to do on the right side you have another one called forecast Excel Auto Plus seasonality this is a forast a forecast I've created myself this is a mix between the power of Excel and uh the the IDE of seasonality that we did just before and the idea is to compare different forecast but we're going to keep it simple at the beginning let's compare just this equal to 12 months forecast we're going to just take the 12 months forecast with no correction okay so we do like this up 56 we do like this we copy the P formula and know the idea is like do we really need a very complex formula maybe this is even let's take like this insert I'm going to do a shart again select data switch row and columns doesn't work yes so we have the first forecast I want to compare this one with so this one is called let's call it ABC and then another one called average for example average and the value is this one okay so now I want to compare these two for but not only the challenges I don't want to compare only for one product I want to compare for this one and I want to comp compete like what is the the availability of the different model but I also want to compare with for example this one and this one which one is the best so the idea is like how to how to compare what like we did before in the forecasting model how to do it in the scale we and you can do it with not only one product but 10 but even 500 if maybe you have 10,000 products and you want a very efficient way to do it so in the next episode what we're going to do I'm going to teach you how to do it by using what a method I created for that in Excel and I'm going to tell you how to do it in a very uh simple way and efficient way that you can compare and optimize your model
okay so in this episode we're going to start by preparing the data and splitting the data to test the availability of different model what we did before I don't know if you remember but we were saying oh we should keep maybe the last 12 months to track the accuracy of this in my specific case I'm going to pick only 6 months why because it's a lot of data and I I was checking the 12 and I I didn't see a big difference and for this specific case because I don't have a lot of sales history on my file because I only work with the last two years for the trend for example I prefer to take to take six months so what we're going to do we're going to track from this month to this month so we're going to get thata into the past the sales we have in the past from February to July and the idea is to really compare what happened during this period with our forecasting model and see which one is the best you can of course decide the pair you have the more you have a sales history in your file the more you can extend but I feel for me 6 months times 500 item it's a lot of data point to see if my my model is working correctly or not so what we're going to do now we're going to first prepare the the the data point we're going to copy all the catalog and we're going to do it step by step together and then we're going to get the sales and the forecast I'm going to tell you all we can simulate the forecast in the past because you have two options or you wait for the future and you try the accuracy and you see which one is the best but you have to do multiple forecast and it's going to take a while or you go back to the past and you compare what is what was the accuracy in the past to see which model is the best okay so we're going to do uh we're going to get the sales then we're going to get the forecast ABC then the another forecast Excel could be the average forecast at the beginning and then we're going to track the absolute error per period and per product we're going to do the same for the Boss model and then we're going to get all the error we're going to calculate all of this and then we're going to go back to a pivot table and we're going to track which one has the best accuracy 57 52 and we're going to then optimize these parameters so how to prepare the data first what you have to do we're going to insert a new tab we're going to do it from scratch then we're going to go to base and in this tab make sure that you respect the ascending order of your item code then you don't get confused after so I just press ascending or because we're going to copy and paste a lot of data or you you add an extra ID 1 2 3 4 5 to make sure that you never lose the same order when you're going to copy and paste value after okay so we do like this and then I'm going to copy all my informations I'm going to copy all of this into my sheet one so you do like this you can copy like this and right click and paste value then you have the format and all of this then we're going to clean what we don't need we're going to keep the comment because in the commment we have some interesting information avability we can remove I mean I could keep avability let's keep avability if you want to optimize that let's keep ABC we didn't do ABC analysis we're going to do it later but just for your information sales price so now we have all of these great so that was the first step is to get the the catalog then what we need to get we need to have the sales these sales we had in the past so from February to July you could do the same for one here but I I did it before and it was a it was enough for me it was almost the same so I'm going to do like this first I'm going to insert a new row T you can do it with me very important you practice again don't be lazy or maybe you think it's too much that's why you have to repeat maybe it's too easy for you maybe you do that with python good for you so we're going to copy just the value in the pass but when you do that be very careful so you could do a v up from the level tab directly yes you could do that but I'm I want to I'm kind of lazy so I want to I want to take this tab directly because I have the same layout what I'm going to do first you need to remove the outliers parameters CU we had the two two times the um the standard deviation to avoid this extreme value so you need to remove that and switch to let's put 9999 very important okay so now you don't have any outlayer cleaning because the the extreme value is super high and we're going to just now copy and paste all the value you can see six but the maximum value six so we are not really cleaning this one okay so we're going to copy contrl V right click past value we're going to remove the conditional formatting because we don't need this for okay so now we have what we call the sales right sales it's not the demand because we don't have the correction from avability but at least we have a we have a good starting point now the next step is to get what we call the forecast but how do we get the forecast in the past that's a very good question and I have a very easy solution for you how do we generate forecast CU this forecast is from August if we open this is from August to J to um July but I want to have my forecast more into the past so what is the secret I'm going to show it now we all of this is connected to one tab called level the the current month today is August right but if I go back to this tab and now I'm going to f I'm going to pretend where are in the past so what we're going to do we're going to select this and we're going to unselect the the last 6 months 1 2 3 4 5 6 and by doing that I'm going to I'm going to pretend that now we are not in August we are in February you can see we are in February and when I go back to my base all my forecast change automatically nice so you see I don't have to do a very complex mechanic and know I can see the the next six month forecast is February to July super easy I know what I'm going to do I'm going to copy this so February to the next six months and this is the forecast I want to check so we're going to go back to this copy okay because I have formulas and then you just copy the value then you don't have the prime of the formulas great so now I have my abc forecast and we're going to do the same for this one six copy and paste value so this one is I'm going to merge forecast uh I call it ABC ABC or Ed and this is the forecast 2 forecast two we can call it also Excel because uh in my in my one in this one I call it forus Excel because I'm using the the Excel formula the automatic Excel formula okay so at the end you have Focus one Focus two and that's what we did and know we're already the the challenge will be for us now to compare okay that was the sales this is the forecast I want to compare to know which one is the best this one is the average forecast and this one is the most advanced forecast that we did who's going to win we're going to see that in the next episode
okay so now we have all the data the sales the forecast and the forecast Excel keep in mind we're going to do the exact same principle that we did before we're going to first track we know when we're comparing different model we're going to first track the the error between the forecast and the revenue then we're going to transform the absolute value of the of the error and then we're going to track the accuracy of this model not only for one but for 500 products okay so we do the same so for that we just just copy and paste this and this T we're going to reduce the Gap and what do I want to do I want to do this minus this so in this one I have one a quantity eror of one okay but the thing I have negative values so we're going to use the formula abs for absolute I know we have the absolute value great we can do like this and now we have all the absolute value for forast ABC or forast Edward CH there is a copy there is a copyright for my forast be careful you have to name it each time you use it I'm going to talk to Microsoft to create the Ed forecast then you don't have to do all this all of these is going to be automatic that would be nice that would be really cool all right but before that let's keep it simple we do like this we do the same for this one make sure you compare with the the same column and the same parod otherwise going to be completely wrong you do like this and you do like this great so now we have this two absolute uh error error and know what is missing first what we can do we can already check oh but what is the what is the total of it so you can see I have some error I have have an have some error why because we are comparing I guess we have no data so if you have no data you have two options or you replace all all the no by zero or you just consider that because it was not for sale I don't want to track the accuracy okay so what I'm going to do I'm going to go back to this I'm going to say if if error then zero cuz I don't want to track If the product was not for sale okay so I do like this bom and I do the same here if error then zero okay and now let's let's have a look what is the total of this the sum of this is 61,000 and the sum of this 6,900 oo so it looks like the second one is maybe even better maybe it's even better why why the average 12 months is better than the this complex formula Ed what what are you playing with us that and I don't want to play with you but I just want to show you the truth and the truth is the accuracy right so at the end we have this and know what what is missing we need to have the sum of uh we going in the next episode we're going to track the accuracy not in quantity but also in value not only by products but overall and that's what we're going to do next
okay so now we're going to track the accuracy of all these products and what we're going to do we're going to insert six new colons 1 2 3 4 5 six and I want to do the same than this one so we're going to do this six colum I'm going to explain to you clck you can also do like this format cell alignment R text so I need the the total of the the forecast in quantity for both then I need in value and then I need the total demand in quantity and value that's what I need to calculate the forecast okay we're going to so what we're going to do we're going to do sum of my forecast of this one t i do the same for this one for this oh no I was wrong I need to the sum of the error okay so this is the error absolute ABC and this is the error okay so I need the sum of the error of the this one okay and I need also the sum of the error for the other forecast okay great now I have this I need in value so how do I do in value I just do this times the price the sales price okay and I do the same this times sales price so now I have the 27 absolute error in quantity and in value and now I just need the total demand as well to make my calculation so I have uh some of my sales in quantity and in value is going to be this times price nice so now I have all of this I can do like this and I have everything I need to create my accuracy you could already have a look you can say what is the sum in value the sum in value is like 11 Millions 11500 millions and this one is 11 million we are very close in in value as well we have almost the same uh the same value but we're going to do it in a more efficient way using a pivot table so how we're going to do that we're going to create going to select this tab we don't need all of this just this from shift down and you're going to select this tab going to create insert pivot table from table and Ranch you you can get this selection you can even add more rows if you if you are not sure to have like you can say no you know what maybe I will have more products coming so you can select more or the full colum if you want nice and now what we're going to do we're going to do the category for example you can remove the blank if you have blank and we're going to now calculate the total we're going to get the total error in quantity we're going to do all the quantities first up total man and then we're going to do all the value after okay so we're going to do all of this T going a bit fast you can replay the video slowly if you feel okay so now we have this hop up and know you can see you can already see that maybe not like this like this conditional formatting this way that we have a bit more error for the forecast IBC than for the the average Excel forecast uh 12 months which is interesting so we're going to we're going to explore that in the next episode but we can calculate first the accuracy so you could do like this you could even do by subcategory when we do by subcategory you have not only by category but you can see which one is the best or not and we can calculate the accuracy let's do it in quantity and value and for that you're going to divide we're going to do it just in in value and then we're going to do the the full one we're going to do accuracy dollar ABC and accuracy dollar uh Excel the second formula average and what we're going to do we're going to divide this value so E4 divided by G j4 going to do like this so we have and then we do one because this is zero one minus this to have the accuracy I teach that before you do like this and know you have all your accuracy I'm going to do the same for this one oops for the second one nice and now you can see that you have total you have the same accuracy between these two method for now I'm going to explain to you why we have the same and I forgot to do something that's why also we have the same but it's always good to know and you can see for example the main winter closing minus 52% for the the average forecast why if you go back back to this one and we take winter categories for example uh woman winter closing you can see that having a very uh in this one we have a switch to colon so we have we have a good seasonality thanks to the season of the subcategory and for this one we don't have anything that's why the accuracy is not great because the there is no seasonality into this the same forecast so we have one very flat and one that is that is following the seasonality and it's something very predictable for the winter season that's why we have a very poor accuracy for the the the second meod than the first one but overall we almost have the same result so it's going to be interesting but before that I'm going to explain to you how to use calculate field to have an automatic accuracy calculation
okay so now in this episode we're going to calculate the accuracy not with this manual formula why because it's not very convenient if I remove this it's going to be a mess so what we're going to do we're going to insert new rows and I'm going to teach you how to use the calculate field if you never follow my training before this is a very useful one for pivot table what we're going to do now we're going to go to we're going to go to pivot table analyze field items and sets C Cal calculated field and now what we're going to do we're going to call it accuracy ABC quantity and we're going to do the same formula so we're going to divide the sum of all the quantity divided by sum of all the quantity of the demand I mean sales and demand is the same this specific case and we're going to do one minus this res to have it in accuracy and not error we're going to do add so now we have one now we're going to do the Excel 2 and then we're going to just switch this one by this one add then we're going to do dollar ABC and we're going to remove all of this by total of the demon in value divided by total of no total of the the error divided by the total of the demand add and then we're going to do excel 2 of this and this I'm going to press add now we press okay and boom we have all of this we switch to percentage you can use the paint like this taada I know we have all the accuracy that we want we can you can use a conditional formatting like this CL and now you can see we have the same result than this one you see like for the value 51 51 46 45 and you can you can see the idea of this is much more efficient to use because now if I want to addde the subcategory boom I cannot I just need to add the format again if it doesn't work you go to this value setting and you go to percentage here number format percentage I don't do it because uh I want to go fast for you as well I don't want to spend too much time but you you can see now the accuracy it's interesting quantity and value you don't have a big difference between these two capis in this specific case so I'm going to so they you don't have a big difference in terms of value uh you can see because the category are quite have the same kind of price in the same category and yeah and at the end now you can compare very quickly you can deep dive into one category you could even uh display specific products if you need and uh there will be something very we can do products to see how it looks uh let's do maybe it's going to crash I don't know item name and know for and you could say oh you know what I want to have the category for example winter into filter and now I have the accuracy of all my products except the one with no value you could do for example M options descending by item demand quantity up and know you can see for example for the woman closing C the accuracy of the let's say in value like 59 accuracy for the ABC only 16% for the second method so you can really deep dive with this formula and in the next one what we're going to do we're going to start optimizing the parameters and I'm going to teach you I'm going to tell you why we don't have much difference between the average 12 months and and my specific for formula and optimize all of that that's
okay so now let's go back to the normal table I'm going to remove the it time name subcategory here so we have this results and you're going to ask me again Ed but Ed why are you doing all of this because the 12 months focus is Pretty good overall we have big problem with seasonal product such as winter but for the rest of it it's not too bad right why why do we need to have a complex formula and my answer is maybe you don't need a complex formula and uh I see a lot of people looking for the perfect formula and sometimes the best one is not the most complex one why why is it not that better as well because these kind of products are really not stable so I think stability is very important if you have very intermittent product and also I did a mistake on purpose I forgot to mention that I I didn't add a specific parameter which is very important when you look at the the forecast I forgot to go back to the outlier cleaning so we are using this to remove layers if there more than twice the standard deviation and when I copy and paste the formula I forgot to to copy again this um this forus with the out layer cleaning so what we're going to do now we're going to optimize this parameter and see if it's better if you have a better forus accuracy if we go back to this outlier cleaning okay so now you can see okay now we are cleaning or we have an automatic cleaning of the forecast make sure before you copy the forecast that you are in the same descending options of my items okay and now we're going to just copy again like this control shift down contrl C and I'm going to go back to my to this tab and this time I'm going to replace only the forecast ABC so I'm going to right click like this and now I changed my forecast only of this one and we're going to compare with this one to see if we have better results I'm going to go back to this right and what I'm going to do I'm going to copy this so we can we can remove this block we don't need it anymore and what we're going to do we're going to copy this block but to make sure you don't copy as a pivot table I'm going to for example add an item statue code and let's see if we have a change if we only check the active once active we don't have much different so I recommend maybe to only keep the active but because we're in the past that's that's a that's a calculation you have to try and see if you have a big difference or not so now I'm going to copy this table to keep the result like this CL and I'm going to call it uh forecast no out layer cleaning okay so that that's the result with no outlier cleaning and this is my result now I'm going to refresh refresh this tab going to un Zoom a bit and see if now with the new forecast with outlier cleaning we have a better result or not so I'm going to do like like this right click and boom now we have 53% availability and we are two points better than the average 12 months so we move now we have also $300,000 do less error for this specific uh for my abc forecast versus the the average 12 month forecast which is very interesting right right so what we can do now is say you know what I like this one so I'm going to copy this one paste and then this time I'm going to call it forecast uh two uh two standard or two parameters okay so we have a two two parameters why because we use the number two we use the max max is number is a two twice the standard deviation but now you're going to ask me maybe we can go even deeper maybe we can go to 1.5 so let's go to 1.5 and see if we have we have a better results right so let's go to 1.5 and let's do the process again I really recommend you to try with me as well the is really there is no rocket science at one point you need to try and and test and we're going to go back to cheat one copy and paste and then go back to base no sheet two and see we had so 10,991 refresh and we improve Again by $80,000 the the total error of the of this okay so it's very interesting that's the way you can optimize of course I'm going to talk about overfitting you can spend your life optimizing these parameters but it just give you an idea okay first is it a big change or not this this change was not massive the the biggest one was to add the cleaning outliers cleaning at the end uh $80,000 above $1 million is not a massive change so it won't change your life to be honest but it's good to know that now our our forecasting model is getting a bit better and we can now um try to optimize even better the the parameters also what we can see for example the fun holder was really bad why it was really bad because I put in the future a like a very aggressive Trend if I go back to my Trends on purpose we decided to have a strong ambition for the phone older process right and so we put 100 when the the trend was only 5% so maybe we I can try and say you know what I'm going to go back to five to see if this is uh if this is better because the marketing plan was in the future but not 6 months before so let's go back to this one and let's go back to the my base and let's see if my focus is better so you can copy and paste again the the formula like this not the formula the value paste and now let's see if the font holder was 7% of accuracy for my model and 57 for the the average 12 months let's refresh and boom now we almost have the same okay also what you can do to improve that you say maybe I should remove you have very exceptional sales and we we do have product with comments you know like team sales for example maybe I should remove that from my from my comparison or all of stock for a very long time so then you have you have no limit to check but for example what you could do if you have more information when you want to optimize a model try to remove the exceptional things such as like commands and remove them you just select the blank one and by selecting the blank one so you have 10.9 million and you can see when we have only the blank one know of accuracy move from 53 to 57% and I feel it's more relevant to optimize your forus only on the on the normal po because if you already have the information that there was there was was something crazy in the past I will maybe avoid this kind of exceptional sales or exceptional shortage on this product so it's also very important the way you're going to select your product to optimize your your model because if you do it on unpredictable item which has one one sales from one huge customer that was impossible to plan you don't want to train your model based on this specific case of course don't look for Perfection but this is just an example that at the end my overall accuracy is more is closer to 60 % rather than than um in value you can see in value 60 in quantity 57 rather than 50 or even 45% okay so I hope you like this example there is no limit for exploration and in the next one we're going to compare we're going to create another forecast and compare if it's even better than my forecast Edward J ABC superation forecast
okay so now in this episode we're going to try to compare versus another forecast okay so if I go back to my forecasting model we working before we had multiple models and you know what I'm going to compare my model with the triple exponential smoothing from Excel you know the one we're doing automatically with this specific formula forecast etss and let's see if I can beat Excel if I can be a better forecaster and I can keep my job and not not be replaced by a machine okay you can do it with whatever the model you want and we're going to replace that so for that first I need to open this I recommend once again to practice with me okay we're going to open this and we're going to open as well this and now we're going to do the forast formula so we're going to call it forecast forecast ETS you can this one what is the target date it's my new par so keep in mind we are using parent numbers so 25 enter what is what are my values in the past we use the last 24 months from one no values this one we are not selecting the month to dat because this month is not complete and we're going to keep the outliers correction because I feel this is relevant and more more accurate for the focus so I'm going to help Excel because I'm I'm a nice guy and then I'm going to do the timeline and the timeline is the period above and the seasonality we're going to ask to find the seasonality automatically by pressing one Excel is going to look for his own seasonality pattern if it doesn't find not going to apply any seasonal uh coefficient to the forecast we press okay now we do have the forecast and we're going to lock the formula the row and we're going to Lo this nice going to do like this formula nice and now we do have so we do have the Excel for the automatic Excel forast the triple exponential smoothing with a seasonal detection and we have my forus and we're going to see which one is the best right so let's go back to this we going to we still have the previous par so we can keep like this and we're going to copy my formula you can see we have negative values which is not a good sign and we're going to do like this CL okay so now we do have this we're going to go back to my sheet number two what we can do I'm going to copy this one t t I'm going to go best result 1.5 deviation no uh no Trend uh 100% uh phone holder okay you can you can do something cleaner than me but I want just want to go fast T and now we're going to just refresh this time and see which one is the best is it Edward t or is it Microsoft the B the multi-billions company right click ha you can see so this one didn't change ABC and mine I'm 14 points better like in millions I'm like 2.5 Millions better than the Microsoft multi-billions company you see so I still have a few years in front of ahead of me to to work as a forecaster and uh yeah my forus is much better basically by far by really far much better like the triple exponential smoothing optimize automatically it's pretty bad with Excel for example look at even this one it doesn't C with seasonality so the limit is only gave two uh two months of like two years sorry of seasonal history so it was more difficult to find the seasonality and in the next episode we're going to try to optimize this automatic forecast from Microsoft to see if we can get it closer to my results
okay so now what we're going to do we're going to go back to my forecast and we look like like the seasonality doesn't work pretty well sometimes we are better you know the lockers for example the automatic triple expon musing did a much better accuracy but it was on a very small volume to be honest so let's go back to my base and this time what we're going to do first what we can do we can remove the negative value and then we can remove the seasonality as well so first I'm going to do that's why my formula is a bit longer if this I just copy and paste this less than zero then zero otherwise this so I just say you know what if you have a negative value just put zero T now we don't have any negative value if I go back to sheet two so we had 10 point like 46% of accur see let's refresh refresh I didn't copy the value of course I need to copy taada of course you could also even automate this process I didn't automate the process with power query but I think this is enough for me or you could do a macro that we copy and paste so now we have 46% 10 m 100,000 refresh Now we move to 47 so we made one little point of prog with really far from my own forecast what we're going to do next we're going to maybe remove the seasonality pattern from Excel to see maybe uh it's just wrong so let's go back to the base and in my formula I'm going to go back to this formula here and the seasonality pattern you can move to zero zero means I don't want to see any seas seasonality in your calculation okay so basically it's a double exponential smoothing don't forget to also disable this one because we have twice the same formula and let's copy and paste the formula okay now I go back to my uh first I need to copy my forecast right click value we have 47 10 Millions refresh H 48% we're really far from this okay so what we're going to do next we're going to we're going to use because I I feel Excel is too weak versus my own forecast so I'm going to help excel in I say you know what you know what bro I'm going to give you my own seasonality because uh you don't you don't get it you don't get it so what we're going to do we're going to use you know my vup of seasonality this one I'm going to give it to excel cuz I'm a nice guy so I'm going to go back back to this and all this forecast here I'm going to I'm going to multiply by my seasonality why because I disabled the seasonality before so we're going to do like this and you can see now the forecast is moving right click and now we do have a very similar forecast let's give a try for this one and t t sometimes very different sometime not but at the end yeah let's see the second one yeah sometimes very different sometimes it's not and at the end let's see if the the accuracy is better contrl C okay so we were at 40 uh 48% 9 9 Millions refresh 52% so you can see that now I help Excel to go to a better accuracy it's really far from my own accuracy but at the end you know what I'm improving the model and I'm pretty um I'm pretty proud of it because uh it was it was it was really bad at the beginning but at the end mine is more stable and more I feel more resilient as well uh so at the end I'm going to keep mine for this specific one and in the next episode I'm going to tell you how to go how to go with um optimiz optimization and also to be how to be very careful with over fitting
okay so now in this episode congratulation you understand how to compare different forecast or to optimize parameters the risk you can have you to say you know what edar I can always find a better solution and you will never stop you will never stop optimizing and yes you could always improve you maybe you could put for example 1.45 you can also try to optimize your your level selection maybe maybe not 12 month maybe 2 four months maybe you should you can improve your Trend analysis maybe you can also improve your seasonality and I just warn you don't don't be too obsessed to find the perfect perfect solution you can try also to use maybe the Excel solver but it's going to crash for most of your computer because you have so much data right now that is going to last forever I know we're getting very close to the machine learning uh optimization when you need a lot of machine power to test many many different parameters the risk of overfitting is like to find the perfect perfect avability for like avability accuracy sorry for for something that happened in the past and what we call overfitting is like you try to have you have a model very complex that will perfectly reply to what happened in the past but when you do that and you have another event which is not very common it will completely crash in the future so over fitting is when you try to do too much optim optimization and it's too optimized for the past but not enough for the future that's why I try to keep keep it as well simple because when you keep it simple it will not completely um overreact for example if you have another event that happen in the future for example for the average sales I like to use the 12 months because it's very stable for the the old lers I use from my experience and this is from my experience I like to use two instead of 1.5 because some from specific items you like you need to have this variation and at the end we didn't see a big difference between a two and 1.5 was only a $90,000 of error in the past but we don't know for the future so be very careful that don't don't be obsessed to have the perfect value at the end you should really focus on the main Gap when you have eight points difference yes this is the differ but when you move by 0.01% the accuracy at the end you are very close to the to the source so I think that was the that was the thing I wanted to tell to tell you also another question I got from my members is maybe you don't have the same accuracy for all your products so maybe you you say you know what maybe for water bottle I only have solid 2% of accuracy maybe there is a better model just for or for example for the locks you say maybe you know for the lockers I could only use the the average 12 months because my accuracy is much better so you could do that it's a much much more advanced um practice because then you're going to have multiple models in your file uh I was doing that when I was very um Advanced and and you have to keep in mind and then you will have to maintain a very different file when I change the formula at the top I have an automatic um duplication from the bottom so you won't be able to do that anymore so the maintenance will be more difficult so I will not go into this game right now for most for 99% of you but if you're already do doing a python and a lot of optimization that that's something that you could do and to be honest that's what machine learning is doing he has he can create his own different models by type of category but this is more complex I also know FL forecasting software we try for example 50 different models and based on your category or subcategory even models it will give you a different model per product but I feel this is U this is very Advanced very complex and to be honest if you use this kind of forecast I'm using per week or per month for example this kind of um ABC forecast I deal with Trend seasonality and demand you optimize a bit the parameters and you clean the out layers and avability you will have a very very resilient forecast and then the most important is how to enrich the forecast with future events such as new products or promotions and that's what we're going to do in the next episode but at the end you have to keep in mind it's all about you track you test and it's not necessar the most advanced model that will have the better accuracy is just the one that works and most of the time I really like to to say that is not the the most advanced it's a very simple one
in this chapter we're going to talk about how to enrich the forecast especially focusing on promotions elasticity price per product per category and as we we did before we we did the forecast for the Baseline now it's time to improve the forecast and we're going to also analyze and try to adjust and make it even better and more efficient so what we did before as I said we we forecast the level then we included the trend in percentage then we had the seasonality and now we do have the Baseline forecast this is already a very very good start for most of you would be much better than any kind of forecast you have today but you want to go to the next level right and what we're going to do now we're going to enrich the forecast for example from commercial inputs and we're going to learn how to override the automatic forecast to have the final forecast we're going to maybe increase at the beginning and reduce uh maybe one or two months after based on any commercial activities and I wanted to go back first to what is for value added the idea of of this forecast is first of all we really focus on the the Baseline and for 90 95% of your product you will have that will be enough to improve your forus accuracy we're going to focus on level Trend and seasonality as we did before then you want to add information that maybe are not in the in your past like in your past sales or in your data history for example you you may have a new promotion coming that didn't happen last year you may have like a new price you may have maybe a new clients or new distribution Channel you maybe also have like marketing input such as like ads on Instagram on a new website maybe you're going to if you have B2B you're going to tell to your team to refocus to um to push another product of your catalog or you're going to launch new products and these new products are not part of the previous uh sales history so you the idea is really like let's say you you start from 60% and you remember in in the file we were close to 57% with the the optimization we did I know the idea is to enrich to add more value to the forecast to move to maybe 65 70 even 75 but be careful because sometimes when we had more information we can also make it worse we can uh like if I was listening always my my sales team I would definitely not have a better forecast accuracy so we need to learn how to improve it and also we need to review that's what we're going to do in the next chapters or to make sure that all these little CH that we did at the end are they relevant based on the the budget and based on the Gap analysis between the commercial Target and the statistical Trend that we have for that so when we talk about this um forecast value added we have different what we call demand drivers right and you have to think about which one are very important for you which one are really driving the demand for example promotions it could be promotion from the past and you want to correct the past sales like we did before or it could be in the future you have you have a promotion calendar that you want to apply in your next forecast price change could be part of the promotion it's not only that we're going to talk about it later and you can just s about this table and just maybe cross a a box to say yes or no marketing event maybe you have new distribution new clients maybe you have some holidays date change like for example the new school if you have a shift of the the holiday school for your specific products they may also impact your demand you can have also Stockard in the past but also you can plan shortages in advance because you don't have the capacity with the with Jack machine for example the weather forecast as well can have an impact it's very difficult to implement I try to do it with my forecasting models and it's very very very complex especially on the on the mid and long term you can also have internal competitions like let's say you are you are promoting products but they're going to impact all products you can you can create new products but they can for example if you have five bus and you move your Ranch to 10 bus they going you going to definitely have cannibalization when I was working for the catlon we had competition between the brand into the same store so the racket sport Fitness sport and SOA sport were all selling socks and they were competing each other so you can have internal competition which can be uh toxic sometimes and challenging and you can have also external competitions based on okay new your competitors are uh very aggressive with the price with a new product that copying your your patterns etc etc and also macroeconomic factors such as the pandemic the global the like a global recession that will impact your industry for example the car sales industry is very Co um has a strong correlation with the the global economy so you have a lot of factors the ideas like think about which one are important for you and then we're going to focus on the big ones especially focusing on promotion price we're going to talk also about cannibalization later new products in the next chapter but think about this table and just try to ponder which one are the most important for you the conclusion of this as well is like now we're moving to another level of forast maturity and complexity so maybe you won't be able to implement all of it but the idea is really to push you to the forecast exper level so maybe you can already keep with seasonality Trend and Baseline that there will be end the level there will be way enough for most of you but but I want to push you to the limits and I also want to keep it cable and give you the full toolbox maybe that you can come back in one or two years if you feel this is the right time for you but don't try to implement everything I'm explaining to you the next few weeks because it may be too much for your team and maybe even for you so it's okay but now let's talk about how to deal with promotions
okay so now let's talk about the challenge of dealing with promotions this is a big topic and I can tell you this is not easy I've been running promotions for retail fmcg B2B like raw material business is not easy and I don't have a magic potion but I can give you first my challenges and then how to to cope with it the first challenge is you have a big variety of promotion promotion is not only about the price right it's not only about the price and different discount can give you different what we call impact or elasticity so we're going to talk about it later when when we we were checking with Mario before about Amazon you can have a minus 50% on Amazon but if it's not on the front page no one will see that or if it's not an email newsletter with promotion no one will care about the promotion so it's also about the client and how you going to expose the product it's about the communication I was explaining you want to publish on a social media on your front page in front of your in front of your store if you B2B your commercial your sales team they're going to talk about it and say hey we have this new product if they don't talk about it no one will know and also the temporality having 50% off for one day or for two weeks is not the same impact as well so you have a big variety of promotion and the idea is like how to make it more standardized that you can really C with that the problem also is all these promotion they're going to affect the demon they're going to have like you have maybe an average Demand with a like a normal seasonality and the problem is you're going to stimulate the demand sometimes too much you because your customer they're going to wait for the next promotion if they get used to that we're going to talk about it later or to C with that also most of the time I can tell you for most of the company there is not enough analysis in the past not enough consistency poor execution not enough data as well around all this information okay but what happened in the past I don't have any information is not in any system they have spreadsheet everywhere so it's a mess for most of the time there is not enough review after the promotion not enough collaboration between departments and most of the time way too many promotion and they're not efficient enough and poly executed so this is the reality and most of the time we overreact with promotion because we have a or marketing just wants to create or sales wants to have his bonus or because we have too much inventory so we just have to get rid of everything today because we need cash flow so that's most of the situation I know and how to deal with promo that's a very good question and that was we're going to deal with Leonardo Wolf the sales director and Lady gtic first of all you need to have data so you need to collect data to really first secondly not first but secondly estimate the impact what is the impact of any different promotions you also need to simplify and standardize the inputs of these promotions we're going to go back I'm going to give you a full template that you're going to be able to apply to your company but if you don't see simplify standardize and you have 1,000 different promotions good luck it's going to be a mess you need to when you standardize input you need to standardize what is the impact of every single promotion then you need to standardize the data collection we're going to talk to sales director marketing you need they need to fill the same template all the time not a different spreadsheet and not by email you need also to implement simple override process in your forecasting tool whatever it's Excel or your EIP system you need to track the accuracy of changes and if possible you need to reduce and simplify promotions that's all we're going to talk about in the in this chapter except tracking accuracy we're going to do it later uh but I wanted to go back from that we're going to go back to basic and make it better than you are probably doing it today
okay so now let's talk about how to analyze promotions impact and data so what you need to have and I'm going to give you a simple example but you could you could spend three months of your year just analyzing promotion and the more you will spend time and analyze the more you you will be able to provide like a good quality uh forecast to improve the forecast of your promotion Mario the expert from Amazon was only focusing on this process and create an Excel file that could that could provide accurate forecast for Amazon for all the promotions and also new product so this is I could be a fulltime job if you have a big company and I spend month talking about this and analyzing this but just to give you one example what you need you don't need much information I mean you need the the so quantity and the the dollar quantity if possible the price at the time you were selling the product if you don't have it you can just divide this divided by this and you will find yeah because I'm using another way but if you divide 5,000 by 100 you will find the average price and you will find that this price is different too okay so the the first thing you can do because most of the time when there is a promotion there is also a discount most of the time you can have a price analysis average price analysis per model but you can also do it per category just to identify if you don't have any information or what happen in the past because before talking about the future we need to look into to the data in the past okay to learn and the more you have promotion in the past with information the more you can uh improve the next promotion because you know you can estimate the impact we're going to talk about elasticity of course if you already have a file with all this information of the promotion in the past and also what kind of promotion it was it's even better and we're going to talk about it later what kind of promotion you should have where was where is that yeah exactly what can if it's solo discount subcategory first page website ads Instagram whatever you are you are doing okay so you need to collect the the data and then we need to First you can add for example like this a conditional formatting to say okay the month three and the month s we had a very different average price so I guess it was a promotion then we're going to calculate what is the price change so what is the catalog price divide it you could do you could do just you have the catalog price or you could try to have a like what is the most frequent price you can also do an average price if you don't have the catalog price but most of the time you have the the the catalog price in your system okay so the price change is very simple you're going to divide this divide it by the catalog price here F4 and we're going to do minus one like this okay so you have this and you can see oh I have a minus 30% you can add another conditional formatting okay so now we have this what we can do we can create this kind of graph which is very useful to to visualize data I really like to visualize data all the time so we're going to focus on price and quantity sold okay inser the shot perfect so we have this you see there is a strong correlation between the price and the sales the more the price is going up you can change also the more the price is going down the more the the the quantity are going up and you can see also after after the down after the up sorry the down there is a down because basically customers are probably buying to much and then they wait another week or another month because they already bought it during the promotion and you can see that when you raise the price the the demand is is falling apart as well okay so this is the first good analyze that we can see on that and what we're going to do next we're going to identify okay but what is the what is the what is the elasticity what is the impact between price and the quantity and what is the secret to forecast uh if for example I want to move to I want to do promotion of minus 10% what will be the final quantity sold and what will be the elasticity of that we're going to talk about it in the next episode
okay so now let's talk about how to calculate the impact of the price versus the quantity the discount versus the the quantity so we call that the elasticity elasticity can be a very Advanced topic you could use even machine learning to calculate the elasticity but I want to keep it very simple for you and to be honest the more you try to optimize that the more you not necessarily get better result by doing a very very complex formula so what we're going to do you need to to see what is the price change we already have that and what is the quantity change the quantity change I would recommend to have like you need to identify what is the average demand without promotion so I use the formula average if and I did okay give me the average when the price is equal to the catalog price okay so now I can see average if you can see the formula if you don't know how to use it and you have 98 okay 98 is the average with a promotion the problem is you have the impact after the promotion you have the 95 uh you have the 95 after you know like you're going down a bit after but at the end or you do it manually because it's a big product and you can see the basine or you keep this formula because most of the time you don't have the exact demand each time and I didn't do it because I don't want to make it too complex but you could also deseasonalize the quantity Sal because you can also have a variation with the seasonality uh so you could also use these parameters these 100 and you could Des seasonaly to always have the base level so if you want to dealy I won't do it but it's just for the very Advanced uh expert you can go to seasonality you can check the seasonality of your category and you can deseasonalize based you can basically divide for example if you have you are selling 100 per month and you are in the month of April you can divide this by 120% and you will dealy the the the product if you don't have seity this is okay but this is is also if you want to do it more advanced but I want to keep it simple for most of you so if you didn't get it what I say keep it simple you just want to estimate do estimate the the way it works but sometimes if you if you do a promotion in winter or summer and you are you are selling ice cream that won't be the same average uh the average wiard promotion you could do that or you could also consider that because what we want to calculate is the quantity change so what is the quantity Sol is the average you could do the average total or the average per month for example if you were in April you could say my normal in April is not 90 but it's 120 so I will consider I will compare 95 versus 120 okay so that was just for the one who wants to go deeper but let's keep it simple with this one there is no let's say there is no seasonality so quantity change we just divide quantity Sol by the average quantity without promotions okay so we have plus 2% plus 2% and for this one we have plus 22% okay plus 22 means that when my price is going down by 30% I increase my quantity by 20% 22% and the the months after you can do the the same calculation per week per week if you have promotion for more than one week you can Group by weeks you could do what is the volume for two weeks during and after whatever the gr you like there is no this is the same principle okay so you can see that plus 22 and then minus 3% and then it's interesting for the other promotion this time with the same promotion we did plus 17 and and then minus 3% this one 40% less plus 32 not too bad this one plus 20 we raise the price and we we lost 19% and this one minus 20 plus 12% okay so what do we have now the the formula of elasticity is very simple you're going to divide the price change divided by the quantity change what did I did I think it's the opposite is the quantity change my apolog by this nice quantity change by price change okay minus 73% what does it mean that let's say if I re like I'm going to 73% of my reduction will be will be rais into quantity okay when I go to this one it's easier to understand this one it's almost let's say it's 50% when I reduce my price by 30% I increase my volume by 15 so 50% of my reduction will be reporting into quantity sold okay so that's my lity less than one we consider that there is not a very strong more than one there is a very minus one or plus one is a very strong elasticity uh but this is interesting in this specific case okay so now you have the elasticity you can just do the same formula and I'm going to do the same actually it's not really elastic one is more the what is the after effect after the the promotion and for that I'm going to divide the quantity change by the price change the week or the month before okay so I'm going to do and this one is very important because most of the company they forget about this one so when you see when you have a big um pick like this then you a drop so you need to correct during the promotion up and then after the promotion down sometimes it's for more than one week or one months so you have to be careful look at the data and sometimes more than that so now you have this during and after and what is the total elasticity we're going to talk about it there is a question if your elasticity is linear or not let's keep it simple but I'm going to give you my recommendation uh when you have multiple elasticity like this just do the average okay so you do the average you do like this average this and you all control control t t t maybe not the positive one let's remove the this one let's only use the one going when we reduce the price not one we don't increase and we have minus 67% in average and I did the same for the the after effect and the after effect is 14% okay so now I say okay the elasticity of this product or it could be a category you could do the same effect with the full subcategory or category uh at the end I think the more you have data the more it's relevant and if it's a very low sell product you won't have maybe enough information so try or do it with different P but you can also sum if they have the same price that's a challenge but you can also focus on average price that that could be another another solution for that so now let's say Okay Edward I want to do a promotion my marketing wants to do minus 10% great what will be the quantity change so the quantity change is very simple you're going to say okay I'm going to apply you have two options or you apply the elasticity of the similar promotion before and if you have two similar you can do the average for example of this two the average of this two- 30% is - 65 or you do my overall parameters and that's what I'm going to use for this one because I don't have any promotion in the past with minus 10% so what we're going to do next I'm going to do this equal to 67 and then if I want to get my my reduction I'm going to do price change my price change isus 10% times 67 I have plus 7% and then in my formula I'm going to add okay my Baseline is 98 or maybe 100 I'm going to keep 98 plus 7% so now my new forecast is 105 and the months after we're going to do the same elasticity like the the after effect and we're going to do 14% times 14% * 10 - 10% we have - 1% so at the end uh we we have we don't have price change but the quantity will go down by two quantity so we go from 105 to 97 okay so that that's a way to calculate elasticity that's a very a very very simple introduction I want to keep it too complex because I think that's a very very good start you have to standardize your impact and having a an an average elasticity by category or even just one at the beginning would be much better than a lot of people that just you know try to use the intuition and most of the time the intuition is not that efficient in the next episode I'm going to give you another method to calculate elasticity using the linear the linear regression
in this episode we're going to talk about another solution this is not mandatory so if you don't like if you think it's too much you can just keep this video and accelerate and if you curious we're going to talk about it so we had a question about okay let's all let's look all this promotion and let's look the what is the the trend like the kind of the linear trend for all this promotion to see if we have a linear or nonlinear elasticity of that so how do we do that we're going to do we're going to get all the price the different price that we have so we have 30 and we have what as the quantity equal to 130 so we just do this table and you try to to regroup you can also do pivot table with average sales if you have a lot of data but you can regroup all of this 35 so in this one I I did an average of because we have two discount with 35 so I did average of 120 and 115 and I did the same for this this and this at the end I have all my data point with different price and the average quantity per month for that okay and the question is okay but if I want to to sell 70 or I want to sell for exle $38 what will be my quantity forecast right that's a very good question and for that we're going to use another method so we're going to create a shot of this like this insert so this is my quantity so and we're going to change the axis can't see much okay D okay so now we have no now is the price up come on doesn't want okay doesn't want now we have the shart and we can see that we have a pretty linear Trend between the price you have the price and the quantity sold if you do right click at a trend line let's change the color you can see that it's very linear I know what can do is like you know what okay I want you have this line and you can follow this line with a formula and you say okay if I sell to 45 that will be the data point this data point will be this specific one if I want to 52 I will go to this specific one so what we have to do is okay I'm in 52 the result is I don't know 90 90 quantity and that's what we're going to do now you can use the formula from the linear regation but sometime I don't know I triy this equation and it doesn't work so we can we're going to use it what we did in uh the when we were comparing different model with one product there is a Formula called slope and intercept and the slope is very simple it's going to give you basically the formula a X plus b for linear regression I know this is mathematics but I want to talk about it just for your curiosity if you curious otherwise you can skip that and just to keep in mind the slope will give you the first parameter so the SL you select first the quantity and then the price you have this minus 1.55 and then The Intercept same selection price and quantity and you have this formula and then if you want to have for example for 70 what will be the the point that we want so 70 will be like this clack clack what you're going to do you're going to do 70 times slop plus intercept so the quantity for $70 will be 66 if I go to say okay now I want 52 52 I will be here I will be 94 which makes sense as well so that's a good way to o no not this one 55 89 okay if I go to let's go 10 very cheap 159 so that's a linear what we call linear regression now let's say that it's more advanced but I just want to show you let's say that if you really go very cheap if I go to for example if my data point was here quantity 200 there will be something like this you say oh maybe this is not a linear regression right so I'm going to go back to the file trend line maybe this is a polom and you say oh maybe this one is better we will call polinomial is more than uh like it's more advanced you see the this one can change so you could do like this or you can even do a polom with three orders so this is more complex to apply this kind of formula you can display on the chat sometimes it doesn't work well the formula doesn't work but just for your curiosity display the equation on the chart and you say okay no I could apply this formula and the x is the price okay so try to apply this formula the formula if you are curious to be honest if you go to this direction I will use more like python or machine learning but I just wanted to show you that this is the curve and know you need you can also apply this formula to say okay if I'm in 55 that will be a different price so you could apply this a similar formula for polinomial or exponential or logarithmic but I just wanted to give you an introduction to be honest let's keep it simple with linear for most of you you can keep it linear or you can just have correspondence table like I I said before you can for this specific price I'm going to set this specific quantity or I will have this specific elasticity and now after talking about that we're going to start to standardize the format for your sales and marketing team
so you did this work of elasticity price analysis with most of your products and category that you really want to promote in the future the more you will analyze and spend time and really like try to identify what are the the elasticity the more you will be able to to have a quality uh of fusing for this specific promotion but I think the most important of that most important of that is to make sure that you make it very standard so what I'm what I'm going to say with stand is like the more you you have different options for promotion the more it's very difficult to to promote and to also to forecast so I would Rec really recommend to create this format and this template is gold I can tell you if you use my template in your company will be probably much much better than anything they have and you're going to love it and it's very simple and you can keep it very simple at the beginning and then try to optimize step by step so what I like to do what I did in my PR Company before becoming director is to standardize the the type of first the step of price discount okay you say okay I have a price and I'm going to Define what is my elasticity plus plus Z is the current month and the month after or what is the you can also call it the the after effect okay so I use 67 but you could have a specific category by like a specific elasticity Sorry by category or subcategory okay so you would be a bigger matrice but at the end you could add like category one category two Category 2 etc etc okay so you have this you have the price of elasticity and you're going to say okay now if I do minus 10% I'm going to do use this times this F4 so I'm going to give you automatically what is the impact on the first month and on the second month this 14% is equal to this value okay so I I will get an automatic selection base on my price so we're going to do that after we say okay if I my price change by 20% my impact is plus 30% in in terms of quantity we're going to talk about it later then it's not only about the price it's also about the exposure type what kind of exposition do you have for the promotion so this is just few examples but you should really list all the example and really spend time with marketing and sales to see what are the different ones and you probably have way too many you should that's why you should first write down all of them and then have a meeting and simplify but let's say if you have a and you should try to estimate in addition to the elasticity of for example a normal discount okay when have a solo discount my impact is 100% I have no change in my impact okay I use 100% of my change but if I have a discount not only for one produ but for the full subcategory for example of my electricity bike I won't sell that much one single item I will send overall all of them so maybe my ire will be divided by two I say I will say most of everything more but not as much if it was only one item so I will probably reduce if it was the full category if I was like the same discount not only for electricity bik but for all the bikes of me for all the closing there will be even less impact for one specific product but now if I'm going to put my product on the first page of my website I'm going to increase my Exposition so my impa will be 200 100% so 100% more uh with the same price discount if I send I put my produ into my newsletter many people will read this email for example when I launch a new course I send you an email so I have more visibility so I'm going to sell more of my new course than my previous course if I don't expose them and for example if you do ads ads on Instagram that could be also a different impa you could also include where is the duration of the exposition is it one week two weeks three weeks that would be more complex but it's just to give you one specific example okay so you will have an impact based on the Expos show type and then something also very important you could be for example you have a discount just for Walmart or for all your Cent sence that won't be the same impact for the total forecast quantity of your one product if you for if you have only a promotion to Walmart you need to defy what is the weight of Walmart on your total quantity model so usually you don't do that by by product you do that by subcategory so I recommend you to do a client like weight analysis to say okay Walmart represent for my buy category of overall 30% of my quantity sold for this specific category okay so it's going to be 30% so if I do if my total impact is plus 20% but I'm only doing for Walmart which represents 30% I'm going to do 20 * 30% so my real impact is not 30% oh it's not sorry 20 it's 6% because Walmart is only 30% and if this is a category for example it's a subcategory this conso it's more than one one product my real impact is only 3% because on on my on specific product okay because we are L we have less exposure on the product and it's only one client so this analysis of the impact for clients is also very important you could also impact the the the after effect if you want but I want to keep it simple and also don't put all your clients if you have for example 1,000 client just put maybe the top five or top top 10 maximum and then you do other category to be honest if you have like very small client that represent 5% of your sales and you do plus 20% and 5% of your sales is going to be 1% or less on the total impact so you don't really care and when I was forecasting for supermarket and a lot of small pharmacies were selling my cosmetics and I was never really taking this into account because it was too too weak okay same when you when you don't know how to calculate the impact of all your clients maybe just take the biggest one and just do the the math to to complete but at the end it's very important to estimate if this is a promotion for all your clients or specific ones and Pate with the weight of all of them okay so now when you have that this is great what we're going to do next we're going to create this like template that you're going to provide to your marketing and sales team and for yourself that will really help you to automate the way you you get the impact of your promotions and how to implement it into your forecast Excel file or Erp
okay so now we have all the impact and we standardize the the kind of promotion and Exposition and clients the next step is to create a template that your team is going to love okay so for example let's say you want to create a promotion and you going to say to your team hey guys marketing I know you don't have much time but just use this Excel file and send me the the promotion don't send by email don't do blah blah blah just follow this template okay and you say okay I have a new promotion it's a for examp example it's a road bike road bike road bike men we're going to do minus 30% it's uh we're going to do Instagram because we are crazy but we're going to only sell to Amazon so the impact at the end and we're going to start April 24 for example so the impact on the forecast on the the Baseline forecast will be plus 10% in April and in um the months after minus 2% boom you see it's very simple and very also pedagogic for your team to say oh cuz sometimes you say you know what I'm going to do this promotion for my B2B business and the price change will be 10% you say okay only 2% impact should I really do that or not so that's what I really recommend you to do and how to do that you need to create like you have this and then you can also do like category um subcategory promotion if you want and then you I will teach you how to change that in your file but what you can do is like list validation so if you go to data data validation sorry you go to list and then I really recommend you to don't give room for mistakes okay so you you make them select they cannot write down for example Rod uh no you cannot okay you have to make sure it's standardized same for subcategory same for price change I just selected from this spe specific one same for exposure type you can see like up and same for client okay if you want to update for example you want to dat oh I want to do I don't know TV TV ads wow that would be crazy tv ads 500% it's National TV oh and we conate one week will be good to say TV has one week great you can just update this one you cannot see it so you can just do like this thata and you res select nice oh no not nice up nice and now you say you know what I'm going I'm crazy we're going to go tv ads just for B2B which is stupid there is no impact uh tv ads B2B what happen exposure type ah I select the wrong one sorry I'm getting tired recording can be exhausting that was a good one okay so no TV ads one week one so now we have this impact B2B no B2B doesn't make sense Walmart for example only in M minus 10% on this bike or minus 20% boom that will be the impact okay and how to do the calculation of this it's very simple you don't have to do this you can do a three vup in the formula but basically it's just vup of this and this table then I do the same video cap with this table then I do the same video cap of clients and this table okay so it's very simple and then you can or you can add the three v c i just multiply this times this time this okay and I have my total impact or you can do a v indir vs time v v in the same formula then you don't need that but sometimes you know what you say you know what I want to change the the impact for because I think it's too much or you can change manually if you want but don't leave too too much room to uh to change for marketing and sales they don't have much time they don't have really good to to analyze data most of the time maybe you are part of the sales team and I welcome you but they most of the time they don't have time for that so keep it simple I know you have this super calculator for the impact and also for the after effect and the after effect will be T tck you're going to we're going to multiply this this and the 14% where is the 14% M plus one so we're going to multiply this time the elasticity of the after effect so m+ one you have the M plus 0 and m+1 that you can see and that's what we're going to see for the after effect of the M plus1 okay so that's it for the the super calculator and now in the next episode okay great for example we're going to take the last two okay you want to do a first web page website minus 50% at Walmart plus 20 and minus 4% how you going to do it in Excel that's what we're going to do now
okay so now we do have this impact we want to for example change the forus of the electric city bike and we're going to do it into this Excel file maybe you don't have an Excel you have an Erp and you can use this template my friend Mario was doing something very similar to update your your forecast directly in percentage or in value okay so if you go back to my file you can go back to the original file with the base we have this file and keep in mind we had this for for this forecast can be very complex why because at the end I'm going to override the forecast so you can now you can if you have maybe if your computer is too slow if you have too much information you can delete this forecast and you can hide and now we're going to change quantity we're going to overwrite and that's what we're going to do for example let's say if I want to change the months of September I say oh I want to 200 boom it's going to change here okay so that's that's the purpose of this formula but the first question is when you overwrite do you want to change in percentage do you want to just in like do incremental quantity for example how I want to increase my focus by 20 units or do you want to override completely and that's a very good question you have the two the three are possible but I recommend to override completely why because if do in percentage for example if you do this times 1.5 or plus 50% oops Yeah I cannot really do it because uh this one is a I have a circular reference for this specific one but if I wanted to do that like 1.5 times and it was connected each other time 78 the thing is like I've done that in the past and sometimes you have your for example let's say you have a massive forecast you want to raise your your volume by 50% but the promotion happened one week before so your average sale will will go up but because you have a percentage you're going to increase and increase again like automatically something this forecast is moving every every week or every month that you update so it's pry risky to add a percentage or even a quantity like an additional quantity because it's going to change a formula which is evolving alone and for example let's say you have a massive sales if you have a massive sales you're going to change the average sales and you're going to add an an extra 20 30 40 50% so to be honest if you manage a lot of products I will be very careful with the percentage of change I will override the forecast I will not like do something too uh to be honest uh with too much variability because you won't be able to track all of this every week or every month so I will not add percentage I will not add incremental some software using incremental or I want to increase the Basel line by 20 but the thing 20 it depends like is it 10% of your Bas line but if your basine double you you are not going to double this Baseline as well so I will really do the the calculation from scratch and I will completely override the value instead of adding percentage or uh incremental value okay so now what we're going to do uh we're going to talk about in The Next Episode how to change what is the formula to do this automatically because if you do it manually if you do for example i1 190 you're going to kill the forecast and you're going to break your file and it's going to be a mess so in the next episode I'm going to teach you how to do that in Excel
so in this episode I'm going to tell you how to override in Excel with all this formula this is an advanced topic if you're not comfortable with Excel it's okay you can just go you find your own way I'm just showing one way but you have multiple way to do it but I feel it's important also to do because it looks scary but it's not that that complex when you get it so the first thing you have to understand is like don't break the formula if you want to do for example 100 quantity then you will lose the formula and when I'm going to update the file nothing will happen so for example if I go back to level I'm going to fake that we in the two months before you go back to level and you do like this select seven and eight no select all I know we are in the month of June when you do that all the file is up to date now you see before was two months after now it's June before it was August and you see you still have the formula you still have 100 so it's going to be is not going to be great if you do that so that's the first important thing don't overwrite the forecast with you need to have an extra like that's why I have another colum then I first I can visualize the change and also I'm not breaking my formula you're going to forget about it for sure the second one is there is this formula that say like okay we're going to go back to it I'm going to get okay if I'm in the August I want to focus with the same I want to find the same month okay okay if I do 100 I'm going to change this month if I'm in September 200 I'm going to change this month and if I'm in November 50 I'm going to change this oneth so you need to find the same correspondent between this column and this column the problem is this one are moving automatically every single month so you had 8 9 10 and before when I was selecting I'm going to do it again to make sure you get it so now we're in August let's say you update the file not it should be September but I only have data in September up now you have six so you have 6 7 8 9 that's the next month and this one are still 8 9 10 11 12 why they're not moving but you see my forus moved before the 100 was here now it moved here so we move automatically and the thing is if you don't if you have an automatic formula for this month you're going to you're going to move the forecast to the wrong months so it's a bit complex to understand maybe for you but at the end you have to be careful this is dynamic but this is static because you don't want to do every month oh I moved by one month so I need to do this okay I need to switch I need to um to shift all my forecast so that's why I wanted to talk to you first is to make sure that so this one is equal to the the current months you have a formula above I explained that before and this one is static you could do do it like this or you could just say you know what because every month you can move this one or you could always have the next 12 months fix control like this contrl x okay you could always have the next like 12 months like this but be careful if you want to have July for example right now we are in um in June if you want to override July you need to update this specific month July is this one 500 okay and when you do 500 you are going to update this one so very important this colum has to remain Statics when you have right otherwise you're going to lose all the change going to contrl Z T tac tac I've been recording a lot so okay so you need to have this static but then the problem is if you change you have 6 S8 you cannot just do an equal formula here like you cannot just check here so you need to find a way to say okay let me compare the eight with the eight okay the same months and how to do that there is a Formula I'm using you can use multiple way but we're going to go we're going to go step by step first we're going to go back to the initial formula the initial formula was you can do like do it with me if you want to practice with Excel average demand corrected by like avability and old layers Etc plus the trend plus the seasonality not time not times times the seasonality times the trend so this is my forecast okay then I have all of this just to say you know what if this is empty keep your formula if this is if there's a value just use the value that's it but you have a long formula why because it's a bit more complex you need to find the right column and the right row so we're going to do like this this is my formula I'm using an hooker but you could also use an index and match if you follow my Excel course Excel expert you can also learn how to use it or you can just Google it if you just want to know that but I use this one because it's quite easy to use and what is this formula I'm going to do it again I'm going to use what we call the edge lookup so the edge lookup will look for I'm going to do it here H look up with 20 o what is the lookup value I'm looking for the month of August right what is my table I want to look in this table don't select the column because this is not the first row so be careful this is row number eight you can go down like this down down down you can select this and if you want you can increase more rows because if you have more products you don't have to change the formula then you will ask me what is the row index so the row index is going to find automatically that the opposite of you is going to okay which row do you want to find the number and the row is like I want the first product okay so the first product is row number 1 2 3 4 so I want four is the opposite of you but vertical and then zero okay okay cool now I have I have my 200 but the problem is if I go like I'm going to lock down my formula F4 F4 and the row now when I do that the problem is ah but now I want to go down automatically still keeping the row number four is still keeping this one so we need to find a way to have an automatic number four and how to do that I do not recommend to add a like a row number on the left because if you change the order of your product is going to mess up all of it so what I will do I will use the formula called match and the the formula match is very simple you're going to match just you're going to go to this col and just check what is the row number okay so I'm going to do a match formula here match I always recommend to decompose the formula and then try piece by piece and then just assemble the puzzle so what is the lookup value the lookup value is my code and what is the lookup array is from row number eight to be careful make sure you have the same selection so 920 row and zero I think exact MH nice so now I have the row number four and I need to change F4 F4 and you can see now F four 5 6 7 8 perfect so now we're getting better and now you just have to assemble the puzzle match you go back to this formula you do like this nice and if I try for example this one I'm going to do 56 is going to change this one and know the last step is what you copy all of it you go back to the first formula and you say if so this is my formula automatic if paste if this is different of blank then you can equal blank or you can whatever you prefer you're going to copy if this is not blank then you get the value otherwise use my automatic formula and you close the bracket and now we went back to the same formula before it looks very compl because I copy and paste twice the H lookup you can also use the index match solution you can use the one you prefer but it was just a way to do it maybe you already have an Erp and it's okay for you um whatever the solution you use though when you have this you just copy like this and now we have the automatic formula automatically and now you can see my override let's see 50 like this and when I'm going to update my file okay I'm moving to the latest months boom every know we in no and you can see that now my change move to T tac tac [Music] let me check this I forgot to lock a formula doesn't work okay so I forgot to move this one so I need to yes I had to I had to look this one I think now it's better was good to try okay so now we can see that the CH are correct and the months of November as well and if I do this one 9999 boom I have this one as well okay so my formula is working and now if I go back to the example I want to do just to conclude what was it was the the electric city bike 90118 my plus 20 minus 4% so how to update this one very simple as the second one in what was the date in April oops no in March so I go to March and I do equal so what is what was the value Mar 58 so I will do equ Al 50s time 1.2 and the other one will be it's going to be minus 4% so equal what is the 58 three 65 times 0.96 so that's an except and then don't forget to add maybe your comments it's always good to explain it's it's okay if you don't have a full number and the next step will be to add had a comment on what's happening in your D and for that I created an automatic standardize your comments so I did a concatenation of all this information that you can see and then you can say minus 20% TV at one week one M 0424 which pretty which is pretty cool so you can just copy and paste value like this copy go back to your file try to standardize everything you can even the comments okay and just add comment like this you can add it also here if you want all it's a text format so you can add a bracket like this oops uh whatever and you can also copy the commment if you have multiple cell past special commments so now you're ready boom we have the information we have the common we have everything we need and in the next episode we're going to focus this time the promotion of a full subcategory
okay so now in this episode we're going to talk about how to forecast a full category discount for example you have the subcategory accessories folder minus 70% they really want to push this category discount everywhere all and the impact is May minus no plus 24% and minus 5% so how we're going to do that very simple now we have everything we need we're going to select the folder category Perfecto and now what we're going to do we going to we're going to make sure they are we're going to sort A to Z no we're going to first very important it's good I did the mistake make sure they're all just do an A to Z first then you don't have like blank or rows between your selection then you select your phone holder then you see you have you don't have any rows in between the three 36 37 38 perfect and now what we want to do we want to so it's May and June 24 what will be the forecast so May and June will be this one so what you can do you can copy the code you can use the same file or you can uh yeah you can do like this but don't forget to change after you have all your code you go back then you do May and June so you take forecast like this this is all number okay and uh this you can do it in another spreadsheet if you want no five six and know what is the new forecast you do this times 1 + 24 F4 so this is your new forecast for this specific Ms and then the after effect is this times 1 +-4 so basically that's the forast you need for your products you can do it like this or directly in your file but yeah at the end you just need to copy one make sure you have the same order and then you go back to your file contrl C five and six make sure you have the same column five and six right click paste value boom nice so now you have your forast and you can see that now your forast switch from uh select data your focus switch from this to this you have the it was very it was a flat seasonality I move from up and down for all your category which is pretty cool right so now you have this which is great and don't forget to add the comment standardize the comment I'm going to repeat that many times because most of the time what is it talking about what is this promotion again so you can do like this can put it in all your like this and you can also new commment okay and past the comment and not so now you have all of it which is pretty cool so this is a good way to do it what will be also good is to save all this command and information or you can the best way also is maybe just to save this file you know with the also you can also include the date of change uh when did you include who was responsible as well for the the promotion also to include the responsibility will be something great but at the end yeah I just wanted to to show you all the the potential of making as standards as possible and I'm I'm pretty sure you don't have something like this in your company you can start in Excel then you can try to implement in your software it can be very complex to have this kind of solution in the software even my friend Amazon was using Excel at the beginning uh but yeah I hope this is useful for you have a look update make it your own um tool and also really start simple don't try to estimate all the impacts of all the categories start with the biggest promotion of the year and uh just do this example and use this kind of tool to also educate the different impact and you can also approve this different impact with your sales marketing and finance to see what is the best solution to make it it more efficient for you
okay so now in this episode I'm going to talk about how to simplify and reduce your promotion and I WR I I wrote an article on LinkedIn 3 years ago about why this specific brand don't need Black Friday you can check my profile if you want but the first question we have to to ask is why do we need promotion we need promotion most of the time to stimulate the demand because we are not selling enough we we can also use it to increase the brand awareness it could be also a merchandizing strategy uh it could be also most of the time as well to liquidate Too Much inventory and also to educate customer but educate customers in the bad way because if you wait too much if you give too many promotions they going to wait for the next one so you're going to always have to do to do promotions to sell and this is an addiction that this specific brand don't rely on if you know Ika Deaton Louis or apple of course they do promotion but they you know like if you want to buy the new iPhone will you will never have a promotion you can only get a promotion from Apple once the new one is released right but you don't you never have promotion for the new one same foron e eeka if you know EA they always have their strategies every day low price like the catl I work for this company for a very long time and yes they do promotions when they have too much inventory to clean the inventory they do few fake promotion like yes they do some promotion for like uh Christmas or Black Friday but this one are very profitable they're not like relying on this promotion it's just to play the game but when you want to buy go to E you don't wait for the next Black Friday or you don't wait for the next like sales period to go to go to IA or Louis vuon or apple you just go now because you are not used to get uh promotion and you know that you would have you find the better price every single day especially for the first two so this is also very important and as a leader as a manager you should question this strategy because most of the time this strategy of doing too many promotions are shortterm they're not well executed and they are not profitable on the long run because your your your brand is getting weaker and weaker every uh single year if you look at for example Best Buy the business model of Best Buy was lot of promotions very aggressive and at the end they were struggling compared to Apple for example or Samsung where they Brands and all strategy to do that so weak brands does rely on promotions strong brand don't rely on promotion okay and uh at the end the conclusion of all this is try to simplify your promotion planning you probably have way too many promotions different promotions too many times a year and it's a nightmare and for me it was a nightmare and at one point I was strong enough I was supply chain director and I could say you know what first I was showing the numbers I was say you know what we're going to going to stop we're going to instead of doing four promotions a month we're going to do only one or even less and the recommendation is try to do something more like to concentrate more energy on less promotion event and you're going to do it much more efficient okay so you will have much more stability you won't create noise for your automatic forecast for your seasonality and it's going to be much much more efficient for everyone sometimes marketing needs to justify what their job so they do way too many activities sometimes you have pressure on the shortterm with sales because they have to promote way too fast because they need to make their bonus but at the end you need to stay strong and you need to have a mid and long-term strategy if you want to protect the sustainability of your business when I was on the stock market on this fragrance business and cosmetic I had a lot of pressure and they asked me to promote my um my fragrance my very like Hugo Boss fragrance very luxury one and I did we did like 40% off of course we did an amazing pick but then for three months we didn't sell anything and it was a nightmare because our customer were waiting for the next promotion and we had a lot of pressure because we are not selling enough and we we didn't make a lot of profit we met Revenue but not profit so don't get into this game it can be very toxic and very stressful and the goal is to simplify reduce simplify redu and also focus more energy on that because if you have more attention you you will have a better execution on that so keep it this into into mind and try really to reduce first to analyze how many what kind of promotions do you have how many what kind of exposure type just show the reality and sometime you say guys we have way too many options we're going to divide by two or even just by 10% to make it more efficient so try to follow this uh this Jour and I'm sure you're going to do great and I see you to talk about how to manage new product f
all right Mario so now let's talk about how you deal with promotions with deals H we got we on the on the page and you have you have millions of promotions every every month even maybe every day um so tell me more about what of course you have machine learning but first of all how do you get the information from your key account team how do you get the information because you you are the one who Define a new process to get this information well tell me how does it work like for example this airpod we have 24% off this is the deal yeah sure so uh ideally you have to put the the promotion information in in in the system okay there as early as possible okay ideally ideally those things um should have done should have been done at the at the beginning of the year when you're negotiating all the economic terms with your vendors okay um because because it's it's it's it's a big budget for the vendors and and it has to be negotiated together with other stuff okay uh maybe other type of conditions other economical condition Financial condition even supply chain related conditions and stuff so ideally then of course you can change it later on but ideally the Big Buck of it should be negotiated there okay not to have surprise later on and so the the supply the supply chain can run smoothly okay but you know if you cannot do it then you know the earliest possible you know early as possible um yeah what what kind of uh information um you should put in um um I mean of course the most important is the discount price how big is the discount okay how big is the discount then how long is is going to run a promotion is going to be like five weeks uh five days uh one day uh 12 hours whatever um uh especially on internet we have things like coupons maybe limited coupons uh you can have a promotion that runs only for um a limited number of items like only to the first 1,000 items sold or things all timed promotion only for six hours or you know whatever you can have stuff like this is very very important and ultimately what is most important of all is the visibility of the promotion so sometimes is related to the type of promotion because certain type of promotion have certain visibility okay uh but it cannot be for example let's say you're running it's a kind of promotion where you're running a banner on the homepage of Amazon I mean it's going to be massive okay the in is going to be super big okay if it is if it is just a discount and not even advertising in in the promotion page you know very although although the discount might be high hidden somewhere nobody's going to see it so the visibility is very very important also just to go back to this because uh people always think about the price but it's all about visibility and not only for Ecommerce in retail as well or even for manufacturing company if you don't tell to your customer hey guys my raw material is going down by 25% no one knows you want affect anything so I think the exposure or the communication around the promotion is more important than the price itself and it's very important to standardize the way you Expose and what what is the impact of different way and you say even on on TV it's not the same you are mention oh the product is on TV but what does it mean right yes exact so TV it's what channel what time you know what uh if it is in a specific uh uh TV show like what TV show how long he's going to stay there like 5 seconds or he going to make an appearance for 1 hour especially really for books you know media items are often advertising during TV shows or or or nowadays influencer okay how many influencer I mean how many influencer You Know What's the total followers of those influencers you know uh uh and you know you can you have to be extremely analytical otherwise otherwise you're gonna make uh uh you know your best guess and and it probably is not going to be very accurate um yeah yeah it's I think just to give you my example because I did a lot of promotion the problem of promotion is the the execution before and the lack of standardization and I think most of the company they should reduce their number of promotion but to to to improve the execution first and the process and that's what you did you told me you create an Excel to get input from your ke account right yeah so the the so this was this was basically a big model okay uh basically adopted for for overall Europe so there were like hundreds of account managers um yeah so basically I was pulling out the data from the system okay about the promotions yeah and uh I was basically suggesting to each account manager what were the items where it should have a deep look okay because things didn't didn't it didn't seem that the machine was taking the promotion rightly into account okay so or or or he might have actually uh he he had to improve the terms of his promotion for example okay things like this okay so a higher discount or you know whatever change the type of promotion sometimes it's it's related like the type of promotion goes with the with a discount and uh yeah so far so on and for example let's take back go back to the airport Pro okay we do 24% how do you do the ls calculation you you have like a mean yeah so the The Mach Le algorithms does a bit of that uh when it but you know you have to also Recon when it doesn't work right so the the best way is always to find a comparable so what you have to find so it's a bit more complicated you don't only have to find a comparable product you have to find a comparable product a comparable product sorry a comparable promotion on a comparable product okay yes because for example let's say you make a five days promotion 30% discount and then this type of promotion okay but it's not the same if you run the promotion during Christmas if you run the promotion during January I don't know okay so you know you have to be very care this subtle change it might it might Mak a gigantic difference okay yeah and I can see the daon is only it's 30% off it's really cheap I need to buy now hurry up hurry up about mine $600 wow it's a good deal I'm going to click now sorry we have to stop the recording uh but more seriously uh okay so you have the comparable though at the end like you are this company's 100 billion multiple hundred billions ofar so it looks very complex when you sell all of this but for a smaller company I will standardize the input I will try also to standardize the way you can promote to simplify everything between Marketing sales and I will compare with comparable and starting to maybe maybe even if it's manually to start learning from this process and the last step will be to track the accuracy of the correction of your promotion so you do that right as well and uh can you tell me more about how you track the accuracy of promotion yes yes and and just to finish on a previous Point yes I think if if you if you're a small company and you cannot deal with too many data yeah the best way yes is standardizing the type of promotion you're running so if you have I don't know three different types of promotion you have to be sure that the criterias are really really really consistent okay so if there is a promotion where you put your items at the entrance of the store or and a specific TV channel with that or or even without specifying if it's TV or influencer whatever that at least 1 million people audience or 10 million people audience you know you have to be very very standards very very Analytical in your types of promotion and if the promotion doesn't satisfy the criteria it doesn't get to be that type okay it's something else so you can encode all this complex information it's just the type and be standardized and be very very strict with your uh uh um U standard it has to meet all these criteria to get that kind of promotion okay I think it's it's easier for smaller companies yeah I think yeah I think that I think that was a good conclusion and if you go back to uh measuring yeah yeah so you you then then um you know you have to measure the accuracy of of the of the forecast you know during the promotion period especially when you have I during Pro for promotions in general I would say it's a very uh complex topic okay it's very difficult to forecast for promotion almost as difficult as forecasting for new products almost okay um and you have yeah you have to you have to track the accur in generally for promotion but also especially when you have specific events big events you know in generally it's like one every two months more or less okay um um of the accuracy of your system forecast the forecast generated by the machines the argm the formula whatever the Exel uh and the uh uh override okay the override the Gap the estimate that was given by the the let's say the the salesperson or the anyway the planner the person responsible of the for okay so that with this information you use it to basically uh uh throttle I mean at least we did use it to throttle how much this specific person can intervene in the future in relation to Promotions okay so you might maybe it's not very accurate in promotions okay so it's we better leave the machine as it is so next time you cannot uh change the forecast for promotions but maybe you can still change the forecast for launching new products because is pretty much accurate over there and it creates a lot of value we're going to talk about it the forecasting review but it was good to to tease on it's very Advanced but I think it's very inspiring as well so thank you for that Mario I have to leave you because I need to buy my new daon and I see you for another episode
in this chapter we're going to talk about how to forast new products and I can tell you it's not as easy as the Baseline because we have a lck of historical data we we don't know this product maybe we're going to launch a new flame bike there there is no data history there is a lot of uncertainty maybe you have very long lead time so you need to focus maybe one year in advance you have also the impact on the current products maybe you will have some canalization maybe the marketing will do an amazing job is going to be very visible maybe it's just going to be another product around 15,000 in a retail in a retail store you also have the pricing challenge because you never sold before what would be the right price to fit the market demand you can have also many supply chain issues and capacity because you don't know in advance and you will have to react the data quality and the avability of the products also will will will determine the trend of the product and many people do forecasting uh of new products with a lot of experience and intuition it's not easy to qualify and to be methodical with intuition and I can tell you most of the time there were a poor coordination between Department between marketing who wants to be very big very fast or the the product manager and supply chain like me or the product or the for example the production or Logistics that need to have plan in advance to make sure that we can supply the demand so most of the time there is a lack of time there is a lack of method and there is also a lack of focus and of course also there is the lack of review before and just after the launch so we're going to talk about it in this chapter and the real question is is it possible to forast accurately and new products that's a real question had so many times is it possible and I can tell you it really depends on the type of the product first here for example we're going to talk about Al to forecast variation let's say we had the blue mod bike before now we have a red one this one would be much easier to forecast than this one that was never on the market before and they want to reshape the industry it's like the new iPhone the First new iPhone right and there is also a question of typology is it like a permanent prod that's going to stay for the next 3 years or is it a new collection that's going to stay only for the next 3 months and you need to be very accurate only for a few weeks or few months only so what I'm going to do first I'm going to teach you how to product new varation similar products for permanent collection and then we're going to forecast new innov is going to be a bit more complex but that's what we're going to see in the next episode
in this episode I'm going to tell you how to forast similar products I have 19 steps it's going to be a quite long video but I feel it was important to have all the steps first I'm going to go a bit fast but then we're going to go back to Excel and I'm going to tell you how to build your own template to build your forecasting of the new products so the first step is to identify what what kind of product is it is it like similar product like permanent we're going to forecast a new Red Mountain Bike versus that's the new version of it and last year was the Blue Mountain back so very similar one and we're going to focus on what are like the collection products that was the last summer collection the blue one and now we're going to forecast a pink version of it okay it's very like I'm going to do like a retail fmcg product but you can also do it for manufacturing it's going to be the exact same principle so the first step is to plan her to have a planning and most of the time we don't have a clear planning and we tend to underestimate all the lead time from the IDS the design and the marketing the snop review all to review all the information together to make sure we are on the same page then the factory and Supply review how much time do we need to confirm is like purchasing procurement capacity production is it possible even to make the product before the lead time of the supplier and you can have up to 10 months 12 months probably for iPhone they take two or 3 years to really plan herad with all the capacity and make sure you have all the steps before me it may be the specific all the stakeholder of your new product launch and make sure that this planning is clear and visible with some safety lead time to make sure that if you have one week late is not too late for that and most of the time you don't have a clear a clear picture what who are the the the people responsible then you need to standardize and centralize the data most of the time in my previous jobs I can tell you it was a mess it was all everyone was using a different Excel template sending different email they were like managing new products by email hey this is the new product with the information by email no standardization there is no like access to all the information no consolidation so at the end you need to standardize and centralize inputs outputs one Excel or maybe you have a software but most of the time most of the company do it in a in an Excel file and it's okay to have a share drive to manage access with make sure that not the wrong people touch the the wrong file and also like having the the clear snop process s not snop but sop like the process and the method to make sure how what is the process for new products and the training for the right people when you have new people coming like in marketing or Finance or whatever they they are all aware if they have an impact or to manage new products we're going to talk about how to standardize with my Excel template just after the number three is to Define responsibilities who is responsible for what who is validating what and if you don't have that clear is going to be quite challenging after for me we go back to the main leader who is the leader of the new products and for me should be the person who knows better the market and the products it could be the product manager it could be for me he was I was responsible for the launch not for all the information of course of the launch but to make sure that I was the facilitator and I was working in suppli ch as for example an snop manager once you have that you need to Define what are the attributes to compare different products for example for this kind of product you could say the type is one attribute okay it's a mountain bike man then the the size it's a large product the style it's a classic style the color is one attribute so this is the attribute type size style color the price of course the season is it all season is it only summer winter and the typology not typology typology for permanent or maybe collection okay this is the first step this is another example for the shirt Woman shirt size medium style logo in the front side pink $40 ser and the typology is collection okay so the more you will Define because to compare products you need to make you need to understand how do you compare them you need to have like an attribute a matrice of attributes that you can really standardize the way you compare products then you need to find this produ so based on this you can okay you're going to check the same category the same color the same size SI okay this looks to seem very similar and this two you have a logo in the front very very similar shape summer shape these are the comparable products we're going to give you I'm going to give you more example after in Excel once you have this comparable products you can also this is not mandatory but collect the what is the trend from the market it could be Market study competitors Trends internet search customer feedback maybe you have a lot of customer asking for new products for me had a lot of members and followers asking me edar you need to launch a a new forecasting course so I was receiving that and I had a waiting list for this course to beess a very long one it could be going to Industry conference for B2B or b2c could be influencers uh you can see oh Paris Hilton is using a pink bike so maybe this is a new trend you for that you should you should really check with people from marketing uh they have a lot of tools and just to give you a few example I'm going to give you that in the bonus section but I like to compare for example Google Trends to see this is the volume of research between blue mountain bike and red monb and we can see that they are very similar in terms of research in Google and Google is very related to how people behave and you can see that where for example if you if you check around it's about 16% more volume for the blue one than the the red one that could be one indication I'm going to go back to this later but I have another one for example this is to to search all many uh like with more details this is a pay tool what are the research per month for specific keywords if you have a b2c market and you can see that the the blue shirt is 2000k per month research on Google for the US market and the pink shot one woman is 700 so from this specific perspective that it looks like there is 66% less volume for pink shirt than blue shirt that's another example once you have all this information from the market and from your company you collect all the attributes with internal data say okay I have the blue one great what can you say you can see what is the monthly average sales or if if possible demand not selles if you have out of stock okay I sell 50 per month so it could be for the total of your business but it could be also if you have a retail I explained that before it could be my average sales is for example one per store per per week I have one 100 store so it's 100 um the total is 100 quantity per week you could because sometimes you say you know what for the new products I want have 100 customer I will have 50 customers so then you can multiply the average per site times the number of customers in this specific case I'm going to take the total but it's very important if you have a distribution Network and not all of them are taking the products then you can have what is the average price though what is the real price of the product to have this monthly average very important if you do a lot of promotions how many sizes if you have different size won't be the same cell the color and the collection the year of the collection very important for the date and you see okay we have the blue one and we have the black one you sell more it's a bit cheaper but you have two size and it's black and it's permanent it's so it's this one's going to stay for the next few years and then you have the new one collect the attributes you have okay the new price we have inflation so 10% more one side red 2024 okay so get all this information and it's going to be light then you can really compare okay I have the and also include the picture it's good to see the picture of the product and you do the same for the collection say okay I have the the white one I sell much more because it's more basic it's a basic color six size this is the collection I have the blue one and I have the black one you can pause the video but you can see okay this is I think the most similar one the great the the blue one same price same size different color and this is for the next summer okay once you have this you can estimate the Baseline forecast you say okay I'm very close to this one so it's going to be between 50 and and 70 based on what I what what I can see so you can also like include also some marketing action this one's going to be a bit more visible and this is my probability from 50 to 70 uh you have you have a range of uh monthly average for the market if the market is also growing you can add this to to your numbers okay same for the collection okay to Android we could see that the pink is a bit less popular than the blue uh based on my market research from my own company so it's going to be between 70 and 130 per per month okay be careful with the number of size if you have different size and you focus for the full model I'm going to get back to this in Excel then once you have the overall you say okay I'm going to sell 60 per month what is the launch volume versus the normal volume because you could be very different especially if you sell to Distributors they're going to buy a lot the first months and then you will have the drop because they have a lot of inventory that they have to distribute same if you have a marketing plan it could be like you're going to promote a lot the first month and then it's going to drop so try to identify the drop in in Excel the average be like pick and drop you say okay we do plus 50% versus the aage and that's minus 20% we did the same for the promotion uh assessment uh in the previous chapter and you can see oh for textile for fashion it's much more because because it's a small product they're going to buy more at the beginning one box for each size and it's going to be plus 300% and minus 50% after based on your analy if you if you don't know exactly just take your biggest customer such as for example Amazon and Walmart and just do a uh in interpolation after checking with your biggest customers okay then when you have this you say okay great you have you can do your forecast of your launch plus your Baseline so you you include the percentage you say Okay Plus 50% of 60 so 90 and then minus 20% of 60 for the first two months or weeks you can work by weeks or by months whatever your company will you say Okay 90 and then 48+ 50 - 20 and then plus 300 % and minus 50% for this one and you have your first forecast that's a very good start then don't forget there is a seasonality so you need to include the seasonality in this forecast because it depends if you launch in the beginning of the year during summer or winter you won't have the same Baseline right we're talking about it a lot so you're going to get the forast and the seasonality of your category mountain bike and collection and you're going to spread it wasn't before it was 60 and you're going to spread the seasonality coefficient to say okay it's not 60 it's really depends on the we sell much more in June and July then at the end or beginning of the year you could also apply the seasonality for the first two months I'm going to get back to this in the Excel just after so you do the same for all your products and if this is a collection you stop the forecast when the product is not for sale again then we are we're close to the end you need to check with Supply the mq impact where is mq is the minimum order of quantity okay you want to sell 10 but you need to buy 1,000 to launch the production we're going to go back to this in Exel but this is a very important check because why because when you ship products this could be a one carton one pette or even one container and I'm talking a lot of this in my inventory management expert course but you could have a one 100 quantities forecast but your s player say you know what your minimum of production is 500 that means that you have five years of inventory just because of that so you need we're going to check that after so check with the production and supply chain for that then when you have all this information including production and supply chain check and approve with all the stakeholder in the company Finance marketing Logistics product production sales and sometimes the CEO wants to approve the new Innovative product I was part of this Bo of director of product launch review this is very important that everyone is okay that we are ready to go you need to have the confirmation then you need to upload the forecast in your Excel file or in your system we're going to do that later and if you can do it this is much more complex you need to address with cannibalization what is cannibalization is like you know what I'm going to launch a new product and it's going to impact my other product so we say this one is going to be out so no impact but it may affect my my white one and my black one by 5% at the end if you say 5% of 200 is 10 so it's not that much and this one will be 20 20 quantity so overall I'm going to reduce by 30 because people will like to buy the pink and not the the the white one this is more by experiment you should do the same analysis than promotion and we we're going to talk about it later but this don't try to make it too complex uh just try to adjust by experience and based on the previous launcher as well okay then when you have this you have all this information don't forget maybe you did all this work at the beginning but make sure you review The Plan before the launch and most of the time we do all the job 10 months before and then we just forget about it and then we say oh but by the way the cost of prodution is way is way different because we have a big inflation or there is a the marketing is not ready to launch at the same time that the supply so you make sure you have like checkpoint every month or every two months to make sure that there is no surprise at the end then you launch the products don't forget to review very very quickly most of the time after the launch everyone forget about it we leave a forecast in the system that was clear clearly not the reality and we forget and when we react it's too late for example if you talk about the bull whip effect if you have a factory and you supply your consumers you will see a big Peck at the beginning but you don't know if the product is really working and for that you can check my video with the bull whip effect in when we talk about B how to forecast the Baseline the level try to have the information from your real customers and when I was for example selling lipsticks in Supermarket I was sending a big order and then I was paying them to say can I see the real sales in your stores to see like if it's really working because if it's really working I need to already adjust my focus increasing my focus but maybe this product doesn't work at all and if I wait for the next order of my clients it's going to be too late and I will have way too much talk for that so think about also if you are done to the supply chain like from the factory side or distributor try to see what's happening on the real side if your product is working or not and finally when you have um reached all these steps you need to collect as much data as possible and repeat the process from the beginning with all the learning and don't try to reinvent the will really try to consolidate this knowledge try to say okay what was working and not working this launch it can't be all perfect and try to repeat and improve the process each time you have one so I hope you like this 197 it was a quite long episode but I feel that was the overview of what I was doing when I was launching new products and also teaching my clients and now we're going to do it in Excel
okay so now I'm going to teach you how to build a forecasting new product template and I can tell you how wish had this kind of template before in my previous life because it's very efficient very simple and you can bring a lot of values just by bringing this kind of of tool so what is this you can see that we have all the information of new products you can even select the kind of category you have the picture you have all the information you have the yes no with an automatic color which is pretty cool we have all the information I was talking just before that will really help you to to decide if the product is profitable what is the right focus and then we're going to use this focus and copy and paste into the the forecasting exper file okay so what we're going to do first I'm going to teach you how to consolidate this information so you need to get first this is just a very simple table with the item code the item name of the products try to make the item name is very important try to standardize the name that it's easy to find you can have a commercial name but try to have a very clear name that you can use also for your next launch starting with having the right name the number of size that you have could be unique it could be the number of size and later I'm going to tell you how to forecast multiple size of products the category so I'm using this to make sure that because you're going to send this file you're going to stand and send it to marketing to the product manager to supply and make sure that it's as standardized it's better to have a selection and because if if people start writing wrong information it's going to be a mess to consolidate so you can connect this I teach you that before you go to data data validation and you go to list source and you can see there is a list when you just select the categories that you like and also the new one if you have new one coming okay the flying back will come later so I did this for subcategory as well okay Mountain back so if you have a newo you going do you're going to do that the typology permanent or collection who is responsible for the forecast it's very who is the leader of the of the forecast could be the pro product manager it could be maybe lady G galactics she want to take the lead for this new pink collection the margin of the product what is the marging versus the catalog price you could also include all the details of the production cost if you if you want but try to make it visible so maybe you can hide specific column by going to outline and grouping like this or ungrouping then you have all these checkpoint with all the department you can maybe reduce if you don't have that many person the idea is really to have you need to have only green light before presenting a new products you need to have green light from everyone or you can have this green light from the the new products review the meeting that will approve these products from not submitted to to be confirm to be postponed rejected there is no way we're going to do this product or okay for that I'm doing another list if you go to data validation I'm going to list and I'm going you can Define what are the type of like validation that you need it could be on like multiple ones but I like to have at least this one okay you go like this and then you just do the same for all the department you have from product marketing sales Finance supply chain you could have I don't know another department if you feel maybe not HR maybe you could have Logistics if if it's a big big lunch and then when I say Supply is more like the demand the like if we can really Supply so when I say Supply is also the production included but you could separate supply chain and production if necessary and once you have that you can add a conditional formatting I like to have it automatic like this and if you manage my rules I'll just say okay if this is green then equal to okay then no if this is okay then green if this is rejected you go to only sales that contain equal to rejected and you put the the color you like okay so I I teach that before it's good could just to have visualiz oh there is a problem with this one rejected so you can see click or you can even add this kind of filter if you have like for example 100 products you can check okay I have one rejected and I'm going to check what's happening all right once you have this then we're going to go back to probability though you have the the probability of the lo I like to have like just a p number from Z to 100% to see if it's really happening or not it could be based on the the validation before it could also be based on the you know the Bas line r you were giving like we were talking about 50 to 70 it's like yeah these new products we're going to talk about later like there is a very low probability that it's happening because it's a new product but this one is like pretty solid so it could be a 90% so this is not a rocket science number but I like to also add to my like marketing or product manager what is your level of confidence on the probability that this these numbers are real or not okay then you have the size repetition if you have only one product or multiple products I'm going to talk about it later with the different size and then we have all this information that we're going to use like first month level plus 50% and minus 20% and the launch as well I'm going to talk about this in the next video I'm going to teach you how to forecast these products these new products
okay so now we're going to talk about how to forecast these new products keep in mind we had the Baseline range 50 to 70 we have the size of repetition and then at one point we'll have to approve okay what is the okay Bas line what is the one we're going to approve and say okay from 50 to 70 I'm going to use the middle because the probability is high so 60 okay I'm going to put 60 just here 60 nice maybe for this one we're going to talk about it later it could be like you know what 70 230 but there is a the probability is not that high or maybe 70% so I'm going to get closer to 70 than 130 so I'm going to put 90 okay that's that's a beginning and then you're going to you remember we're talking about you have a big Peck the first month because customer buy a lot to fill their their warehouse or you also have maybe more marketing and then the minus 50% is okay it's going to be minus 50% after the the second month after the launch could be per week and this one's going to be minus 20% Then very important you need to have when is the starting month and the ending month September 23 March 25 it's a long long range product this one is only a six month launch it's a collection that's why you can see collection and you could select by the way the typology of this product and then we're going to do the forecast so all are we going to do the forecast we're going to go back to the right and we're going to start with the first pro so I'm going to remove the formula you can see the formula I'm going to say you know what it's pretty simple at the beginning the first month so make sure you putet on the right month we start in September going un Zoom a bit we start in September so great I'm going to do equal and this is my launch 60 times because this is not only 1 plus 50% because I have a big peek at the beginning great so I have quantity then I do the same for the second one I do okay equal I do like this 60 * 1 +- 20 so it's going to be less right 48 so now I have my the beginning of my forecast right and then I'm going to do the next one I'm going to start with the Bas line so I'm going to do you know my b line is 60 do like this t t t t t t t you can lock the formula by pressing F4 enter and then you do this is my forast great congratulation now I've done that we can do the same for this one you maybe pause the video and do it for the this specific collection okay so do it pause the video and try to do the same work before checking all this formula great you've done it right so we're going to do the same we're going to do the Baseline okay times 1 + 50 and then I do the second one and then equal Baseline okay times 1 + - 50% okay so we have the 360 and 45 and then equal I'm going to do equal to my Bas line and you press F4 to lock the formula and then you can spread the formula Okay so we've done that now we already have a solid forecast if you check this forecast we can check this two insert okay I'm going to do it from beginning Ser name t enter and the value T okay and the months the next month's coming this is just show you one example so you can do like this you can even put some maybe colums I know you can see okay you have a big peek then Bo boom and then you are very stable okay so that's a good beginning you have these forecasts oops Tech contrl Z you have this forecast I know what we're going to do we're going to include the seasonality because there is no seasonality
so what we're going to do we're going to you have a seasonality of for example mountain bike you know that you have a seasonality per month and if you remember in my seasonality file I already done this work before so if you check this file you have for example the mountain bike you already have a seasonality which is not the same between January 72% and June 126% so what we're going to do we're going to just copy and paste all of this so you can link to this file you can copy and paste you only do this work once a year usually so you you you don't have to reinvent the wheel so you can just copy and just copy and paste all this uh this seasonality and I put it into seasonality so you have all my seasonality don't forget to copy the link where is the link the link of mountain bike and for the then we we're going to apply we're going to apply the seasonality per month for example you say oh you are in October this is 79% so what we're going to do first we're going to connect this table to my new product launch so what we're going to do we going to first I'm going to teach you how to get this seasonality Factor so we're going to I've did it before I'm going to repeat you're going to vook up V lookup and then you need to connect the subcategory the this one concatenation of this one so to create a link so if I do the link is is just equal this and for example 12 you have Mountain by 12 and that's my connection with the other table and the table you see you have a link mon by 12 this one so I want 67% okay so I'm going back I'm going to do it again V look up the subcategory and 12 and then we're going to do we're going to go back to S and you're going to take all of them from colum B because you have the link and you want the colum three and then zero you do like this great so when you see oh 67% of mon bag let's check 67% of month 12 perfect so it's working what you have to be careful you need to protect o not this one this one F you need to cut protect the colum and then the row and the table you select it you do like this and then you can just copy and paste like this and now you have your seasonality okay you have your seity perment and know the last step is to do what is to you multiply this times the Bas line so the Bas line 60 so when you do that up so you can look the graph below now you have this you're going to press F4 to block my Baseline okay and we're going to do like this and copy and paste the formula I know boom you can see before it was flat and know he's like boom boom and then it's following the seasonality per month and you have a big Peck in May June and July so congratulations for that this is not in percentage this is in number up bam you have your focus and what you can do this is not mandatory you could also work on the the seasonality of the first two months to adjust even more even the lunch so you could just copy and paste this for T and just copy and paste here times seasonality and make sure that you correct to the right months and for this one as well times seasonality and you correct for the right month as well so no it's not 96 anymore 86 is it's not 90 is 80 86 then 38 and now you have your final forecast and and I'm very proud of you I'm very proud of you and we did the same for this one I recommend not to pause the video and to try to include the seasonality of this one and then we're going to get back together okay so now you you made the seasonality I'm very proud of you I'm very lazy so I'm going to do the same I'm going to do this times just copy and paste this formula and you just have to move to this one up now we have this T tac tac I think everything El is okay I do like this you just need to be careful for the first months but then it's always the same formula for the first two months or first two weeks if you have weeks and then for this one times seasonality boom boom T Tac what's going [Music] on it's just more quantity okay so that's it for the the formula with the seasonality and in the next episode I'm going to tell you how to forecast multiple sizes
okay so now we're going to forecast like multiple size for example for this U pink shirt we don't have one but you have multiple size and this is a very classic challenge for for example fashion industry or even manufacturing when you have multiple size of one specific product to be honest I feel it's easier to focus first what we call the super model and then to spread with like a repetition of size what we're going to we're going to do 10% 20% because the more you have data the more you cons the data the more it's the easier it is to to have an accurate forecast so if you have like for example CLA or this multiple size effect I will first forecast the top level and then I will spread with a percentage of distribution and that's what we're going to do now it's not that very complex and the first thing is to like you can add because the real in my specific example this is not the real code the real code are precise right so you include just the new product just here woman the different size same category same subcategory The Collection this is all equal you may have different margin because for example it's cheaper to do a very small product than a very large one in terms of quantity most of the time you don't change the price because you want to make it accessible whatever your the shape of your body which is completely fair and then you should have also the same statue maybe you should not have the same statue but I I I consider that if one of them is not okay then they all have to be confirmed okay then you have the probability and you you are not going to do the same work because it's going to be way too much work if you do it one by one for every single size so you do it at the global level and what is the information that is important is this specific one your size repetition of your different products so how do you get that you need to have analysis of your previous product with the same size repetition so try to get for example the the white or the pink shirt or the blue one and try to see why is a repetition per size you could also have an average repetition for the full subcategory because you don't want you want to keep it very simple but the bigger is your company and the the more attention you need to put into this repetition in this specific example if I look at my shirt my woman summer shirt 10% of the sales are coming from EXs 20% from small 30% from medium 20% from large so you have more sales in the in the middle and then 15% and 5% okay you need to get this information but be very careful to make sure that you check this number while you have full availability of every single size the classic mistake I seen I've seen so many times in my life is you're going to just check the the sales of all the size for the last 12 months but the medium and large were out of stock 3 months and for example XS or XXL was full of stock all the time so it's going to be it's going to amplify the quantity of this specific one say because you had a lot of shortage of this one when you go it's very classic many companies They Don't Really um they just base their repetition based on historic but this one we of stock most of the season so you're going to have a snowball effect that will repeat each year because each year you will have Overstock of the wrong size so you're going to sell more by default and you will have not enough quantity of this one so be very careful to check this number to make it to make sure you have always full availability in the right period of the year then you don't have a a wrong repetition because if you move this one to 20% and you reduce this one by I don't know to 15 it's going to completely change your uh distribution is going to be a challenge for your inventory management also we're going to talk about it later but we have what we call the minimum order impact because of this minimum order quantity that we're going to calculate let's say you need to buy much more of the the small size because of the minimum of production you will have a lot of inventory and then you're going to do a lot of discount because you have too much inventory so when you check off the sales history it's going to be uh you you will think that you are selling a lot of this one but when you look at at the average price you did a lot of promotion because of that so another way as well would be maybe to check the repetition maybe not in value but not in quantity but in value but also make sure that you have the same or not big change on the average price okay so this is a big study like at decad long I could work three months just on this size repetition topic but I just wanted you to give you my personal experience and the mistakes to avoid okay once you have this this is pretty simple you just have to do basically the if you want to have the Baseline okay like this just do time this I'm going to do this one because I can't see my screen I'm going to do this times Baseline okay you're going to log the formula for Baseline okay and then you have your the same Baseline okay and then you you can apply the same first month second month most of the time is the same and then the formula is pretty simple what you going to do next you don't even have to apply the same formula you can apply the percentage of repetition you say this times 10% so 32 I guess yes you have this repetition and you just lock this formula and then because you already made the formula like this you copy like this I did a mistake yes you need to also lock the first row like this there's another problem is not the row what's wrong with that yes you need to lock it's good that I do the mistake for you right it was the colon cuz you want to move I'm always using 10% but you need to go to 20 30 20 sometimes I do my mistakes as well I'm not perfect like you no one is perfect the best way is to learn is to practice so now I have my forecast per size based on this very important number which will really drive all your forecast so make sure you have this number right and the more you will do analysis with no like impact or out of stock the more you will be accurate for you do it for every group of size if you have four product with four size do it for only four if you have group with 12 size do the different repetition for that and in the next episode I'm going to tell you how to calculate the impact of minimum order quantity
okay so now we're going to calculate the impact of the minimum order quantity I was talking about it before this is the minimum order for for example your supplier or your production you cannot just ask one t-shirt right you could or one bike you say I want one bike doesn't work like this you need to prepare the production line maybe you have some adjustment maybe they have to to buy some specific machine recruit people so you always have a minimum order quantity especially if you do manufacturing process and what we need to know is that okay my minimum is 300 what would be the impact on this product and you can see that for this one just by getting 300 products I have 149 days of inventory projected just because of that whatever I'm I'm selling it for one month or two two years and this number is based on the size of the the minimum mod quantity and the forecast so what we're going to do now we're going to calculate this number and this ratio is very simple you're going to divide first you need to get the total quantity so we're going to do total 12 months quantity so equal some of the next 12 months the F with the first month we do 12 months like this and you have this is the quantity and also good to have what is the revenue of this quantity you have total quantity times the price of your product so it's a big deal this one is almost $1 million so it's pretty important and you can also use this as opportunity for your financial forecast if there's you what is the forecast for next year you have you have the Bas line but you have also this new products that will bring $800,000 okay then what we're going to do we're going to calculate the stock turn in days of this mq and for that very simple you're going to divide we're going to redo the formula again uh we're going to do equal the M oq divided by so you could do this number divided by 12 but the best for me is even to do that average of this and you do the average of the next 12 months so you have five but what is this five five is per month so what you have to do is to multiply by the number of days in a month if you want to know in number of days so by average you have 30.5 days per month so at the end you have a number of 149 days okay so we have this number and this is the average and if I go okay now MyQ is going to 700 I have almost one year of inventory this is red y because I don't want to have this and this is a very important process in your company you know I put this red flag by putting conditional formatting and in this I you know what I want to this one one my minimum number to be green oops edit is this number then I I'm put 50% in the middle and then my maximum is 150 if you are more than 150 you are red this is a red flag press okay and then of course if you change this R say no I can have 500 then you can see the color will be completely different why I'm doing this I'm doing this because uh this is most of the company they don't even check what is the impact of the minimum order of quantity and my recommendation is to have this red flag and you should Define this based on the the what we call the stock turn on the inventory turn of a target of your company I'm talking a lot about this in my inventory management expert course but the idea is like if you average of your companies 100 days you don't want to have bringing produ that bring you 300 days of inventory even before the first order right so you have to be very you need to Define what is the maximum that you authorize for your new products to be validated and if they are more than for example 200 this is a red flag and maybe it's rejected by Finance finance will say no this is rejected because this is too much cash flow I don't want to have a one year of inventory of this product especially if they have a very low margin okay so this is a very important process I recommend to have a look look and then you just have to duplicate the formula like this you have to be just Careful by using the formula average is good because if it's blank you will use only the the full one so you can just do like this oops Escape click and do like this and you have all this specific formula let's check if it's working perfect and you have the same for size and what is interesting is like overall you say okay I'm I'm pretty okay I'm not that bad I mean it's not great but it's okay but this size this specific size XX XXL has 478 days which is a lot and maybe it's okay for the medium side but for this 100 and minimum order quantity of 100 my forecast for 12 months it's only six months in this specific case is 38 quantity and you ask me to get 100 and this is a very classic problem but just by seeing that you can say you know what or you negotiate with your supply and you say I'm not taking 100 maybe I negotiate to 30 quantity or I just say I'm not taking this size or maybe I just completely canell the product because this is not profitable but I can already tell you you will have to do a discount of all these products by the end of this year and this discount will impact the size repetition if you don't you not be careful with that so I was a very good example and I really encourage you to at least put this into your process that you aware that sometimes you take way too much inventory even before like having any sales in your in your pipe so I see you for another episode and we're going to update this forecast into the forecasting expir file
okay so now we have the forecast and the next step is to update your forecasting system so maybe it's an Excel file or maybe it's an Erp whatever you're using this is the next step and the most important you need to take this forecast into account so what we're going to do we're going to open my Excel forecasting file and I'm going to tell you how to update a file so what I'm going to do I'm going to take the first one this is my code I'm going to copy like this oh like this you go back to the down of the file make sure there is no filter T Tac right click value and boom you already have all the the row created why because we have a table format That's The Power of table format mountain bike this is uh this time we have a new product you can call it new the Sal Price is this comment okay new September 23 launch right and then you don't have any um anything what you can do you have two ways to do it we're going to do the manual way and then we're going to do the automatic way if you don't even want to use your the other file the manual way is to so right now you don't have you can close this where is this we can remove this and what we're going to do we're going to include so you need to override the focus because there is nothing so to override the forecast it's very simple you start from September so we're going to we're going to hide this one we don't need this one and you're going to overwrite the forecast so I'm going to go back to this T from make sure you have the right months from September and I'm going to select 12 months because because I only have 12 months in my file go back to my file up from September I didn't copy I forgot to copy like contrl C paste value always paste value great we have this we have this forecast oops there is one month I have one month to make I broke the formula so make sure you have 12 only yeah that was 12 ah yeah but I have one here so 11 it's good to know you can also create a file with more than 12 months if you need more than 12 months it's up to you clack so now I have my forecast and I can already see something in my file which is great I have the percentage make sure the percentage that was not clear we have everything we need except that we have zero yeah we have zero here or you can even make to make sure you can put zero here and now we have a forecast we have an automatic forecast there is a conditional formatting that I should remove I don't know where is this one so you can do like this it's a good way as to see if the file is working clear select it Sals perfect T and now we have the forecast so that that is the first step very uh very efficient and um what we're going to do now is like you say you know what maybe I just need the focus at the beginning and then I want the machine to take to control back so what we can do as well is say you know what I just need to launch the product and then I want to make it alive so I'm going to take the first maybe four months and then I'm going to remove this I'm going to remove this and I'm going to see if there is a forecast if I look at my forecast I have zero because I don't have any average sales yet so what you can do is if I go back to my selector and say you know what I'm going to take a new product and what was my my Bas line was 60 and I'm going to force an average by 60 plus my trend of my group and now if I go back to my formula oh now I have a forecast pretty cool now let's have a look of this one into to my skew dashboard look you can see there is no sales history and boom we have the launch and then we have an automatic forecast which is pretty cool right so that's that's the challenge if you only overwrite the forecast here and you leave it like fixed you will never review the this automatically what you can do is like you can force an average you could even generate almost the full forecast like this if you don't have the other tool you could say you know but I'm going to only focus the first two like this oops like this and then I'm going to leave the system to apply the seasonality and all the formula which is also something I could use but you have to be careful at one point you'll have to remove new because you will have the real average sell so maybe at one point you could like in three or four month you could say no I'm going to three months average sales or you could move to 12 months at one point or what you could do as well that's another trick you can say I'm going to pick KCK the 12 month Trend but I'm going to use it to a very similar product M bike I'm going to take a very similar product mountain bike for example I don't know this one and I'm going to even equal to my average demand of the other products so now we have 58 and this 58 will be linked to the other one and if they have the same behavior you could even add the percentage I want 20 80% of the other one and you could even generate another forecast link to another product with a percentage of variation like plus 20% or less 20% if you want to generate an automatic forecast but for that you need to select new like this up now you have this number linked to another product and then after the launch you have an override of the just the the launch and then boom it's going to generate an automatic forecast automatically for you based on or a manual baseline or um a product linked to this one so this one was a bit Advent but you can really do whatever you want because you have all the seasonality and all the trends included in this file which is pretty cool now what you can do you can pause this video and try to include the this specific product into your file so pause the pause the video and try to in include it into my file or delete the lines if you can see the products okay great so now we're going to do this T Tac we're going to copy this nice going to select woman clothing you can just do like this up boom item study new and price 40 like this nice you can call it a launch uh what was the month I forgot zero March 23 nice they are all new so maybe you can say they're all new if you want to force the Baseline T tac tac you go here and then what you're going to do you're going to BU to this one it was March perfect so you don't copy this one because this is not the real product you you work by size and make sure you have the name so you can see I even standardized the name of my product which is very efficient try to standardize the name and I did I'm using this this plus ex EXs uh plus the side so it's a very clear name if people get lost you could also include a size colon into your file forecasting but make sure you make it as clear as possible so I have this concatenation automatic for that so now I go back to my forecast I do like this from March to August I think and I just have July in this one march to August march to August we go here make sure you have the same order right click boom you have the forecast and now you're good to go so to be honest for this one you you don't need to have a specific Baseline so you can just keep it to 12 months but because this is a collection anyway you w have to focus after specific mods and uh yeah I think we're pretty good we have all the focus we need in the in the file and you also have the value per months per category which is pretty cool we we're going to consider consolidate that so find your way you can play with like you could find similar prods directly into your file and say you know what I'm going to link uh this file to a manual baseline or to another another Pro with the similar baseline or you can just copy and paste and when you feel you are ready you switch back your product to an automatic Baseline based on 6 months 12 months and you are good to go so I hope you like this video and in the next one I'm going to tell you how to forecast this continued product
in this video I'm going to teach you how to forecast discontinued product this is a very important topic because sometimes we forget to stop forecasting like very old products and we keep ordering in the system for nothing and it's going to also mess up your financial forecast we're going to do the sum of all your forecast so I'm going to take few example if I take go to discontinued product make sure you have the right status based on the date the starting date and the um the end date and you can also have an automatic series based on the starting and if the today is after the ending date then it's a discontinued product it's the end of the catalog is not part of the current selection that you're promoting to your customers so you need to be very clear with that and make sure there is no more forecasts and for that you have two options or you do it automatically in your formula and you say you had another if if my product is discontinued then I stop the forecast based on the specific date which can be a bit complex and easy if you have an newp system or you know what sometimes you may have like let's check for example this specific product you can say oh this is a discontinued product but I still have a forecast but you know what I'm going to still sell this product because I have a lot of inventory so what you could do as well is say you know what let's say like for example you have um you have 400 and you have 500 products left in your inventory available and you say okay so I need to I need to forecast the inventory left to make sure that it's going to be part of my sales forecast as well but I don't want to get more than that so what you can do is like okay I'm going to have you can add a column with your inventory left or connect to your inventory file and say this product is discontinued when I look at this I say I want to look 500 I have 538 great and I'm going to do like I'm going to do like this and after month 12 I'm going to put zero so I'm going to force the forecast to zero so zero like this and like this so now I'm overriding zero that means that they will no have no more forecast the months after and I would just have enough to liquidate the inventory you can also if you plan a promotion you can say you know what I'm going to do a bigger promotion so 300 and 200 and then zero zero and zero then you have everything left and then you can just check your forecast and you will see it's going to be very very basic T Tac and boom zero very important to override the forecast that was a quick example but if you don't if you're not careful with that you may over forecast on not having the right consolidation we're going to check out to see what is the global forecast and if you keep forecasting if you forget the new products and if you don't remove the old ones you're going to have a problem of consolidation after so it's very simple if you have the the right tool like Excel and try to do it in the most efficient way and I see you for another episode
in this episode I'm going to talk about how to focus Innovative products that never happened before on the market for example Elon Marcy wants to launch this really weird flying bike we don't know exactly what is that but it's very very excited and confident it's going to reshape the bicycle industry and that's a big challenge the option one is to use your crysal bow you don't really know so you're going to you're going to use that I don't have one unfortunately so I cannot teach you how to use it but let's a challenge and the option two is to try to estimate what will be the potential impact for example when we talk about the the The Vision Pro from Apple uh they didn't know at the beginning what was okay what was the demand for that and what they did was like you can promote the event and you can have for example a waiting list you can have a waiting list and you can compare the waiting list of this one versus the previous product and see if there is more interest versus previous products that's that's a good way to start you could also track interest for example on social media you can promote your product on social media and say hey this is the new product and see if you have more interest in terms of comments in terms of views you can see like 56 56 million views is it more than the uh the um the airpod pro more than the iPad Pro etc etc and the more you have information the more you will see interest not only on your channel but if they're talking about it or not you could also do it if you have a B2B busino business um business you could say as to your commercial team to say talk about it to the customer and see if they are interested maybe you can talk to 100 clients and see how many of them show a specific interest or not you can also have a waiting list for VIP clients and see if people are very excited or if they don't really care about it okay so try to track interest the best way for me and we did that a lot in the fashion industry is to test before we use we call test Series so you're going to ship like R in the like very representative stores or clients few few products maybe if you have one, store you're going to do it in 20 stores maybe you can ship with an express delivery by plane or like with a FedEx or UPS and you're going to put the products as normal you don't really promote them to see if they are selling or not more than the other ones or maybe on the e-commerce platform you can do like a very like test series or you can even show the page we're going to talk about with Amazon but just if people are clicking or not that's another one you can also try with one specific region or one specific market for example you try with China where the production is and you even if this is not the exact same Market it could be a good way to try or maybe you can really try with VIP clients you don't need to produce a lot and you can have a good ID or that so this is for me the most efficient ways to to try to sell before and see and compare different pattern versus other new product you can also propose pre-order for example the the Cyber truck from uh from Tesla they had a waiting list it was only a $100 waiting list but this you can also track the interest you could have even a waiting list and you need to pay 20 or 30% of it like can you Nike shoes for example is doing that you pay in advance and you get your shoes two three or four months after you could also just reduce your lead time because why do you need to have an create new products forecast if you have only a one week production lead time or manufacturing lead time right so it's not only about having the B better forecast you could if you have a very shortterm late time and you have a long permanent produ that will save for the next two years this is not that important that you miss the first few weeks and you will create some tension and then you will be able uh to get back to it and have more data for that so this is very complex for example The Vision Pro from Apple they need to build a completely new Factory and new team and it's a lot of quantity for for this one for sure they're going to accept the shortages and they're going to play with that is going to be very rare not for everyone and sometimes you know what it's pretty good to have that especially if you have a very Innovative product and then you can adjust the supply chain based on this volume so be okay also that you you won't be 100% accurate this is part of the game and it could be also very good for your marketing and you have to accept and maybe talk about more what is the probability and what is the risk for my business we're going to talk about it in the future forecasting but I will definitely not take the same risk if I have a very high profit high margin and high probability is going to happen then if this is a non-profitable product with very high cost and maybe I'm going to sell zero and I'm going to have to promote all these products for the next 10 years so think about also what is the probability and what is the risk for uh your company to make sure you go to the right direction and we're going to talk about it if you want to go further with my inventory management expert method we talk about uncertainty and having a different Inventory management strategy based on the level of uncertainty of your product whatever they are very important for your service for your stock and for your profit so we're going to talk about it more if you if you're not part of it already in Inventory management expert and also if you are open where planning to have a new method about SNP that works so if you want to know more about it you can check the link or contact us directly
okay so now we're going to forecast this new category uh for for the forecast of this flying bike so for that we have the new code you have the new flying bike number one and then you have one size and you have a new category so if you have a new category you can add this category directly here flying bike flying bike this is your new category and for the seasonality because you don't have any sales history for this category this is very important you need to have a new you just have basically to C and paste a new block like this I've I've done it already up contrl Z and what will be the seasonality of this product so you could do like we did before you can connect you can create your own seasonality or you can say you know what I'm going to copy to Global because I don't know or maybe to mountain bike because I feel it's like mountain bike so you can do equal to this and you can spread your forecast like this so then you have you will have the same pattern than Global and then you go back to your file you put all this information that's $10,000 bike pretty expensive but it's flying it's pretty cool you check all the status and this one was rejected by supply chain so if it's rejected you you should not submit the forecast uh the probability is very low so I don't really know for this one it's going to be between 10 and 20000 bikes per month so because my priority is low Maybe I go to 20 very close to the down one and also because what is the margin of this 40% margin if everything goes well maybe less then you have the first month I'm using the same than close because this is a very Innovative product so I feel people are going to be very excited that's my assumption and the starting date and the end date okay so then you can see there's a $3 million business opportunity that's very exciting and when I go back back to my forecast this is the same principle I'm going to use there Baseline okay 20 times the first month times the seasonality and the seasonality is based on my flying back category but my flying by category is the same than the global category seasonality okay so once I have this I have my forecast and then okay great I'm going to create this into my focus file I'm going to remove my T Tac I forgot to copy and paste again T tac tac I have one two three four no I need to get this contrl C no first I need to copy the name of the product you can try to do it by the way you can pause the video and do it okay I trust you it's all about trust between us right right then you can see there is no category ah I don't have the category so what you have to do you have to go back to my I think it was in uh trends no it was in seasonality and you need to include a new category so you can do it here you can even do it here flying bike so I don't have subcategory yet so it's going to be the same and you could even connect you know what my flying by category will be like Global so I'm going to do like Global because I don't know so I'm I'm connecting the same I don't even have to create a table I'm just say you know all the flame bike I connected to Global uh in my selector so now I go back to my base I can't see that so what I need to do I need to update my data data validation and I need to go up to row sorry okay playing back and I need to the same for this one I did s because maybe if I have more category I won't have to choose anymore so now you can see flying back flying back and then I have Global this is the category for my seasonality this is a new product obviously very new product the sales price is 99999 very expensive and the common is is new innovation and I forgot the first month I think it was March I don't know no it was November 11 23 T great now I'm going back to my forecast from November contr C and my forecast will be from November Tech number yes this is my forecast I have zero before you can add zero if you want zero zero zero T Tac and there there is no Trend as well because I don't have any Trend in my um in my category so you can also add a trend here flying flying bike and I don't have any Trend but my target will be I don't know maybe I can do 0% now because I have no idea and my selection will be 0% okay so that's just one example just to show you how to update the file when you have a new category and now you can see I have zero because I don't know or maybe I can say you know what it's it's a new category so we're going to push but maybe from next year by 30% so now I have all of this and then we're going to see it's going to be very important to really adjust the forecast quickly uh months months of March if we sell 400 we will have to update this one very quickly and if we S zero we will have also to update this and it looks like we have a supply chain issue so if you have a supply chain issue maybe we will have to postpone all of this maybe to next year if something wrong happen as well so that's it for the a to update your file with new products and I see you for the next one
in this episode I wanted to give you a strong message about how to simplify your life I did the same with promotions and for me you should simplify the new product launch planning as well this is most of the company they tend to launch too many products too often because marketing wants to push more product manager they wants to reent the world maybe they have too many bonuses based on the number of launch and for me like promotion it's very very exhausting because you have too many you have a poor execution between all the department and you don't have enough time to learn and improve the process so my recommendation for most of the companies in the world is to keep it simple to do less but more efficient only maybe less period to launch new products so you have a better like execution you will have also better impact and a clear communication as well for your for your customers wherever they are B2B or b2c and you have a big launch and you have a drop and like promotion Simplicity is key and I to give you the same message for that because you can do your best to improve the process if you have way too many things to do you will work like a firefighter anyway and yes my structure can help you to maybe improve the accuracy by 20 30% but at the end it will be a wrong business strategy so maybe you don't have the power to change that but at least recommend that and by also tracking the performance of the previous launch you will be able to show that guys let's try to do two times less launch next year but let's do it great and when we have at like a good maturity level we can go to the next level and maybe try to launch more like Zara is used to do that because it's a very powerful machine but it took it took for Zara many many years of practice and methodology to go to this level and also I wanted to to conclude with the Apple again business perform me it's a multi billion and billionaire business and they keep it very simple for new launch if you look at the new iPhone during 10 years it was almost launched ex the exact same day 12 of September 10 of September 9 9 7 12 12 10 there is only one in 2020 and I think it was I think it was because of the pandemic but it's almost exactly the same moment and when you do that it's very powerful for the execution you don't have a problem of seasonality you don't have a problem of execution even the customer and I have an iPhone and I know okay this this is mid of September there is a new iPhone coming maybe this is the right time for me maybe not and this is for me the very very good example and Steve Jobs was obsessed not only by the design but also by the Simplicity of the process and the new CEO after while really focusing on having Simplicity in all over for promotions for new products for forecasting for everything in your life and life simple can be other than complex and you have to get to get to work out to get your thinking clean to make it simple and I can tell you you can really as say the team just move mountains if you keep a very simple and hey piness so think like this and I see you for another episode
all right Mario so now let's reveal the secrets of Amazon how do you forast the new product is it easy for you yeah so no no no special secret I think I'm gonna give you the same response as I give you all the time meaning that we have a specific machine learning algorithm okay that is specifically designed for forecasting new products okay new releases product that you know haven't been selling before um yeah and the I think what's what's interesting is the what are the key inputs for these models and uh because we don't have sales sister of course so it's definitely the uh item name and anything any any kind of information related attribute to the product okay so it it allows the algorithm to cl to Cluster the product in the right category and then what we have is the what we call the glance views okay the views basically of the of the page of the product so even though the product is not selling yet uh most of the times you you still have a detail page I still have a page okay where people can land and see of course the number of views is super low compared to what we have when the product is actually buyable when people can buy it okay but it al already gives you a hint of what the what the trend is going to be because you can always compare it with a similar product yeah that was uh uh registering you know as as many of view as this one for example yeah and then you can interpolate and tell and say for example I don't know uh he had like 100 views per day and then has been selling at 100 units per day okay for example and then you can do kind of similar calculation so I think that's a very good example and when I was working with the catlan we were doing also pre pre- Series in like we had 2000 star and we were shipping to 50 different store only average store like very representative and the idea was really to uh to have an idea of the the average sales of this product only in this very specific location before doing the full forecast 6 months after and uh at the end we need to have comparison and the more you have comparison with similar products or maybe not the same amplitude it could be 10 times less but you can do a correlation and I guess your your blackbox machine learning find something like that so if I take for example this tablet this new tablet I guess that you will probably connect to the previous tablet not necessarily from Amazon right and you're going to you're going to see not necessarily for Amazon but we can we can you know you can understand that maybe those from Amazon since being the same brand and brand is a very popular attribute of the of the item uh probably those those would weight more okay uh but then yeah similar tablets as well because you know and also consider what time of the year you know if you're launching in Christmas is not the same as if you're lunching in January you know there are some variables like this uh which the algorithm is aware and then you have to you have to keep into account and if you if you are not Amazon you were mentioning the idea of social media or to post something what was your recommendation you were sharing before yeah yeah that's that's I think that's a very good one um um as as long as it's a it's a it has to be a practice right so you can be you can have a common practice of posting u pictures or short videos of the item uh or the service uh you will sell in social media for example and um you know you can measure the interest that people have how many views how many likes how many comments uh of course it's going to be like super low but you can compare it with another item where you did the exactly same thing okay so you know you're gonna say oh you know this particular one I had I don't know a thousand likes yeah and then this one I only had 500 okay which being similar products you know it seems like this one is going to have uh you know less of a success so you know a good idea and uh even yeah I think it's a very good and not only for e-commerce business but you could also if you have a B2B business you could also just send a presentation of the product to one, client and see just how many reply how many share an interest and I think at the end you need to find a way to anticipate the future because you don't have any story on this products or by comparable or by uh showing the product and try to uh to to to see the level of interest and compare different level based of different amplitude and even for my course to be honest when I sell my online course I send email I send a for example survey and I know like for forecasting I like three times more question than for another topic so I can say okay this this going to be very interesting so we're going to probably focus our energy on this one and forecast to have the best expert on the planet on this one so thank you Maya for being here so now that was that was for similar products okay you can compare but what what about if you have a product that was never sold before like we had this very good example of the Apple Vision Pro when they had to forecast for the first time or maybe we have a new flying bike uh coming for I Will Survive how do you do that yeah again it's it's it's super difficult I think here especially for so it depends on the product okay so you're you're speaking about h a brand new products in a brand new market and and it's a you know it's very expensive it's a lot of the brand Al is is depend depends or the future of the brand depends on this product okay if it was a brand new toilet paper for example I think it would have been you know much easier although although you know super easy it would be would have been much easier to to forecast so this one in particular I think what you have to do you have to be um you have to be um um you have to recognize that there is a uncertainty okay and you have to uh measure that uncertainty so you can say for example uh I think I'm GNA sell between I don't know 1,000 and 10,000 units okay and I'm giving an amplitude of like 10 times but it could be much much higher it could be like a 100 times okay so you have to be conscious you have to tell to yourself okay what's what's the real minimum and maximum I can sell about of this item right and then based on you know what's the margin of this item is it very high is it very low okay um what's the uh what's the um what's his a stake for the brand okay or how much this is critical for the customer okay so based on this information then you you have to choose when you buy the item to take more or you know more or less risk okay so meaning more risk then you're gonna buy more you're gonna tend more towards a higher forecast and then if you know if if the item is not very profitable there is no much at stake then you would just take less risk and and you know if you go out of stock no big deal right makes sense yeah it makes sense and for me I go back to two main pillars for your forecast is your if you at least if you manufacture or sell product is like lead time and uncertainty and if you have a very short lead time to replenish if you have only three days to replenish your products or to manufacture it's it's not very your initial f is not that important but if you have six months lead time and a big uncertainty the potential risk of making or losing money can be a critical and that's why you should you should to improve the forecast one way is also to reduce the lead time or to do press series or to retry as much as possible to have to reduce the level of uncertainty of your product and uh we we are talking about the PlayStation before uh like you have the new PlayStation coming you say it's not an easy game what would you do for that yeah again we we we leave this to the uh uh to to the account managers uh manage so it's not ma yes of course there is machine learning but then they have to check right they have to check if the output from the machine learning is correct okay um you know um there are allocations for these kind of items so you cannot really reorder okay it's almost one shot so you better tell the you know the right number um and um yeah these people again the account managers who manage these kind of products which raise a lot of stake uh they are they are super experienced okay they have tens of years of experience they know exactly what they're doing they know how much start taking yeah they they're constantly measuring their performances um yeah because because like so much at stake U you know yeah so I think that's a very good example as well is how to having the right people as well with the The Good exper the people who knows better the market who have the more responsibility to improve the forecast and also I guess you also track the accuracy of the new product as well uh and I think one of the main mistake i' I've done myself is like we spend a lot of enough time to to do the forecast 12 months before for example then we forget about it we don't even readjust the forecast before the launch and sometimes you have massive different with even the the price can be different or the the colors can be different so I think it's a it's a oneoff process that is a bit lost and I think also one of the mistake is there is no quick review just after the launch uh to see if it's really working to readjust quickly the forecast and make sure you don't Overstock your product for one year you not out of stock very quickly and yeah yeah that's why I think having some visibility on social networks or on your website and keep tracking of the views it gives you a hint of what if interest is building up or is actually uh lowering down okay it allows you to make this adjustment even though you haven't started uh to sell your product yeah if you have a B2B companies it's a bit more challenging but you can you can always uh they I think that the challenges ought to be more proactive uh before and after than just where is my best forecast all right May thank you so much oh you want to say something no no no it's okay I think even if you're a B2B I think you always have to look at the final customer demand okay because because you know the the Distributors can get it wrong right Distributors can say oh we're gonna sell a ton of the stuff they maybe buy a lot in the first place but then you don't sell it to the final customers so they will just not they they will not reorder okay yeah so if you if you if you were you know if you were buying to fulfill their first order plus you know a buffer inventory for the you know next and third round of ordering then you will you will you will basically uh uh you know those those those extra um stock will will will be Overstock basically yeah so I think it's a yeah it's a very very good point thank you for sharing and I see you for another episode
in this chapter my friends we're going to talk about how to measure analyze and review your forecast so we did a great job already I can tell you if you already applied even 50% of the methods and tools you already know much more than many people fusing on this planet and we did a lot of Step from collecting defining the goals choosing the right model focusing Bas like new prods promotion but it's also important to make sure it's not only a one shot process you need to measure analyze and review on the on this in a in a regular base if you want to make sure you improve your your performance on the long term so what we're going to we're going to talk now we're going to talk about how to improve how to review how to adjust but before going into Excel talking about ABC analysis XY that forecast accuracy Gap analysis I wanted to go back to the planning the forecast review planning I was an snop manager for for many years s SNP for sales and operations uh plan sales and planning and the make sure is to make sure you align all the department into One Direction and we're going to talk about it during the next chapter as well but this is just an example of planning that you should follow if you are if you have a company doing forecast and when this start start from the finance budget forecast so you have the finance budget forecast that you're going to do probably the year before not in January for the same year you're going to do it few months before and if you go back to the fin Finance forecast review you have the budget in October and then you have the review what what my friend Jeremy the CFO was explaining usually you have a review uh at the end you do one before the the start and then you do one review mid of the Year July if you have a fiscal year from January to December when I was in Australia my fiscal year was July to June so this is one example just uh for uh the the classic January to December but uh this is a just one example so the finance forecast we talk about it before you have the global Target you have the Target by category most of the time is done by the the CFO and the CEO but I really encourage you to be part of this review uh if you're not part of the finance team maybe supply chain sales for example this is a very macro strategic forecast total maybe Brand level country level but they are not going a product by product unless you have a huge launch for next year like a new flying back which will impact uh the total results okay then if we go back to this one then we have what we call the company launch meeting I'm going to go back to it with communication most of the company at least they should do it but once you have all the target for the year not only financial but the IDE is read together everyone and when I was in my company we had always this big meeting with everyone Finance operation sales marketing and the CEO was presenting the target for the new year then the CFO the financial Target then the product manager the new products like for example hey this is the new products we're going to launch then marketing the new marketing strategy then sells the new opportunities on but also risk risk and opportunities and it was really a way to gather everyone and to be on the same page and make sure that we are all going to the same direction so this meeting is very very important I hope you have won if you have you don't if you don't have one you should start one then we have the trend and seasonality review uh uh we already explained this in my previous chapters the season I recommend to work on the season once a year I like to do it in January because I like to Do complete year and for the trend once per quarter I like to do it with Finance sales marketing and product and for the trend you keep in mind if you use my method I like to have a trend selection per subcategory and this is I like to do it at least at the beginning of the year and then we we cons we consol that uh we we make sure that the trend is not moving too much every quarter or at least twice a year to make sure you you don't miss something so the trend and seasonality is still strategic not too operational we're going to keep at the category or subcategory level and you can see we do it one early in the year and once per quarter just a review a quick review to see if you don't have massive gap between the reality and the current Trend you have okay so that is the trend review then we have what we call the snop meetings so you can have have different name for that for me the goal of whatever you call it SN or not the goal is to align everyone to One Direction and I recommend to do it once a month at the global level for me it was my I was leading this meeting and it was with all the directors uh but you can also do it if you have a big company by category or subcategory and the IDE is to review the performance the new product okay what are the new products coming what also the were the past performance of the past launch what is the result of the like the promotion same for promotion and new products we do a top down bottom up Gap review I'm going to explain you to that how to do that in Excel after you talk about the new risk and opportunities you talk about past and future all the time and the IDE is really to find a forecast consensus between all the department especially for like new things happening not only the Baseline but new things like promotions new products or risk opportunities for the business Okay so s meetings I could talk about it for years I was I was leading this these meetings but we're going to talk about it more into details and and if you want to go deeper one day I will also publish a specific course on snop or to set up an SN process so the SN is like from strategic to operation U you can really move from model to Brand level and then we go to the the micro level the weekly and Daily Review of your forecast and this one should be every week and every day and this is the job of most of you and it was my job as well is how to review your forecast accuracy so is really to review the the to track the accuracy first to really focus on the main errors and deviation to ref focus on a and because because the top sellers to uh we're going to talk about ABC XYZ analysis chart analysis root cause analysis and button up button up and top down analysis as well so that's where we're going to start first how to do this operational analysis and then in at the end of this chapter we're going to talk about macro and GAP analysis to make sure that you have a global picture of how to review your forecast on a daily weekly monthly quarterly and annual basis to improve the performance of your accuracy
so now let's go back to basis I'm going to talk about one more time abc analysis you probably already know ABC analis so you can accelerate this video but I feel it's very important to go back from basic and then we're going to go back to excel but very simply if you don't know this rule the 20180 rule 20% of your cause of action will give you 80% of your results and it's coming from Fredo parto whatever you apply it for your clients your products your customers your suppliers the time you invest you have probably 20% of your friend you spend 80% of your time even like for people who are Comm committing like a fraud or robbing stuff it's 20% of the people who commit 80% of the crime etc etc for the food as well I like to give this example from my fridge I 5% of my product in my fridge I will provide 40% of my meal 20% will provide 80% of my meal so for me it's obvious a lot of bread uh I love I love a lot of vegetables and fruits to be honest I'm I'm very healthy um I I I don't have croissant every day uh but yeah if you look at your your fridge you also have this very like weird stuff or maybe this the spicy sauce that you only use two two or three times a year this is not the most important product you need to have you need to survive so you need to have bread and cheese in your in your fridge right so at the end to use the ABC analysis the idea is really to classify products customers suppliers projects investment problems regarding the forecast we're going to really focus on products and then when you classify you focus your time your energy your risk your cash your inventory and also the communication you don't want to send an email to like a very small product which has poor forecast accuracy you want to focus your time and energy to the most important one all the time because it's impossible in a company to fix to have perfection on every single products for it's impossible to have 100% of accuracy on all your products so that's the idea of that and if you talk about number of items regarding the volumes we're going to do an ABC classification one more time you've probably done that multiple times with me if you follow my other methods and course but we're going to go from a b c the the 5% of the item represent 40% of the volumes I recommend to do it in value than quantity and then we have the 2080 and then you have the the C Cod that you probably know already and the focus is really okay you have a Cuts B cuts and C Cuts these kind of products are more important for the business they are more permanent they they provide much more Revenue so you want to make sure you have more accuracy more service and more focus and time and energy on this specific project than this one that maybe are they look cool but they represent maybe like one or 2% of your revenue and you you want to make sure that this one are more important to to to make sure you have a better service so I explained this graph before after this is the service level and the inventory level but you could also switch to accuracy and that's what we're going to do now we're going to go back to Excel and I'm going to tell you how to classify your product a b c
all right so let's go back to excel now I recommend you to download this file again this is not the exact same file than before why because I did some change in the in the file first of all I included the new products if you remember we were adding new products this is the new products so we do have new products from my previous episode where we have uh this all this new products like the the flying back for example and I also did some adjustment in the file I included for example in the Target the flying by category and also I did some fix in my few of the formula uh for example for the ABC analysis I did some change so make sure you download this latest file below the video and now we can start with the ABC analysis okay so the goal of the ABC analysis is very simple is to have a BC and maybe D D for discontinued product okay so what we're going to do we're going to do this again so maybe you already done that before for in the past with my previous course I always repeat this method because this is the most simple one and this is the most easy the simplest one to get very fast fast result the goal is really to focus your time and energy on the most important product and this is the same for forecast accuracy so we're going to do that there is one specification I just before you accelerate the video if you already know my my principle I've did I didn't do it from the last the last 12 month Sals I did it with a mix of cells and for forecast so how do we do that we're going to go back to the base or you do just simply the 12 month sales so you do average quantity of the last 12 months times 12 times the sales price so then you have the total 12 months in the past okay so that's one method and the other method is if you go to the right so we do have the forecast here for the next 12 months and you just multiply the forecast here this forecast so this 19 multiply by the the sales price okay 90 * 1680 so I just add this colum which is very useful because we're going to do all the classification and all the consolidation to Gap analysis in dollars in values okay so I recommend to always have this so I have the next 12 months forecast and then I have two new colums the first one is TW the sum of the 12 months forecast in dollar so basically just the sum and the second one I did a mix of six month sales plus 6 months forecast so if you look at my formula t t t here we go I do have the 6 months quantity times the price nice plus the sum of the next 6 month forecast so why I'm doing that because if I only take let's keep it simple if I only take the classification of this for example so you do like largest to smallest I want have products new products for example and you want to focus make sure you you spend your time on new products if I look at for example my flying bike where is my flying bike my flying bike here you see there is no cells so when I'm going to focus my time energy if I if I base this on that it won't be a is going to be a c cut and I I don't want that I want to include this into my classification so now let's say no why not taking only the forecast if I take only the forast this is my total forecast so I only care about the future let's do like this largest smallest now you can see that number one is the flying bike because it's going to make 2.3 Millions the next 12 month which is a lot of money if this is this product is happening it's a new it's a $10,000 keep in mind so if I do that I will consider only the future but sometimes you know because maybe the flying back will not appear maybe my forecast is completely wrong so what you can do is a mix that's why I recommend to do six months for sales and forecast then you can mix the the past history and the future forecast and if you do that and we do largest to smallest you can see I still have my flying bag but he's not number one he's not number one and we consider also a very stable products for very long time okay so this is what I recommend is to do a mix if you have Focus if you don't have Focus keep it simple and just use the last 12 months I like to use one year if you have very like volatile products or if you have like only fashion products you can switch to maybe the next three month forecast or 6 months okay um so that's it for the the introduction now what we're going to do we're going to go to we're going to create a pivot table to do automatically my abc analysis it's going to take like 10 minutes so if you done that before you can accelerate this video uh but I just want to do it again to make sure it's clear for every everyone so what we're going to do insert pivot table from table and range new worksheet yes all right and what are we going to do first I've done that multiple times I think I did a 1,000 ABC analysis in my life that's going to be the 10001 item code item name do I need 10m yes let's try to do the same then I'm going to do my average let's do the three mons t t okay now we're going to go to design no subtotal of tabular form great I will insert one more colum I'm going to go create ranking then what we're going to do we're going to filter like we're going to switch this into dollars and I want to filter down from the the biggest value from my I'm going to take six months s plus 6 months forecast so we're going to do like this more s options descending and then you can choose the one you like if you don't forecast you can just use this one if you if you trust your forecast just use the forecast and we we're going to do like this so now I have an automatic uh like descending filter from this specific um field and the good thing is each time you're going to update your forecast or update your file or update yourselves you're going to automatically update your classification which is great this is what you want so now we have this the next thing we're going to add the ranking so one two I'm going to double click like this up and you know what maybe you will have new products in your in your catalog so we're going to extend this just in case you have more products coming okay always keep 20% more then you don't have to redo this file again you're going to spend 15 minutes now but then it's going to be done forever for the rest of your life in this company uh all right so now we have this then we're going to do the sum sum of dollars and count count item for the sum of dollar is same oops I need to change my my keyboard because I I recorded this course in French as well yesterday I always do a two language which is a lot of work but a lot of fun as well and then you have another formula this formula is called count if and the IDE is really like you can do like this you have multiple form but the is really to count what is more than zero but I will do it for the item codes so the idea is to count how many code do we have we have 58 codes items that we're going to do for the classification nice what is the next step the next step is to add this this and this so we're going to do like this percentage of item we're what we're going to do we're going to Simply do this divide it by this and we're going to press F4 this is the percentage of item cumulative one so for example the 10 item represent 2% of my total catalog then the percentage of my dollars so my dollar I'm going to divide this one so don't do like this don't get the pivot table you just press it's F4 divided by the sum F4 like this so now you have this this item represents 3% of the total revenue like 6 months sales and forecast then you do you done you go down like this and then for this one you do this plus the previous one now these two represent 6% these two values and then you just do like double click boom and you have the total great I know if you want to have your ABN code like the basically this is 5% of Europe if you go 40% so these products represent 40% so these are a code and then the next are B code and then C code so we're going to add a formula for that you can just copy and paste the same tab if you are lazy like me so we're going to do like this from K K1 K1 nice and I'm going to copy and paste my formula try to do the exact same position and know do you see I have a formula I've done this formula multiple time but it's just if my percentage of dollar is less than 40% and then then I'm putting the a code K K2 is a if it's less than 80 then it's B and if it's more than 80 it's C simply okay and I just said at the end a condition if this is a if there is no value this is black automatically I have my colors and my classification a n c and when I reach the bottom you know when you have no value I just say okay if this is empty I don't want zero I don't want to have a code C so I just add this because if you have more code coming when you refresh this tab when you're going to refresh you'll have more codes coming and I just want to make sure this is automatic like this so now we have all of this good job you can also count the number of item a b and c so account a count B and count C and you can see we have 20 items that represent 40% of the dollars 61 that represent 80% 61 1 plus 60 + 20 so 81 that represent 80% of the revenue and then the rest is 4 product so at the end we have a 440 1680 and then 84 which is pretty close to the ABC analysis if in your company you you see that you have like zero you have only one or two produce you can change this value if it's really exceptional but in most of the case you will be close to this repetition of ABC analysis okay if you want you can also do a shot you can do a shot like this t t Tac I'm I'm not going to do the full shot because it's going to take another 10 minutes but this is my shot clack and you can do the same here you can add some uh like like row you can draw ABC like this and display that in your in your that PowerPoint for your like Board of director to see hey this is my repetition I what is very interesting is to see that and to have the clear details of the list once you have this then it's very simple you go back to your base and you just do a vook up first you say because do you have a question with discontin prod do you want to have this discontinued prod as part of the ABC Andis in my previous course I was not you you have two options you can filter you can remove the discontinued code from this so you can say oh I want to remove this from my classification and say I don't want this continued code like this or you can just say you know what I'm going to keep all of them because maybe I'm still selling few products like discontinu products or I want to I also want to have new products in my in my tab but in my formula I say you know what I want to see because in foring it's good to know if they are discontinu quickly so I say if my item C is discontinued then D otherwise I do a v look up and I just get this information of this column okay so now we have the ABC analysis and you're ready to go you can just in a very visual way so I a conditional formatting if this is a then green like this manage rules t t Tac like this is the one edit rules if this my silver is equal to a then green which is a very visual visual way to really see quickly okay what's happening with this oh is a Cod so and this is a very important one I need to focus okay so later I'm going to tell you all to analyze but but I really like to have this kind of visual then you can really focus your time and energy to the more simple product then you can go to the B Cod etc etc so thank you for watching and I see you for another episode where we're going to analyze the the product with the the dashboard of the product
in this episode I'm going to talk about the scoot dashboard so we what we did before is to do we did ABC analysis and now you say great I want to analyze my acod but you know what it's not easy I really like the visual way to analyze my products and this is not a mandatory episode you you can skip this episode and press on next if you if you feel it's too much for you but the idea is like you have this product you want to analyze this product but looking like this is great but this is better if you go like this and you copy and paste your code and boom it's changing automatically you can see everything with the shot and everything into One dashboard I think this is something very powerful for you and for my team I was always using the visualization to teach and to see what's going on and in a in a glance you can really see quickly if there is a problem with your forecast which is not the case with this one so I'm going to give you like few advice to help you to build your own dashboard you can follow the exact same structure than me or you can also create your own on one this is Advanced because you need we need to use Advanced Excel formula in my example but at least I will give you the inspiration to maybe create use most of the company I see they don't have this kind of visualization or they use one from an Erp and it's really ugly and it's not easy to use and uh I I feel like or you do it in Excel or in software but I feel it's very very important to to have a good uh data visualization and what I like with Excel it's very flexible and you can really custom like you like so what do we do first you need to have I like to copy and paste so you have the code copy and paste and you you have this all of this is just like super V lookup when I have this I have I will get the name the category this is all this information are the same than in my base so I'm just getting the same information in a glance I'm using a formula called index match so maybe you don't know index match if you are not comfortable you can follow my course called Excel experts this is just a super Val cup which will automatically find the the right colon I don't need to specify the colon uh the the match function will find the the colon and and the row for me but at the end I just get automatically you can check the formula why I'm using index match because when you change I I I had to change a lot of colums and when you insert a new colum you have to change the color number for your V cap so it can be a it can break your file that's why for specific dashboard like this I like to make it secure and I use index match and whatever I insert any column is going to keep finding the right information because it's going to for category for example it's going to look for category and for the code and write and find the perfect match so this is the first block to have all the information you need then you need to have the dates the sales and all of this so let's start with the First Column I'm going fast but just to give you ideas you can slow down the video if you want you need to have the date so so first you need to have what is the what is the current date right and for that you can open this and you say oh there is something behind for the DAT you can see this is the current date this date is coming from my file level so I'm getting this information for my latest update this is linked to my base in my base I have eight and if you look above I have the dates clack this is the the current date I have and this this will link everything to my dashboard okay so I have a link on this I go back to my dashboard and then I can say Okay I want to have the last 24 months and I want to have the next 12 months of forecast okay so what I'm going to do I'm going to use the formula called e dat start date and months I'm going to do start date minus 24 for 24 months before you can do the same with week you can use the same kind of graph with week but at the end I have an automatic minus 24 so when I'm going to go to September this going to go to September 21 automatically it's going to be updated okay so now I have this gr and automatically I will get all my date for the past and for the future I use the same I go zero + 1 plus 2 plus three so I have this automatically nice the next step is to get the the sales so for the sales I just do V lookup simply of the colon and my con number from My Level tab so I just do a v lookup from this one and if I want I just get for example if I want my latest eight of August this one it's the color number two so if I go back to my dashboard this is colum number I'm not getting the two the three because the two is my current month I'm not taking the current month so I'm only taking the July one because this one is not complete I only want complete month and yes if you want the the current one this is the value this is the value we have okay so we have we have the the current sales which is great and then I want to compare to the sales correction because keep in mind we did some sales correction if I go back to this one you can see oh 2011 but we did a correction to 133 if I go back to my file here you have 1 3 three why because we did an automatic cleaning with two times the standard deviation so that's why the maximum is 133 that's why we have 133 here but it's good to know and I don't see that in this uh in this tab I like to know but what was the initial value and that's what we can see it's very good to see the difference and also at the conditional formatting is these two are different so this one is red then you just get the avability for the avability I get I get it from the avability tab I do an index match to make sure you could also use a vooka but it's easier with index match if you move anything in your file so I get this information from this tab okay check my formula if you want to understand deeper then I get my forecast so my forecast in the past is just equal to my sales because I I don't want to have another curve I just want to see my sales history and in the future I just V look up so I you look up from colon 63 I could also use a an index match but I did I use a video C for this one just to show you multiple way to do it and this is my forecast so if you go back to my base I have 9078 and this is colum number 60 from item to this one this is colon 63 for my vup so go you can see 63 and my vup is using 63 to my V cup so I have all my forus then I I just by I it also say you know what I want to see the automatic Fork the one I created on the side so this is just I just created a link and say you know what you do colon 63+ 12 and we're going to go back to this forecast you don't have to use this one this is not mandatory but you can compare to see oh maybe I should use this one for this specific case right so this is another forecast if you want to compare another forecast and then you have a new if you want even to try a third one I'm using the automatic Focus from Excel to see what would be the the the new automatic Focus so now you have all of this you have you can even try if you want you can even do an overwrite and say you know what I want to overwrite to 100 here and it's going to draw override if you want to simulate an override in your in your chart so you have all of this and then when you have this time you just create this graph okay so you just take all the information I also like to display the avability and the avability see I'm going to get one code with all of stock for example this one the road bike you can see we have a lot of out of stock and also at a sh like a a graph in the secondary axis to make sure I can and I I I did like a very high scale then the the avability is like in a different color and you can really see on the graph what's happening which is very very interesting also you can see the sales correction when I do correction there is a different shart between this one and this one this one and this one is different and in this case I can see everything on this chart you can also include an linear Trend like this add a trade line you can add a TR line like this etc etc so I think we're good to go so we have the shart which is very very powerful it's completely automatic each time you're going to copy and paste a code and also include the seasonality and for the seasonality I just get did a v cup you can see there is a vup from my seasonality tab linked to my subcategory so there is a subcategory here and I'm linking this my road bike men is equal to my category here for my seasonality and I think I need to road bikes category category seasonality the category seity is this one up there we go and I think we're good to go so once you have this you ready to analyze and I'm using when I even when I was building the file I did a lot of check I did maybe 1,000 check on this to make sure there were no problem with my forecasting model and this is a good way to see oh this is my forast and you can even say you know what for this specific case I'm going to maybe overwrite this I'm going to override my focus here and maybe I'm going to copy this one into my base I'm going to replace my focus because it looks like it's more accurate than this one so always think about the visual this is the best way to understand your model and improve uh and understand the root cause analysis and I see you for another episode
all right so now let's talk about the shortterm forecast review this is a method that is very useful because you don't even have to track the forast accuracy and I'm going to show you what to do and what is uh what are my recommendation this is this column so if you go back to my file you can see VAR VAR three three months and 6 months this is the variation between my past sales and my future forecast so this is really a very safety check that you can do for for any reason maybe you know forast accuracy is too complex for you but you want you want to make sure there is no like crazy value happening and you want to make sure that there is a there is a there is a weird difference between the the short the past the last three months or six months and the next six months so this is very very simple we just do a simple variation I'm going to do it again for you so you just have to do the equal I need to change my keyboard again Su you're going to do the sum of okay of this divided by the sum of don't take the current months because it's not finished not completed minus one so when you do this what does it means mean like this next three months oh I didn't pick the right one you need to pick the yeah so this this one clack minus 10% so if you do the sum 80 and the sum of this is 89 so you have 10% difference between these two this one 66% and then I just have a conditional formatting this conditional formatting is based on this is col BK BK this one and I just said number numbers numbers numbers and I link to minus 50% and plus 50% of course you can change this these colors going to close this you could say no I want minus 20% and it's going to change all your colors automatically but at the end the goal for that is to make sure that you uh you can see that there is big difference and when you filter for example this one and let's do the same for this one so you can yeah you can do the the sum of the average I did the average but you can do average like this an average it's better the average because if you have if you have a new products you will consider this into the calculation as well so for this one we have the same result and then you can do the same calculation for six months I have a more advanced formula I'm going to get back to that but if you look at the three months for example you can also add if you want a if error if error because you have new products then zero T you when you can see that you can very quickly just filter and say you know what I just want to see the the My Crazy values so we can say number filter let or you can filter like this let's take only the A and B code let's combine my abc analysis great and now you can say I want to have the largest when you see that you say okay this product for example is you can see it's very intermittent and is is forecasting the next three months are 264 more than the last three months in the past so maybe you can have a look on the graph that's why you also use the dashboard and say okay when I look at this one we had we had a lot of uh shortages for this product but when I look the curve of this product with the seasonality it doesn't look it looks okay for me okay so I'm not into alert because it's mainly due to out of stock and um when I see that it doesn't seem like it's I'm over focusing just because my period is very very bad in terms of um of avability and then when I look the variation of 6 months it's only plus 37% for the second one I can see there is also this the reason is availability for the third one let's have a look at this one okay so one we see now this F we can see there is a there is a strong Trend we looks like we we are a bit above with of course we also have the seasonality so maybe in this specific one you say you know what when I see this one maybe I'm too high so I can I can look on my forecast and we have a trend we have a plus 23% Trend maybe I'm going to switch to plus 0% because I don't I don't see the same Trend when I go back to my dashboard boom now it looks like it's more it's more reasonable for this specific forecast okay that was just one specific example uh but the idea is really to allert you for extreme value where is the extreme value yes positive but also negative let's get for example this one this one you can see that you are doing less than the months before why because also we had a we had an exceptional Camp kit sales in July so in this specific one we know but sometimes you want you would miss something and you would say ohus 30- 31% what's happening here and you can say okay now we are going down but this is also the seasonality so that's why I'm going to introduce you another topic is the seasonality if we go back to this formula I'm going to do contrl Z multiple times T Tac T tac tac contrl Z you can do contrl Z as well T Tac de contrl Z back okay when you look at my formula what I included as well is the seasonality coefficient why because if I go back to for example my seasonality tab when you compare three months and sigma this is this is very efficient but you also have seasonality and it's normal to have variation for example when you look at my shot you look at my shot if you look at if you're in gener and you look at in the future it's normal that you are going up so it's normal that the next 3 months or 6 months are going up and if you are here it's normal that you are going down we are knowing August so we have a decline of most of the category especially the one selling in summer so for that what I'm going to include in my in my formula this is not mandatory but if you already have this information is the what we call the deas deseasonalized coefficient and I use it as well for my selector this is quite Advanced but I show it for you if you select for example 3 months my de seasonaly coefficient is 96% so I'm going to remove 4% of my average sell okay so we're going to use the same coefficient for this ratio next three months to basically to erase the seasonality effect and where do I get this V cup I get this V cup from the same table I was using before and for example if I go to mon B I'm going to go to do three months and my season coefficient is this one so if I'm in August I have 79% so I'm going to remove I'm going to reduce my average by 21% okay so automatically I'm going to get this coefficient if you want to know more about it you can go back to the seasonality chapter and I'm going to explain to you the way it works so I'm taking the colum from uh this one and two three 4 six seven okay so I go back to my base I take the colon seven and for this want attack the colon six because this is a six months so at the end we have all of this and this is a very good Visual Alert to make sure that you don't have something weird happening with your forecast this one is normal this is a new product this one you can see you have commments but you should make sure that for biggest variation you always have an explanation why you have a big variation and this is not because of seasonality for this specific one so think about this way to track your accuracy this is a very simple way you don't use the seasonality if it's too complex and in the next episode we're going to talk about forecast accuracy
in this episode I'm going to talk about forast accuracy Horizon what is Horizon we talk about forecast accuracy Ms before so keep in mind we have two methods I recommend the BS and the M AE the mean absolute error or the mean absolute deviation this is the two I recommend I do not recommend the map this is the same P product but if you combine multiple products you don't have any value waiting so the like the small value for example if you sell a plastic bag they're going to have the same impact than very expensive products and the rmse is only used for data science and machine learning you will have the same overall result but you will you will have a a cleaning of the main outliers in terms of accuracy but this is way too complex so what we're going to keep we're going to keep these two but there is a very important topic I didn't you didn't talk before whatever you talk about Bas or you talk about Focus accuracy in general it's about the focus or so let's say you want to forus in may you have this may and you want to forus what will be my demand in May and you did different forecast you did a forecast my you know like in May your demand was 1,000 okay but that was the different forecast you did in January before and you first you forecast 500 then you did 700 then you did 900 so you change your focus for the same month of May then you switch to 1,100 and then you decide deed to keep 1,100 but the final result was 1,000 what was your forecast accuracy which forus should you consider for the month of May one months before two months before 6 months before so now I'm going to give you the uh ideal way the ideal way you should get your supply lead time per item that would be the theal waste if for example if you have a 90 days lead time you should consider to have uh to consider because if you need 90 days to supply and you change the forecast one day before it's going to be too much to supply the Demand right if you talk about supply chain if you don't have any supply chain issues there is no problem you can just you can just change the way you like but most of the time whatever you do supply chain manufacturing or any kind of execution even marketing you need to plan your your marketing campaign in advance you have a lead time okay and that's why you need to define the ideally time for that the problem is you have too many items so maybe and the the solution will be use the average play time for all your item because if you have 10 or 20 different lead time is going to be very very complex to track all of this so what I recommend is or you use the overall Supply lead time for the item for example you have a two monthly time so you're going to do always two months in advance or what you can do as well because it's very complex is you keep it very simple and you just strike your accuracy one month before why one month before because this is the easiest way to track and most of the company are doing like this and you yes this is not perfect but I can tell you from my own experience if you are not good one month before you won't be good 3 months before and 6 months before and there is a strong correlation between the 3 months and 6 months and the one month before so if you improve the one month before you will definitely also improve the three and six months and it's going to be much easier to explain much easier to track in your system and much easier in overall especially if you never track forecast before if you already have a system that track this for you for example I had a company in Australia and we were tracking one month before two months before and three months before and uh we had goals for the three but my uh bonus was only for the one month because it was easier even if my Supply CH lead time was two to three months okay so that was just an explanation the ideal is Supply chly time the recommendation is keep it simple one month before whatever you do weekly or monthly forecast for the weekly you can do the week before or you can do the week before the months before to have always like four weeks in advance so that's my recommendation and now we're going to track the forecast in Excel
in this episode I'm going to tell you how to save your forast because you cannot track your forus if you don't save your forus history so if you go back to my file we do have accuracy and forus history and the idea is like okay most of the company they don't first they don't have forecast and second they don't even save the forecast in the past so they cannot really track what's happening so I'm going to give you first like very simple straightforward methods and then I'm going to give you more ad with powerquery method in the next episode but you can very keep it simple at the beginning you have your forecast and what you can do is the classic way you have your fight forecasting exper with your company and every month or every week if you forast every week you do you save your forecast and you save your forecast and you rename it maybe um I don't know like September 24 and you have you save your forecast not only for the the quantity the good thing is like yes you will have all Theory but also you will have all the commments and all the manipulation and parameters you are using at this time so I think if whatever you are doing like manual automatic it's always good to keep a version of it the other opportunity is maybe you already have a system you just have to upload the forecast and this is if you have an Erp you probably upload this forecast into an Erp system and if this is the case the system will probably save the the focus so this is even better but if you work on Excel or if even you work with Excel and an IP system I will always do a like having a backup of this file every month so every week uh then you you already know what what's happening and if you did a mistake you can go back to the file also many um many companies they have like automatic drive and you can for example I'm using a Google drive or you can use the same with Microsoft you have an his like history version of your file so if you forget to do it in the past you can go back to the previous version of it uh using your your drive you can talk to it and they can give you the the previous version of the file uh if you forget to do it before okay so that's two possibility the last one is the one I'm going to do first manually and then automatically is uh you need to save this information so what I did I did a tab called forecast history and in this tab I just copy and paste all the catalog don't forget to copy and paste all the new products if they are forecast and then I just copy one column per you can see there is one colum per month and you just copy and paste manually make sure you are in the same order so for example I'm going to do it for that make sure you use the for example the you have the same number of code and in the same order and then when you're here you're going to pass for example we're going to go back to forast Orizon 1 month so we're going to take the forast one month before so this is the m plus zero before the end of the month and what you going to do I don't have the new products yet oh you can copy the new products and you going go back to your forecast history copy and paste like this and you have your forecast and then you can just type what was the code 81 223 boom okay so now you have your forecast and then you're going to save like this every month and then you going you're going to cons idate uh you need to type because it's a t make sure it's a table format it's going to be easier you have to do like this I think well like this and then you can paste you can paste like this up forus history you have your forast like this or what you can do as well you can have a video cup automatically that's so I have a video cup to copy and pass every month and every month you can just do like this and copy and P because maybe you won't have the same order you will have maybe new product so you want to make sure you just copy and paste every month this will always get you the latest month uh that you want to copy and if you have a two months of raason you can change this to another you are not copying this one but this one to have the plus two months in your forecast Horizon I was explaining before okay so that was the manual way and then uh once you save your forecast you can go back to tracking your accuracy we've done that when we're testing the forecast um in the in the pisode when we're testing and optimizing the model we can go back to the same principle with the same formula I'm going to get back to this but keep in mind you need to have a saving forecasting process to make sure you can track the accuracy and then having pass result then you can analyze and optimize your performance
okay so now this is not a mandatory episode this is an episode which will be much more advanced so if you feel it's already too much for you you can just skip the video below but for the one who want to go deeper uh we have a we this is a good start to save your forast but this is an horizontal format and it's it's better to dep pivot to have it in a vertical format like we did for the sales before this is like for example this is an horizontal but you you're going to use vertical form to create pivot table automatically you're going to understand later okay so what we did before you still need to have the process to get your information every for example every month once a month you have a reminder or you C you copy just the colum with all the codes and you do like this and you copy and paste the value and you have this into your file and then what you have to do I'm going to remove because this is not the month is not finished yet what you will have to do is to transfer from this into a table that you can manage automatically I'm I'm going to use powerquery for that so if you go back to data quism connection you can see there is a focus history and a focus accuracy and we will do all the calculation that we did manually before so if you don't know what I'm talking about go back to the the episode where I was checking in optimizing your model testing and optimizing different model I was calculating the forecast accuracy just by copying and paste all my codes for different months and I was comparing my sales and my forus to have my error and then I did a pivot table to calculate my accuracy per perimeter this is good for one or two months but if you want to track many many months like this one if you want to go back to having this kind of accuracy for the last for example two years it's going to be a lot of work because going to be a lot of colums okay so we want to do it more in a more efficient way and that's what we're going to do now so to do that you go back to your forus history very important that you have this is a table this is a table format table design format and what we're going to do I'm going to do it again for you like in a quick quick way so you will have to go back to my file if you want to go deeper you go to data get data from file not from file from other source table and ren okay so you can use for event to so you could do this in separate file if your file is already too big but you can even quick and get table from the same file so now you have your table focus hisory and what we're going to do now is very simple we're going to unpivot you remember because we have one colum per date from 2021 which is lot of column and you cannot do a pivot table from that so like before we're going to select this from from this we're going to hold shift the shift button and then we're going to go to transform not yeah an unpivot colum and the other colums not the column we selected the other columns boom and know we do have the date the attribute is the date make sure you have the date format make sure if you don't have a date format like I explained before make sure this is a US format so you if you are not in the US make sure like if you don't have a right display of the date use the always use English United States format even if you're not in the US otherwise you not going to get get what is that to date and English United States okay perfect so this is the local one I'm going to keep this one I'm going to rename it date and my value is called forast and you can call it one month because it's one month before for example okay so we have this this is great and know if you want to track the accuracy or you can upload this this tab directly you can CL and load and you already have a non pivot table and you can calculate your forecast accuracy close and L let's do it just to see the way it looks T so now we have we have the same table than this one but it's unpivot then you can really in a more efficient way calculate your accuracy you can V look up here the same sales you V look up the Sals for the same period and then you calculate manually the forecast accuracy but you can do it even faster with P query then you don't have the look up and your file will be much faster so let's go back to por query and this time we're going to merge the cells and the forecast history so what we're going to do we're going to go to mesh queries mesh queries as a new I want to create a new one and we're going to select the sales and the forecast History 2 the one I just created where is your link you have the link of the item code and the date you need to press control and select two and we do the same for this one ta okay so we have uh we have good match no no problem press okay and now we have in the same time with with no V lookup once one more time and what we're going to do we're going to select only the one we like so the forecast I don't use the original color name as a prefix T perfect so now we have all of this of course we don't have for every single code we don't have since 2019 but this is not important and know what we want to do is if you look at my so if you want all the details you can call this one forast uh accuracy 2 like this if you really want to have all the details I did a lot of steps so basically I rename I rename the columns and I calculated what we call the absolute error the error in in dollars and I did what I did in Excel I did it directly for then I don't have any calculation it's going to be much faster much easier to calculate my forecast accuracy later so you can if you want if you are curious you can for example go back to all the the steps and you can see for example if you want the absolute value it's number that ABS this is this is a language called the M language this is very similar to excel but you just need to know this specific Formula One for absolute error this is yes this is more advanced but at at the end we would be more efficient so I just wanted to show that to you so you have all the steps I did you can go step by step to understand what what I did before if you understand po query if this is too complex for you you can maybe one day follow my other Excel course so now I'm going to go just to give you for example we're going to for example calculate the error between the forecast and the sales I did only the forast in quantity I think so we're going to do it only in quantity Okay so so we're going to do insert at colon from example or you can do even like this we're going to do this and let's do like let's try to do like this substract let's double check where is the subraction TU T tck yeah I'm not sure about this one so let's do it manually custom Colum and we're going to call it error quantity and we're going to do forecast oh I don't see okay interesting minus say Quantity I don't know what's happening with my display and let's press okay so now you can see this is my forast and this is my sales quantity so my error was minus 18 for this one for this one it was plus 6 now what we're going to do we're going to create the absolute error so I'm going to go back to custom colum absolute error quantity and I'm going to use my number I don't know why my screen doesn't display this time it's interesting okay maybe I'm going to close this on open again yes first time I have this problem I'm not going to cut this keep let's try again okay t t let's add another colon add colon custom colon so absolute error quantity okay know it's working and so you just need to know it's number that apps and I want I want I want the absolute error of this press okay and know as you can see all the negative value are becoming positive so it was like in Excel the absolute value but in in two power query and then for example I want to have the value of my absolute error what I'm going to do I'm going to do another custom colum I'm going to call it absolute error dollar and I'm going to do the price times the absolute error quantity clack and know I do have my absolute error in in value and we can do all of this and at the end you can follow all my step it's cleaner here you have up in forus accur tab I did my error quantity absolute error quantity error dollar absolute error dollar and then I have my sales in dollar and with all of this we will be able to calculate the forast accuracy if you are curious about this tab you can just close and load T tac tac so this is this Focus accuracy tab we can do right click load two worksheet no I'm not going to remove this one because I already have one but at end we will be able in the next episode to have this tab and we're going to create all this pivot table so that was just a quick introduction for that it's it's very similar to the forecast accuracy too now that you have this table we will be able to calculate the forecast accuracy and we'll be able to uh make sure that we uh we have something very automatic and that's why I use por query for that and if you if you think it's too much you can just do the classic way like I did before and we're going to do keep calculating the accuracy in the next episode
okay so now we have a table with all the forecast accuracy information like we did before for tests and results but now we can do it directly with P query if you use P query you can also practice with me one more time and if it's too much with SP query you can do the classic way or or you can just use like the the very basic option 3 months 6 months if you think this is way way too complex for you at the beginning but at the end you need to have a process to calculate and what we're going to do now we're going to create all this analysis for forecast accuracy so let's go back to insert pivot table oh we need to leave my pivot table from external data source choose a connection you're going to use forecast accuracy open I didn't create the kpis yet only the the information for the KPS let's go to a new worksheet and know let's go to the category I'm going to do only the the accuracy in in value because I prefer to calculate in value per it time you won't change anything but when you're going to consolidate it's going to be important to check in value so you have the error and you have the sales T Tac and what I want to know now I want to have the accuracy okay also you have the absolute errow absolute great so I need to do all this Division if you want want to have the accuracy you will have to divide the absolute by the sales and if you want to have the Bas you will have to divide this one by this one so I did that before I'm going to do it quickly one more time only for the value we're going to go to the pivot table and calculate Fields okay so this this could come from powerquery or just a normal table but you need to have the same structure of the table okay so let's call it accuracy dollar and let's call it T tac tac so I already have my previous kpi let's do it with absolute eror divided by sales and it's one minus if you don't do one minus it's going to be the error not the accuracy so add and then we're going to do the Bas and the Bas is simply the arrow divided by the cells wait BS BS okay okay we have this perfect T ta so now we have oh I'm going to switch you do colon by colon like this separately okay so now we have this accuracy the really cool stuff is now you have it for it's very very Dynamic so if you want to go for example by subcategory while my subcategory boom it's like this the problem of this accuracy is say great I have an accuracy of 45 which is not very good to be honest and my BS is 18 so I'm over fusing by 80% by average but the thing is like I want to have a specific date so what you can do you can add a specific range say I want only want to see 2023 oh it's better and I'm only over focusing by 4% or you could do like this you could say I want to see per year so now you can see the forecasting accuracy per year okay you don't really need to see all this information right as well so what you can do you can maybe copy and paste this one you can do another analysis maybe with this one only per year and I'm going to remove the sum of eror like this and I'm going to move this one like this up then you can see the evolution of the year you have for the accuracy and for the Bas what you can do as well you can um what I did in this one so we're going to do the graph later we can check the Su yeah we're going to do the the sum of the you going to see the absolute error as well so I'm going to do like this TCH and I'm going to filter by because at the end what is important is not only is what is important is the total absolute error so when you look at this at the end it doesn't really matter you going to do like this it doesn't really matter like the BX okay for example this one you have U the accuracy of this one is only 52 accessories but you have much much more impact with mon bike or even electric bike because the sum of the error is much more important so we're going to talk about it later how to analyze uh your forecast but it's not only about the percentage it's also about the weight of every category and you should always focus on the biggest value before even focus focusing on category let's for example focus on the sub category to see if we have a big difference I'm going to remove the total from this select cell T tac tac I'm not going to select the total and do it again so you can see for example that okay my uh locks only have 37% of accuracy but the total error is only 61,000 okay so at the end this is not very important what is very important is for example my mountain bike 2.6 millions of absolute error so I should when you do this analysis per category and subcategory don't only focus on the percentage because this this is very this is very small categories in sales but also in error focus as well on the absolute error totally and you have much room much more room to improve here because if you improve this one by 10% you will uh you will uh reduce the error by 200 6 69,000 and to have the same result you will have to improve by 100% all your small categories okay so that was just a quick analysis and what we're going to do in the next episode we're going to create this kind of graph that can be very very useful uh to uh to analyze your performance not only for the current months but for the last X years of History
okay so now in this episode we're going to do shot of your forecast accuracy it's very simple we're going to go back to this one we're going to copy and and paste CL what do we want to do we don't want to have the category maybe you can leave it like this and we want to have the date date click so you don't want the year you don't want the quarter you don't want the months you have this and then you do insert like this and we have this beautiful shot congratulation try to do it with me if you cannot do it pause the video and now we have this okay so we have this side which can be very very useful to understand what's happening nice and what we can do now we can also change the axis to you have the accuracy and you have the BS this is the BS should be close to zero and the accuracy should be as close as possible 100% so let's change the shot select data I'm going to change my this shot as yeah no I'm going to do like this right click change chart type we're going to go to combo and we're going to go to the BS will be secondary axis and the accuracy is going to be like this and line like this so line and cols now what you can see which is very interesting is like the accuracy in 2020 end of 21 was a disaster they and you can see the BS was very high so they over focus a lot and it was the the case for most of the bicycle industry and they didn't see the the after the pandemic they St a lot of project and then they over and and over forus and at the end the accuracy was even less than zero which was a disaster which created a lot of over stock and you can see that in the BS and the accuracy so this is very very cool graph we can also change this one here from the I'm going to do this as like this I like this one and once you have this analysis you can display this you can show that to your board of director you can also change if you like the if you only want to specific like for one year what you can do you can insert a a timeline to insert a timeline like this CL I know you can even select for specific months or here you can go to for example yeah you say you know what I only want to see 2023 there we go or 23 and 22 there we go or you want per quarter there we go so this is pretty cool and if you want to learn more about dashboard I have a program called SM analytics and we go much much deeper into that you can also connect your report connection to different pivot table if you want to um also change not only this one but the other one so this is more advanced and this is the topic of my other course called SM analytics but have a look this is pretty cool I've um just to create this kind of chart that you can display in your in your reporting in your PowerPoint when you present this uh to your board of director and management team okay I did another one just per product if you want to have a a sharper product as well you can do um for example what I did for this one electric bike yeah you can do it by by category as well so you just have to copy and paste this or you can just do like this yeah I don't think you need to keep it very complex you want to see electric bike this is electric bike you want to see closing this is the closing really bad very very bad if you want to see broad bike okay rooad bike is close to the the average so I think that's it for the um the graph analysis have a look play with these numbers and in the next episode we're going to connect this accuracy to the base file
in this episode we're going to connect the accuracy into the base file because it's good to have all information into one place so what we're going to do we're going to go back to this this tab here and we're going to copy copy this tab so you copy and paste your pivot table we're going to remove the conditional formatting because it's going to be too much too much calculation for the file so clear from selected celles and I'm going to remove date and I just want to see the item code I have my item code I have my accuracy in percentage I have my BS Bas and I want to include as well my absolute error my sum of absolute error and my error as well so now you have all this information you remove the filter you put to all I know there is a question is what is the the period you wants to track in your file so you have you have this accuracy but you cannot display all the accuracy for every single month or every single week if you work work by week so the question is what will be the most accurate accuracy you want to show in this file for me I will all use the current year or I will use for example the the last three or four months if you work per months or if you work per week I will use maybe the last three or four weeks or even 10 weeks the idea is to have something which is quite relevant for the shortterm then you can review your forecast so this is not there is not like a clear answer for that you need to see if you really want to see what happened last month or if you want to have an overall result of the accuracy this year uh this is this is your call basically so if you go back to this uh you can add a filter on the on the date or you can in include another timeline of the dates and you can decide okay I want to have only 2023 or per months and you can have this selector and the selector will decide what is your what is your selection for you don't have anything because you're in August you could say oh I only want to have July T Tech you could only and then you're going to Simply V up this information into your file base okay so that's what you have to do in accuracy you have a vup if eror so if you don't have any accuracy you you put zero vup item come accuracy you're going to get from this tab so I just did a vup here T and I'm getting my accuracy percentage my absolute eror and my error and you just V up this into this tab and you have this three information 1 2 3 and then you can add another conditional formatting for low and high values uh this is another one if if your file is too slow you don't need to include this one but you can manage my rules and this is the colon n n m or n n n so this is the one and you can decide I decide I Define manual for 0.5 and 0.7 and this is your conditional formatting so once you have that you have this and you have this you have all the information you need to track your accuracy in a very very efficient way and then I'm going to teach you after that after including the uh XYZ analysis or to analyze all this information but very quickly you can already see in this graph what's happening for the good ones for the bad ones and also you can track in value I can tell you the value the value is very important when you have an absolute error of 319 is much more ,000 is much more important than the very small one $400 so you really need to focus your energy on the biggest value not only in percentage but in value and that's what we're going to see after
okay so now my friend let's talk about ABC XYZ analysis before going back to forecast analysis or to track your forecast accuracy uh this is a quick introduction you probably already know this uh topic if you follow me for a while on YouTube and on my specific Inventory management course but just to give you a quick update we were talking about the ABC analysis to really focus on the biggest volume in value but this is not good enough and that's why we are moving to the ABC XY Z we are going we're are switching from three categories to nine categories why because the ABC analysis is not good enough and the classic mistakes this is this is a very connected topic to inventory management but I want to do open this door for you the classic mistake is to spend for example too much time and uh and especially Safety stock stock coverage for example you say oh I have a top seller a so I'm going to put more stock coverage on my a code and my C codes or you will do the opposite you will say you know what CU I'm selling a lot of products they are more predictable though I'm going to have le less safety stock than on the slow seller because they are not predictable they don't sell a lot so I need to have more safety stock and also in terms of forecast you could say oh you know what I should spend more time on my C C because they're more difficult to predict okay and so that's really the classic mistakes I can see in the many companies I was working but at the end what is missing is the topic of demand and certainty and you have very predictable product like the consum consumption of toilet paper if there is no pandemic or French bagget in France and you have less predictable topic and product not toing but product like for example umbrella you don't know when it's going to rain I show this example multiple times so instead of only having ABC you will have also XY Z based on the level of uncertainty and for example for a product you will have I volume stable and you have ey volume very fluctuating or very with a big uncertainty so you'll have this combination of different categories between the volumes and the level of uncertainty you can do the volume in value in profit in quantity if you want to know more about it uh you can check my my other course so at the end you can also Target different level of service if the product is very stable and predictable you will have a better service and also you'll have a better focus accuracy these two are very connected that's why I wanted to talk about it and if you have a like very low volume and very unpredictable it's going to be more difficult to to forecast and most of the time maybe if the product is not profitable you don't want to have a high Safety stock so the conclusion of this is like yes it's better to go deeper into more categories it can become more complex and why only n you could go to 36 or you can even go to infinite categories that's what we're going to see but the more you will have categories the more it will be complex the more you will have different strategies and if it's too complex for you and your team at one point is going to crash and um that's why I was doing we're going to talk about it with machine learning as well I recommend to always keep it simple and if this principle is new for you keep it simple go first to ABC if you feel ready go to ABC XY Z but don't go too fast to too soon to this C to this complexity on LinkedIn I see many people to say oh ABC is too simple ABC why is not enough but I can tell you it's a very good ped peda peda like training tool or ped pedagogical tool for your team to make sure that they understand that there is different group of product with different level of volumes and uncertainty and if you want to go further I invite you to join my other course called Inventory management expert but now we're going to go back to Excel and I'm going to explain to you how to classify these products to improve the way you track your accuracy
okay my friends so now let's talk about the XY Z analysis you can see you have this colum called XY Z and you have also d uh D4 like product with no accuracy and now you have two ways to calculate the for the not the focus accuracy but the XY Z analysis I explained that in my other course Inventory management the first way the classic way is to use what we call the the standard deviation the variation of your product so for example if I go I go back to my level tab you have the skew you have the standard deviation and I'm taking the standard deviation of my last 24 months I recommend to have at least if possible one or two years history and then you're going to calculate the percentage of variation and the variation is what is the standard deviation of your the period divided by the average of your values okay so by doing this you will have the highest is the the higher is the variation the higher is the the vola of your product so you could consider that if it's 101% is more volatile than this one so let's take an example I'm going to take this one and see the way it looks oops what's happening here so this one is very uh you have a lot of variation and also a lot of other stock and now let's take a more stable one the 38% this one T 38% SK dashboard and this one is very stable as you can see there is only a big Peck here but then it's very very stable okay so that's a very good example okay so this one it looks like is more predictable except for this peak it's very stable so now what we're going to do in this level tab you're going to get this information and you could add a formula in your base here so you have another if you open this one you have the the same percentage of variation you could say you know what if I'm going to just do the beginning for you if my variation is less than for example I'm going to use 0.5 just as an example then it's X if my variation is less than one so one is 100% then it's a y and if if not this is a zed okay so that's there is a missing I need to be finish finish okay I need to close all my if wait if dead if 0.5 x if okay so now I have an automatic classification based on these parameters you're going to ask me why do I using 0.5 or one basically to know that you can do a p pivot table and for me you do it by by experience because I have a lot of experience and also by a result so you're going to do a pivot table from table and range I'm going to go back to ABC XY Z and you're going to calculate you're going to see how many products part of this category so I'm going to do like this going to put the same table here right oh I need to do it again I'm going to do it from table and Ranch from my base existing worksheet ta okay and you're going to just calculate how many XY Z are available T item code you're going to count and you're going to do it another time and this time you're going to go to Value setting going to show value as of the colum total and then you have the automatic percentage distribution we're going to remove the D1 because this is discontin the codes and now we have this number okay we have this number and you can see like you have okay 133% of I'm going to do like this 14% of X 36% of Y and the rest is 50% which is which is a repetition that makes sense for me so I'm going to use that I like to be not close to the the same like 2080 rules with ABC but if you have zero product with X you need to change the value you need to increase the the 50% variation to maybe 70 and if you have too many if you have 80% of your cod as X it doesn't make sense so the at the end the idea is really to focus your time and energy on group of products and you most of the time you have less stable products than unstable products so play with this number to adjust the percentage of variation so that was one example I could give to you I'm going to do contrl Z contrl Z contrl Z again the second one I can recommend to you is because the problem of this uh technique is for example exle you can have a product with variation because they are very predictable it's just because of the seasonality so let's go back to the subcategory for example winter winter closing CL and we're going to do for example this one for example when you see this product there is a high level of variation but this variation is predictable right this is just the winter peck so when you look at it with my simple rule you can see this product the percentage of variation is 86% but when I look at it is like you know it looks normal it looks predictable right so that's why I recommend you if you already have the forecast accuracy not to use the percentage of variation not this one so we're going to close it but you use instead the forecast accuracy and you can see that this product has a 79% of accuracy so it's this prod is very predictable so maybe it should not be as like a z code but maybe a y or even X code because it's more predictable so what I recommend to you is if you have this information is to use the accuracy as a tool to classify the level of uncertainty in three categories if you have no accuracy this is a d because you you cannot use it and if your accuracy is more than you can open this one if your accuracy so this is my category if your accuracy is more than 60% then I'm going to go to x I'm going to go to here we go if my accuracy is more than 80% then that's a x product if my accuracy is more than 60 then it's a y otherwise this is a z product this is my my rule how do I Define 60 and 80 one more time the 60 is close to my average this year so if you look at my forecast accuracy history you can see that in 2023 I at I at 53 but if you look at the last the last few uh few months I'm around 56% so what I like to do for my y I like I like to to to have it close to my average so that that's why I'm using 60 you could use 55 if you want you will have a different repetition and for the 80% I use it by experience and also by result and when I look at this repartition I can see that I'm going to refresh this I have 14% of my code X and for my y I have 36 and then 50% for this one so let's change the value to C I'm going to go to maybe 70 and 50 let's refresh and now you can see I have 30% of uh oh my X are here 35% of X Y 30% and 36 and to be honest my goal is really to go to improve this company accuracy and to go to towards 60 70% of accuracy so and ref Focus my time energy and for me makes more sense to be more demanding with this category of product and this one as well so I'm going to go back to 80 and 60 and then I I I feel that this kind of repetition is interesting for me there is less X than there is y and then do you have a lot of produce with Z classification okay so now we have this we have this automatic classification for the the one discontinued with no accuracy no problem we put it as a d and in the next episode I'm going to tell you how to deal with all this cap eyes all this information but just to let you know for the one we were tracking before you see this one now you also have very seasonal product with a lot of with a um with a like considering the seasonality but with a very good accuracy and if I look this one which this one is terrible this one is very not predictable you can see you have a huge Peak like this um because yeah I don't know exactly what happened for this one so this one was not great oh at least this peak was not predictable let's check another one this one yeah this one as well with a big boom in the in between and the more you will have all of stock as well the more it will be difficult for that so if you want to know more about this technology and classification you can check my course Inventory management and I see you for another episode
okay so now I'm going to show you how I analyze my focus accuracy we have all the information it took it took me a lot of time to explain to you okay what you what you supposed to set up between ABC XY Z accuracy error but at the end you have to do it only once and then everything is automatic and now you have to focus on your analysis oh let's say you are on Monday you just refresh this file by pressing refresh all what you going to look at first first thing you can maybe double check the accuracy the selection of your accuracy which months did you take so you took 2023 for this one and you took the last four months I think this is this is quite relevant you could if you really want to focus on the short time you can maybe remove one and focus on this one okay let's do let's do for mons then you go back to your file and what what you going to see first first what you can do maybe only focus on your A and B code right even maybe just the aod this is your most important product in your company you can see that this product you can just have a quick glance on the the accuracy of it you can see oh you have very good one the green one I'm not going I'm not very concerned about the green one but you have the the red one for example you can maybe focus on the red very red one you say okay let's have a look on this one so this one the accuracy in the P was really bad because we had a SP we had a recent launch and for this specific one you have to make sure that you are very confident for the future and what we did in the future it's like you know what when you look at the sale you had a massive sale at the beginning and then it looks like it's more stable so we're going to use the average sales of the last three months so I explained this before but we switched from 12 months to 3 months because we were over forecasting we were over fusing because of the launch so now if when you look at of the forecast it looks like it looks like it's okay already it's under control because I already have a command so I will always focus on my a code and make sure that for all the low value there is something happening I didn't check this one so let's have a look at this one so this one it looks like it's um the accuracy was not great we had a drop here that we maybe we didn't forecast it doesn't look crazy we have a peak of the end of the month so I'm not very concerned for the rest maybe it's a bit too high based on the the curve but don't forget there is a seasonality as well so maybe for this one I can maybe reduce a bit the trend if I feel this is too much so you can override the forecast or you can just say you know what I'm going to reduce a bit the trend it should be 23% but I'm going to switch to 10% or forecast there is anot for that and if I go back to my dashboard I'm going to reduce a bit to make sure we are on track okay so that's just one example I like to focus on a then I'm going to focus on my b card you can also do an automatic filter to say I want a filter only less than 0.5 and then you have only the really the ugly ones okay so that's the way I'm going to focus first on the most important A and B codes the second thing I'm going to go it could be even the first step you can directly focus on the biggest error absolute or not so you could do like this go to largest to smallest you remove the blank one I don't know why is this one yeah this one clack and now you have the biggest error ever whatever the classification is a b whatever the accuracy because some sometimes this one is for example 50% of accuracy but this is a really bad this is a z zero one 0.5 million doar of error and this see we underestimated the forecast most of the time so you have if you really don't have time you don't even you don't even have to check the a BC or Z category this will really help you to inform you this is for me an a red flag to say okay with this color my brain will know oh I need to be very careful with this one but at the end the most simple one is the total error and you have 0.5 million here 0.1 M 0.5 million here and this one is like 10 10 times less important it's only 50k of error so let's have a look at this one and in this one the problem is we didn't forecast the peak and it was a comp kid cell it was a they did 6,000 units for kid camp in in the in America and at the end he was not in the forecast so the Mist is too late now it looks like the forecast is back to normal again so I I think it was just a oneof mistake but next time make sure that you override the forecast you say oh the the next there is another keep like big order coming uh in 12 months so you need to plan this to override the forecast okay so you have a lot of information like this and if you don't have information maybe you should maybe check what's going on but always start with the biggest error to make sure you have fastest results and I was always the way I was working I was always focusing on the most important and if you have all this information especially this one you you it's going to be much easier for you to have faster result because this have much more important on your accuracy than the very very small one here this one for example you could say oh this one has minus 54% of accuracy but the total error is only $200 so don't waste your time don't waste your time with this product this is not important this is not relevant at the end of forecast is close to 2 3 52 this is nothing and the average price is $40 plus so there is no at the end you're going to use a safety stock and the minimum mod of quantity will just erase all your accuracy problem you you'll probably have over stop because of the mq so only focus on the one with biggest yeah bigest accuracy this one has also probably a sales like exceptional sale which was not normal and so I would definitely go to marketing to make sure okay or sales to say what in the past and make sure you have an information to avoid this we automatically clean with our system but it was not enough and it was not plan in the system one more time that's why when you see all this mistake that's why also the accuracy is really bad not really bad it's like close to 55 or 56 because in the past this company never plan and forecast this exceptional cells and these exceptional cells have the huge impact on the accuracy if we remove all these products with like exceptional huge orders I think the accuracy will be much closer to 65% than 55 today okay so that's the way I work I go ABC I go biggest value you can also go or absolute or maybe if you have a you are very concerned you tend to have Overstock maybe you can maybe focus on this one on the the biggest error positive and if you look at this product you can see that we were talking about this product before you can see that we have uh the we were over foring why because we were out of stock and you can see there is an issue with the supplier and it's going to be back in November so when we look at this product on purpose because we're over focusing due to out of stock they override the forus and they say the stock will be back in November so they override the focus and say we're going to sell a lot in November and and then we're going to go back to normal so that is the new forecast and hopefully it's going to work and this time we are not going to over over forast the produ because this product won't be available okay so I hope this is good example at the end keep it simple track the overall history to see if you have you are getting better and then every single week every single month you go back to this file you always go back to the biggest value biggest error and you try to understand what's happening you improve your model if necessary you override the forecast you have multiple way you include commments and by doing this every single week every single month you will improve and you will get better and you will uh get stronger to improve your accuracy and the performance of your company
okay so great now we did the micro analysis product by product which is very efficient if you focus on the biggest error in value now we need to consolidate we need to connect the dots with the macro forecast the financial forecast to see if we have any gap between all the forast by product and the overall forecast and for that I have this for you this is a pretty cool uh so you can open this like this click and what do we have we have the this file that will really help you to understand what is the difference between my macro and the end of the year if I'm close to the Target or not so let's go to this let's select Global and by showing that you will see my Global forecast you you have last year the blue one is last year you have this year the the results of the sales and this red one is the sum of all your forast in in by product so at the End by doing this you can see plus 6% so my growth forecast for this year is to grow by 5.6% and the question is what what was the target from Finance so let's go back to finance and if you go back to finance you can see oh yes my focus was to do 45 Millions just to let you know we also included the flying bike category which was not in the introduction Financial forecasting chapter so make sure you use the latest file that you can download in the the ABC analysis episode so you can see that we are very close to the target the target now is to grow by 6.9% this is all the category and we are growing by 6% 5.6 exactly so we are pretty close which is a good sign sometimes when I I joined a company we were like 20% different between the sum of all my products and the financial forecast and my goal was to close the gap and that's what we're going to do in the next episode so to do to have this kind of analysis and and table as well first of all we need to consolidate data you need to consolidate the all the sum of all your forecast and compare with your financial forecast so to do that or you do it automatically and you have a system for that and if you don't have system I'm going to give you an introduction of what could be a way for you this is quite Advanced as well because you need a lot of Excel and you can Tex to be a few days even weeks to consolidate that if you don't have the right structure but you can follow my example and try to find your own way to uh improve your your consolidation and to analyze the Gap so the first step is to have and we've done that before the value of your forecast because we when we talk about Target most of the time it's in value it could be sales for like value like sales price it could be a if you are in the manufacturing it could be like cost of goods price purchase price and then you just need to use the same valuation for your your financial forecast than for your product forecast so you have this forecast value and then what we're going to do we're going to consolidate we're going to consolidate the value of this forecast get the past sales and having an overall dashboard so how to do that I'm going to do just the beginning for you first we're going to get the P sales then this is the forecast You Know M plus Z M plus one and you need to have these two blocks and to consolidate so I'm going to go back to I'm going to create another tab if you feel this is too much this is not mandatory but this is just for your information the most important one is to understand the analysis behind and then you can find your own way to analyze the Gap so we're going to just insert a pivot table from external data source we're going to use sales [Music] uh not valid okay sales what's happening I'm going to refresh first t t tck sometimes it's happening so insert pivot table from data source you see sometime yeah because I I did a pause in my recording though so I to refresh again so we need to see the sales we want to see the dates you don't want the year yeah the fter is the year and we're going to it's like we did for the level of the product you don't want the item code you want the category and the sub category up we have all of this and then what do we want we want to we don't need all the year we want to focus on the last few years only so I'm going to take only this once because I want to calculate the growth but I don't want to have from 2018 for example so now we have all of this and we have the next months accessories t t t perfect I just need to have the total accessories total T and you're going to do repeat all item label okay uh no this is not table of form yeah something like this so you do something like this and then we're going to do the same this is the pass sales and then we're going to do the sales for the the forecast so we're going to do inserts we're going to go back to my base insert pivot table from table Ranch this time I'm going to use all my base existing worksheet make sure you leave some space if you have more categories coming okay and you do the same category sub category and this time we're going to add all the forecast in value so you go to the end this one this one this one this one so I have all my for this is my forecast and this is my sales okay this is all in US Dollars okay so we have all of this we even have the flying bike forecast and now I'm going to go back to my dashboard this is I did the same so you can just double check the the way I did but this is the same principle make sure you have the same name to to do the vup and after that I want to create this tab who will consolidate both the forecast and the sales for that you have you you have to copy and paste all the category make sure you have all of them even the new one called Flying bike and then before doing all this calculation you need to have the sales of last year and the sales and forecast of this year so for that this is your starting point you're going to start from the first the first month of last year and then here you have a you have a formula which can be scary if you never done that before but I told you it's called index match and I have two formula I have an if error this is Advanced but I just want to show you the example first I'm going to look at the sales so first of all this is like a superv c to say first I'm going to look at the Sal if I don't find sales for this specific months for this specific months then then I'm going to look at my forecast because all I have a sales or I have a forecast but I don't have both of both of um I don't have or I have the sales or I don't have the two in the same time right and to make sure I'm I'm in the right page I have the date here and for this one I'm going to connect this to my base to make sure that okay M plus 0 is August then it's September October November okay so I have my P sales I have my forecast and this formula will just get me all the sales if I have sales or if it's in the future from August 23 for this specific example is going to get me my forecast so let's try to get one for example for mountain bike men if I go back to for example uh September it's 740,000 mountain bike men you can see 740,000 for the month of September and there is no sales because the sales will stop in August okay and I'm not using the current month because the month is not complete so I have all of this that was a bit fast but just to give you an idea you can check my formula you don't have to use index match but at one point you need to have the category and you need to consolidate the sales and the forecast for the full year last year and this year and then we're going to do in the next episode we're going to calculate all the capis we need to see what's going on with the numbers and the gap
okay so now we have all this St with the forecast and the sales what we're going to do first we're going to analyze the growth to see what's happening so to do that it's very simple now we have all information I'm going to do first the sum of last year so the sum of in this specific case you see 2022 like you see I have a formula it's a year then when we change the the the file next year you don't have to update anything everything is automatic so I just do the sum of last year this is the 12 months and then I do the same for next year and the next year is a mix between the sales and from August this is the forecast okay from August this is the this is forecast so I have the 2023 forecast and I have the 2022 from this I can already calculate what is my gross so I can do the sum of all my categories and you can see that last did 42.6 million this year my total forecast is 45 million let me check if my formula is correct T tac tac perfect so I have all of this 45 Millions now what I'm going to do is like okay but what is the gross of of this and you you going to calculate what we call the fory grow projected so you can do it by category you're going to just divide this by this we have + 9% - 133% and for the total we have + 5.5% we're going to divide this by this minus one okay so once you have this it's a very interesting point you say okay my financial Target so here you have the the end of the target project with the all the forus of all your product but what was the initial Target and for this one I just did a v up of all the categories and the global and this video cup is coming from my target so I just did a video cup of this to this and I just got my 2023 Target by category and Global and my target Global including the flying bike keep in mind that the flying bike is a new category that we are working the new product category but it was interesting when we did the risk and opportunity forecast the flying back forecast was $600,000 at this time but when we look at the file the total forecast for this year flying B is $900,000 so we have a bit more in the forecast than in the risk opportunity when we did the financial forecast we're going to go back to this later at the end you have the 5.5 is my projected forecast and my sales Target is 6.9 so I'm below my Target and below my target there is a gap between this and this we're going to talk about it later but we are not pretty we're are pretty close which is a good sign and as you can see in the graph as well we are pretty close to the taret which is a very very good good sign the next step is to look at not only the project but what we call the year year to dat year to date is what is the what was the forecast since the beginning of the year without considering not not the forecast what was the sales growth since the beginning of this year without considering the forecast so what is the growth for the green part so the part we know there is no forecast included and for that we're going to use a formula that will only consider the year-to DAT value so we're going to use this formula and it's a samith that will say okay my current month is the month of August so the month of August is eight I'm getting it from the base I'm going just do the sum of 2022 just do the sum of 2022 for all the months less than eight so I'm going to do the sum of this so the sum is 4.5 million and when I see my number I have 4.5 million here so you can check my formula if you want okay I have a I have less to eight I did the same for 2023 so I do the sum of all of this less than eight so I can compare from the same period we did the same for the graph here is like comparing this period not the 22 with the 23 I compare these two to see what is a gross of the same period and then when you have the year-to date of 2223 you can calculate what is the year-to DAT growth and in this specific case for for example for mountain bike main we are growing by two we were growing since the beginning of this year by 2% this one minus 15% you see 3.3 million last year from the same period and then then 2.8% and overall you can see that the year today we did 25.8 million and this year we did 25.8 as well so we didn't grow our year to-day grow is 0% so when I see not this number I can see that okay great my year to-day grow is 5.5% but no sorry my yet today gross is 0% my my forecasting like my at theend by the end of this year I want to do plus 5.5 so it means that I we will have a very strong growth by the end of this year and that's what we're going to see in the shart after so this analysis is very interesting to see if you are off track or not for me there is an alert why because we are not growing as fast since the beginning of this year than the end of this year so we're are 0% since the beginning but we're going to accelerate by the end of this year maybe people are over optimistic maybe we are not going to sell as much maybe the fllying back won't happen and that's what we're going to see in the next episode but always try to have the projected and the year to date and compare these two versus the sales Target and that's a very very good start to understand what's going on in your company
okay so now the next episode is to talk about this graph so once again I feel that this is very useful to have a visual forecast projection by category for big one for subcategory for small category and yeah I'm going to give you a few advice for that I recommend to have a selector so for the selector this is not a mandatory video but I feel you should have this kind of tool I I didn't have this tool for a very long time so as a director it was very difficult for me to see what was happening and the the visualization are very powerful so for the the list just do the list of all your category like this and then you have a selector and then you're going to do a v look up of for example if I want to have this information I'm using once again index match of the mountain bike for the mon number one and I'm getting this from my this type for the sales and then for the for the forecast I'm doing this and I'm getting this from the forecast so you can look at my file and my formula the idea is really to give you IDs and the idea as well is to not to display on the chart if there is a basically if we're in the future for 2023 I'm going to use a formula that will use na what is na is to make sure that now I can to display with red is to make sure that the graph is not going to zero I explained that in previous episode before but at the end the idea is really to have a visual because we don't have any cells so I'm if my uh if you think like if this is equal to um to um the current months I don't want to have the current months because the months is not complete and for the next one there is no cells so it is going to be zero okay so that's the rules don't don't consider the current months of August because it's already is not completely yet it's not full the current months here you can see the total I have 5 million and then I have 2.9 because it's not complete so I have this formula for that and then after that I have zero so I don't display anything for the forecast I get all the forecast uh from um the the current tab that I have here and at the end I have all my information to create the chart I also calculate the gross I think it's also good visually to say okay what was my gross since the beginning of this year and what is my projected growth here and I'm going to calculate okay this is my gross from all the the item I have all the forecast for all the products and what you can see is you have a lot of orange and red and here you have very very strong grow you you Pro project to do plus 25 + 1+ 17 plus 22 which is very very ambitious when you see the beginning of this year and um the year to date for example for mountain bike is minus 5% and we plan to finish the year close to zero if you look at the global you can see we had a strong months in June July as well but now we we plan to do a very very strong one plus 38% in November what's happened in November we have the new flying bike happening and the flying bike will be in November with a very strong grow you can see $8,000 just for this category which is a lot okay so you can see that on the graph and if you look at for example flying bike boom you have this big peek so I really recommend you toy this kind of Vis visual to see what's going on I also did the total and the year to date one more time you can check the formula and I also just duplicated the same graph to see if you want for example to compare two in the same time you s oh I want to compare mountain bike men and women you just select that or you want to compare electric city bike and electric mountain bike and you can see oh the different Trend you can compare you can copy and paste this this this chart into your PowerPoint for your presentation when you do an SNP meeting you can start from this Gra graph analysis so this is very very useful so that's it for the graph the last thing is the title so you can see we have a dynamic title which is pretty cool as well when you change a global you can see you have a plus 6% Global which is very useful if you want to just copy and paste screenshot to your email hey this is a global situation you just click on the title and you can see that you have equal Global dashboard this and at the end you have this cell and this cell it's a bit this is very Advance expert level we at the end of the course now and I just did a concatenation of global and I did a cenation I'm going to show you if you do equal this and the result press five you will have something a bit ugly we will have Global 0.5 blah blah blah so what I did is I did a round up so I did um I did this I did a round wait let me check my formula I did a round up times 100 so I did equal round up this is very Advanced just for you round up of this times 100 zero so then I have this number I have six instead of 0.0 Z and then I did a concatenation of this of tech percent so now I have 6% and now I do like this I do Global and this and now I have Global 6% and you can even say this and you get plus this like this so now you have Global plus 6% boom okay so this is my formula and if there is an error then I add another topic but this is the main principle and also I say if this is positive I add the plus as well because sometimes negative so check my formula if you are curious that's it for the the graph analysis always next level it takes the extra few days to implement I of course it took me only 10 minutes for you but take some time at the end is going to be much easier for the the explanation and for your communication and for yourself if you have this kind of graph
okay so now we're going to talk about Gap analysis this is a very important topic especially if you are supply chain manager SN manager you are in finance and you want to understand what's going on in your company and everything we did before was to supply this information for you so we have all all of this we have uh the information for last year year to date and what is missing now is the gap you can see there is a gap here and what we're going to do the Gap we're going to compare the T Target versus the projected and see do we have big gap or not so before we did the year to-day grow versus the projected but let's have a look on this so this target as I explained before is coming from the financial Target that we did before and you want to see if you are you on the same page based on the strategy of your product of your category are you on the same page and that's the topic of snop and filling the Gap and most of my time I was my job was not it's impossible to be perfect but you have to make sure that you focus on the main Gap so what is the gap you can do it in percentage you just compare the sales Target versus the projected this is B SK and this is this is the bottom up you do the sum of all the forecast and this is the but the top down this is the financial forecast and then you do one minus the other one and you can check which one has the biggest one right for example main winter closing we have 41 % Gap this category is doing men winter closing let's have a look men winter closing it doesn't look crazy we're just doing a bit less than last year the forast looks very weak for the end of the year so maybe there is a risk for that but the trend for this year was really bad as well you can see like year today minus 48 totalus 41 it doesn't look crazy so looks like that the financial Target at the beginning of the here was very very overconfident so I will definitely change that and just for information I also get the trend of the last 12 months the trend of the last 12 months is just to give you an extra information maybe it's too much for you but just to let you know we did the trend analysis and the trend of the last 12 months show that the main winter closing based on this trend is doing minus 19% so you can go back to Trend as a chapter if you want to know more about this if you skip the episode before but at the end the trend for this specific one I will definitely not bet that we're going to reach the sales Target so I will probably readjust this if we are the the middle of the year so the the percentage analysis is very interesting some of them are very close some of them are completely out for example the phone older you can see that we the gross project is plus 37 yet to date minus 11% and the sales Target is Plus 100% so let's have a look on the graph that's why we have a graph for that the graph of Fone holders is okay more or less you're to date minus 11 because of July July was really bad minus 30% in July and then boom we have all of this why do we have this why because we force the forecast on this category so if you go back to the trend try this no this one I don't know if you remember but for for say yes the 12 month train is plus 5% but we have a strong ambition so we're going to force all the forecast to plus 100% and that's why we did and that's why in the forecast if you go to phone holder phone holder for all these products we have a new trend of plus 100% that means that we have a very very strong forecast for all the products and we don't have any seasonality we have a flat seasonal as we decided that's why in the global dashboard we have all the same value all flat and plus 100% because we plan to do a lot of marketing Activation so when you are in this meeting I'm going to show this cing guys is it still happening because the trend is really bad so that's the topic of Gap analysis in percentage but the most simple one is not in percentage it's in value so how do you do that you're going to compare what was the what was the forus what is the forus of this year versus the financial Target and this financial Target not in percentage but in value and this v c is just the value of your financial Target here you have the Target in percentage and the Target in value okay so I did it in value why because also you have new category with no no percentage and what is important for me more than per percentage is what are the main gaps so you do the difference between this and the financial Target if this is positive it's a good I mean you are over fusing versus the the forecast the financial Target if you this is negative you are you are late to reach your target once you do that you can first see the overall and the overall Global we are minus 1% does it mean we have half million late versus the the financial Target but when you look by category this is very interesting because at the end you don't really care about the phone holder the phone holder Gap is even if we are 63% this is only $10,000 late which is nothing so when you do Gap you always focus on the like the code before like we did when we're analyzing with products you don't care about the small one you don't have time for small ones you really need to focus on the biggest errors and we do the same for category and for Gap what is the B biggest one the biggest one is this one electric bike electric bike you can see that the electric mountain bike we have 18% Gap but in value is 0.7 million this is huge so you should really spend your meetings first to fill the gap of the big ones before focusing on the small and tiny ones so first what happened with electric mountain bike let's have a look so Electro M you can see that we're way below the target way below like the year to date is- 16 the the end of the forecast is minus 15 so when I see that it looks like that the financial forecast was wrong was unless there is a new product and this new product is not part of my base maybe there is a new product coming and um so what was the it was electric mountain bike electric mountain bike you have to make sure when you do this anal okay do we have a product missing I know you have all the information that would be my first question if you don't have any product missing do you have a promotion missing I don't see any I don't see any promotion plan I don't see any override there is a discontinu cut so for me like based on all this information for now I would say we are not going to reach the target for this electri mon B so maybe we have to review the financial Target and this is a big deal because we are losing $700,000 of sales so I'm I would definitely challenge this number plus two and I say you know what maybe this is minus 16 but if you do that we are not we have to review our Target if I change this number electric B time back to minus 16 my new Target is not plus 6.5 is 5.2% right so this can be only approved by the CFO and the CEO but now he oh we are pretty close congratulations but you have also other news that but what about the mountain back woman we have another Gap so you need to do this analysis first for the big one and make sure that okay do what is the problem is it from the product is it from marketing is it from sales is it from supply chain you need to have all of this another another last example is like okay flying bike great plus 300K but you remember before we have a high probability that the supply chain and production won't deliver this product and for this year this is almost $1 million and this is a big risk if we go back to the Target risk and opportunities new flying by connection 3 Millions but we have a low probability at the end we have a $600,000 what happen if nothing happen you can you can do this automatically you go to fly bike and you can or you can re you can change the quantity you can you can just shift this you can move it to here zero zero if you do that you go back to the dashboard you refresh your forecast and by doing that now you have zero in flyback for this year and now you have a $600,000 gap and now are in trouble because your your Global forecast t t t you see we the big Peck here and know this peak is gone so we only F we only growing by 3% when the new Target is 5% so the goal of this video and that was the conclusion of this topic was really once you have all this information you can really do this what we call top down bottom up analysis by having all this information and I will always focus on my main gap which is very very interesting for me so I hope you really enjoyed this that was just an introduction I could talk about analysis for years but I think this is a very good um ideas of the way I work the way I focus and the way I take and prioritize my decision and in the next chapters we're going to go deeper but we're going to also check with Amazon the way they work and the way they review their forecast
all right Mario so now let's talk about the forecasting review at Amazon how does it work between the system the the human of right can you explain us what is the what are the principle we talk about it before but I I would love to to go more into details sure so by default every item has a system forecast so a forecast generated by the machine okay this is very important and we call this the coverage okay okay so the entire ideally like 100% you need that 100% coverage meaning like 100% of the selection okay needs to be forecast need to have a forecast it might be zero like zero dot z0000 okay might be zero because bab we're just forecasting to sell known okay of a specific item but it has to be something cannot be null okay um then what happens is that you know if we we we let humans override the forecast okay sometimes okay the idea is yeah the idea we want tox maximize what we call the final forecast which is the machine plus after the human intervention okay we call the final forecast ideally we want the final forecast to be yeah higher than the system forecast okay it's extremely valuable so um what do we do so in general for my experience if we just let people override the forecast uh without any any any process anything um it they will I even even if we have a quite a simple forecasting system in general they will they will destroy the forecast okay they will destroy the accuracy they will lower the accuracy why is that for many many reasons but first and foremost I think the most important one is that people Mak changes and they forget about it yeah okay well the machine although it might be a super simple algorithm always keep take into account like the latest sales the latest data okay so and this is something a human especially if the selection is very large a human cannot do okay okay so um yeah so what the what's the main reason I think for U having um uh humans uh uh not improving the accuracy in general it's a conflict of interest okay conflict of interest yeah uh yeah because in general like humans maybe they they are um their career or their bonuses are indexed on you know their uh turnover growth yeah uh sales increase so they have the tendency to overes the forecast okay overestimate the forecast because um you know to have 100% availability and be sure they maximize their sales instead if you know they're Overstock in general they have very low consequences okay so they they they they do it this way so what we what we do for um uh balancing this uh or solving I think this conflict of interest is very simple basically we uh track the measure the accuracy of of every every intervention okay yeah and uh if there are humans that overall they decrease the accuracy of the system forecast they just lose their rights they cannot they cannot modify the forecast anymore okay to bad yeah yeah this is this is I think this is a this is a pretty uh um harsh uh um uh measure okay and uh of course you know users don't like it okay and that's why they they they immediately uh uh change their behavior when they see such a threat because it means that even in the extreme case we have I don't know the the hero product okay and you realize that the system forecast is not accurate and you really have to change it you cannot do it okay or it takes you so much time sorry is it is it the manager say your your forus is is bad so I'm I'm shoting you don't or the system is doing it like who take yeah so I automated this process okay the process was automated okay wow okay but you know you can you can imagine up running out even manually if you want you know um so yeah so you know uh uh you know if even if you have a hero product you cannot change it anymore or or it takes so much time you have to go through so many directors and approve extra approvals to justify why so yeah it's very very painful for people so when this happens uh what what you know generally what I see is basically that people start being extremely careful with the overrides they perform they only perform forecast overrides when it's really really necessary and they know for sure that the system forecast is wrong wrong and they can do much better and even when they override it they put like a much more uh reliable estimate of what the forecast is going to be okay what the sales are going to be okay just to explain that just to give you an idea you have the the accuracy of the system forecast then you track the final forecast and then you're going to see what is if the impact of the human is positive or negative on the forecast on at one point if it's too bad they shut down or if maybe I guess they have some alert before because you also have reported I guess to alert the person that she's not doing a great job before that I guess yes yes yes you can call them out at first okay so and and that's why you know I came out with this process in in Amazon uh it's it's very important to call them out immediately okay immediately you don't you don't wait to have I don't know uh x amount of overrides that were you know they gone bad before calling them out okay you call them out immediately so they know exactly you know what what's happening and they adjust their actions accordingly most of the time I can tell you most of the company first they don't track the change from the first they don't have automation they don't have automatic forus secondly they don't have also a problem is that the override system is most of the time very complex so you don't really know what you change you don't have even the recommendation before so sometimes when you override you don't even know what was the system recommendation and after that they don't I don't see many companies really tracking these two two separately to really alert oh this is because of the machine or this is because of the human and you are responsible for the process for many years so it's very very inspiring well also you say you don't have to forecast all the product and also do you limit the change we are talking about I like this picture we were talking just before like with your with your kid yeah you you can so you can limit the interventions in many many times many many ways okay I would say the main ones are to like first of all by use case okay so you can tell that there are some use cases where the forecast the system forecast is always is always more accurate than the user okay most of the time so it's not worth to take the risk okay so for example uh most obvious uh uh use case will be uh uh um uh products that they've been selling for months okay in general these have a steady forecast and U you know there is let's say there is no promotion easy to forecast even with the symbol moving average maybe you can make it very accurate so it's not really worth taking the risk of letting users override the forecast and you know uh with all the you know with all the uh yeah the bad things that could happen yeah um instead for examp new products is something where in general like the user might bring more value okay so this is something maybe you want to allow people to override for new products again um you can go One Step Beyond and then say put guard rails on what kind of intervention they can make yeah okay so maybe you can limit by how many uh we we generally we ended up giving a budget okay but you can limit uh how many products they can override they cannot override like the entire selection maybe they can override just I don't know 20% of the selection um how many units is there a maximum amount of units they can put like 10,000 100,000 you know interesting yeah value uh or or value yes yes of course of course um and all sorts of uh uh uh rules that you can come up with okay even better if you can actually if you can actually put like a an approval an approval tree okay let's say maybe you can override for I don't know a thousand units and then if you need to go beyond from a th000 to 10,000 you need the this manager just your manager approval and then from 10,000 to 100,000 you your director approval you have this at Amazon uh no no we didn't have this we didn't have honest because I know I I met a company at this and it was a nightmare because the manager was always approving all the time and and traveling they were not approving and then it was a mess so right but you know it has then regardless have to be high enough okay the guardless have to be high enough okay okay um uh yeah uh um yeah I think if you just if you just put this this these two uh uh uh things into the process like three things okay remove removing the the rights uh so just to recap removing the rights um if if the person constantly uh uh uh uh lower the the accuracy of the forecast yeah um and then you put uh boundaries on what kind of use case they override and then even when they can override you put some boundaries on the kind of uh changes they can make okay in percentage point or in absolute value you both okay I think yeah I think that's very good very inspiring not easy to implement uh especially like if you work in Excel and you want to separate the system and the human it's even more information but I think it's good to see the also the future and see what you could do you can also maybe start by tracking uh you know it could be the commercial input not by item but by category uh you could even you know because also get some sales forecast by category and they was always 30% above and even starting from this very similar very simple review can really sensibilize and also with stop having this uh completely useless talk to say who is right because we don't have the numbers if you have the numbers and you can show the truth then it's easier to uh to to improve the situation so thank you for sharing this example and I see you for another episode
now we're getting closer to the end of this journey of forecasting you did most of it the last chapters are much faster no pressure you can start relaxing and enjoying the end of this journey and what we're going to talk about now we're going to talk about how to automate your forecasting process automating the process is critical and I can tell you most of the people around me I can see that they are they are working like fire fighters they're always repeating the same task and you probably are in this situation even if you don't have lot of things to automate even if you only lose one hour a day this is 1 hour a day that you are not using to really bring more value and Analysis and decision for yourself and for the company and to be honest this is not fun to copy and paste and to waste your time doing the same stuff every uh day so what we're going to talk about is how to improve this situation and I did a lot of survey during my webinars and live and 90 85 or 90% of you have this feeling of fighting and the focus of that is not it's not because of excel Excel can also help you wherever you have a big or small company uh in in your company but at the end we have to focus on what we have an impact as well and I can see many people they say oh to have automation I need to have a new IP system great so you're going to wait for three or five years or I need to have a new director I need to have a new culture in the company because we don't have any process so once again I'm going to go back to this uh this schema that show really really show you that you really need to focus your automation process where you have an impact as well for the next few weeks and at the end of this chapter we're going to talk about how to leave Excel if you're still using Excel today but if you go back to the steps the task you have to automate you have for me eight task to automate when we talk about forecasting you need to automate the collect and the standardization of your data you need to also automate the the transformation and the data cleansing you need to automate the consolidation of the data with less v c as possible you need to automate the calculation of your forecast you need to Auto automate the update of your forecast the update of your file you need to update the export of the file and the spread if you want to for example share it to like um for Logistics to uh production to manufacturing to HR uh if you want to sprad to components you need to do this in a very very efficient way don't reinvent the wheel and don't do a multiple times the same forecast in multiple uh in the multiple Department in your company you need to automate the monitoring and the tracking and you need to also make sure that you document the way you automate because if you don't document and don't share the process to everyone around you and no one knows how to update the file is going to be very complex so that's what we're going to talk about the next chapter whatever the tool you use you can automate this is not about the tool this is about the process the automation process wherever use Excel python sap or machine learning
in this episode I wanted to go back on the foundation of the automation which is collecting data transforming cleaning and consolidate this is really if you don't have this Foundation you can try to automate the rest but you won't work in a good way so keep in mind we have a lot of source of data from cloud Erp system WMS bi database or Excel file we do have a lot of company on using a lot of files and the challenge of it is it's very messy and when I was super director marketing was using like every uh market leader or product manager was using a different template for the new products a different template for the promotion there were no template basically every forecaster were using a different file and it was a mess it was a M it was impossible to consolidate because everyone had his own way to work which doesn't work so all use software we're going to talk about it later or you make sure that you standardize and you collect the um the information in a very like uniform way okay only one way to use it so if you have a forecasting file and you have for example five demon planner you have exact the exact same file there is no one more colum for one uh one person or it's at the end of the files and you don't have any impact if you have new products and you have many people we we we teach you how to create this this kind of template you should use the same template for every everyone and the big boss the big boss and the directors and I was part of it it was mandatory to use a specific format it could be an Excel it could be a Google doc online but it's very important that everyone use the same one same for promotion there is only one format and also use selectors I was using selector when we click on on the file I'm going to show you now so on the file what I did for example with promotion is when you want to create a new promotion you have no choice you have to select the category the subcategory and you have a selector for that you have the price change you can you can't do minus 35% this is not part of the standard of the company and the exposure type okay I'm doing a solo discount with this specific client and you don't leave people to write down what they want because they're going to say oh but it's not it's a solo discount with 2 L or it's a minus 22% or the impact is not the same blah blah blah blah blah and at the end it's a I'm using I'm sorry but because most of the company because they are not strong enough to Define structure so your goal if you are the first one is you're going to create a template you're going to show that it's very efficient and then you're going to share it to the world not to the world but to the company to make sure that everyone is using your template okay I trust you for that this is very important that you have this these selectors and you don't leave people too many rooms for mistakes now if you go back to transforming and cleaning you can do it with multiple tool and I I've been using Excel why because this is very fast efficient and cheap to BNS and for the consolidation you can use different way for example if you use an Erp you can create you can ask to your it Department once one more time to consolidate and and move Data before you extract to your Excel file for example in U in uh in sap you could use for example sq01 it's like you create you create query into sap it's very similar to powery to be honest it's very database driving and um and you're going to ask to your it Department or maybe yourself to create or meas Data before you extract then it's clean and you don't have to do any manipulation if you don't have that you can also create a data L as to your it department or you can use powerquery which is very very powerful it can really help you uh to go much deeper I use Pro in a very simple way I really show you the more simple what you can start today but you can go much deeper and connect multiple table between them if you really want to create your own database thanks to power query and the more you will do in power query and the less you will do with video C and and Excel the more it will be efficient relable and the more it will be efficient for you so if you want to go deeper you can check my uh my course Excel xare and I'm going to teach you how to build clean and automize automate everything with Excel we I'm going to go deeper with po Cory and po pivot but I'm going to show one example right now so this is for example one example of this is for my SM analytics course so if if you want to create an amazing dashboard and for that I had multiple table with much much more data much more data and I use what we call po pivot and in power pivot you can basically connect multiple table without even merging like we did with po quy this is an Advan uh this is much more Advan that's why you need to learn how to use it but just to give you an an appetizer you you have this this is different queries and you can connect them and then when they're connected basically when you can do a a table not only with one table but with all of them in the same time which is very efficient for automation for relability and also for dashboard if you want to create amazing dashboard just to show you again for example this dashboard all the B the table are all connecting and when you select 2021 it's going to update it's going to update all your dashboard in the same time I don't know why my screen is moving like this okay you can see up up all my numbers are moving and everything is connecting automatically so that was just an example of the power of power pivot and I see you for the next episode
in this episode we are going to update this forecasting file finally so I've done it few times but I really want to show you the process the most important of the automation is what happened before and if it's done properly it should only take few seconds or few minutes so now we have this file and I want to update this file every single week or every single month depends how often you want to do it how do I do that very simple because we spend a lot of time you spend a lot of time at the beginning and then you save 100 of hours of automation so what we're going to do we're going to go to your the data you have and what we're going to do you can save this one and copy it here just to make sure you uh you keep the the data we had before and what you have to do is like every every month or every week you do like this and you replace to you you do like this for example and you replace make sure they have the exact same name so you can do like this you can delete and you replace by the exact same name okay sales we you remove copy on this one okay so you replace the file every uh every basically every week or every month and then you just have to press refresh in this one we don't have the next month's result yet so I'm going to do it manually you can open you can do it with me it's going to be fun so let's open the sales of this one I'm going to create a fake a fake uh update a fake data set so what we're going to do we're going to say you know what July first of all because August we had the month was not complete was less it was I think mid of the month so I'm going to copy all the value of July into August just to you have an idea and I'm going to say you know what for this specific months I'm going to use the month of May so this is not the real data but just to show you how to do it and don't forget to update this is September okay so now I have this is C current September the September is not finished yet so this is my quantity I'm going to say don't forget to save very important then we're going to go to the sales oh that was no sorry that was the value now I'm going to do the quantity that's the quantity and I'm going to do the same of course if you have real data from your IP you don't have to do that just to to pretend I'm updating the file with fake data don't wait don't wait for the next month if you want to try your own file as well and I'm going to do the same I'm going to do like this and I'm going to do mounts number nine don't forget to save you don't even have to close it I think well let's close it but you don't have to then I go back to my file and what I have to do if it's working or it's going going to work I want to see everything up to date my forecast my dashboard my consolidation everything all my forecast here okay so I'm going to do simply refresh all like this and then you can drink a tea like this usually you don't even have time to talk to your colleagues boom something is happening boom boom boom boom and here we go you can see boom we have another month the full the month of August is full now my new gross is not plus 6 but plus s because my month of August was very strong the same level than July as you can see and if I go to my forecast file it's amazing now I have the month of September automatically because of all the formula we did before I have my new forecast noise starting from September so all my forecast are up to date if I take for example this product it's up to date with the new mon you can see like everything is automatic and linked now my next month focus is September because it's not full it's not finished yet and you see everything was instant the only thing you have to be careful for new product you can see like you have this 300 change quantity this 300 was for next month but because now uh the next month is September he considered it's going to be August in 12 months so what you can do you can just delete it and then it's going to go back to an automatic forecast and this is the next month you can also if you want in terms of visual you can you can cut this this colon and P it on the left to make it more you can just cut and move it just here then you have the when you want to change quantity you you make sure that you have you have the same logic between this this one and this one but I explained before why you have to do it in a in this way because otherwise you're going to you won't be able to override at the the right place okay so that's for the that's for the file and we're ready to go so you see even the ABC analysis was updated automatically because we know we're using the 12 month the six months sales and forecast and because we have new forecast this colum is up to date so we have a new ABC analysis every time we're going to update this file and know we are ready to go we are ready to to to roll to analyze and to really F go back to okay what is my accuracy what is my availability don't forget as well before you update the file to copy and to copy the forecast history don't before you update the file you should copy the forast history I forgot to do that so I explained that in my previous episode uh in my previous chapter or with the forecast review but before updating you should just copy and paste this colon I forgot to do it you should copy this this color done before the forecast okay so be careful it's 2023 up and then you just refresh and you have your accuracy I refreshed the file just before clack clack clack and you have your accuracy which is even better in the month of August now you can see the accuracy and also this is linked to your file that was just an example don't forget it's better don't forget before you copy and paste the forecast history then you you update your file and then you can work and analyze one more time with the uh the bottom up and top down analysis a code the biggest error etc etc so I hope this is clear for you try to do it on your own pace but at the end once you have this automation you can really focus on analysis and decision making
in this episode I want to talk about the multi sight forecast you can have this example when you have multiple Warehouse that sell the same product or not the same product for example you have one warehouse for Bic bicycle one warehouse for clothes with with have with much more Automation in the warehouse or you could have like two separate region one Warehouse in America one Warehouse in Canada or one Warehouse in Europe and at the end you the question is where should you do the forecast and to be honest in terms of inventory management I'm talking a lot about it in my inventory management course but you should have less Focus as possible and you should consolidate your inventory as much as possible because yes sometimes you're going to save some outborn transport by having multiple Warehouse or factories but at the end if you uh spread too much inventory around the globe you will have much much more over stock and you'll have a big problem of shortage management and distribution as well so recommend to really simplify if you have too much inventory this is one of the the fundamental if you have a big if you have to too big house you will have too many products inside your house and if you have one one house you will have much less products that you don't need okay when you have too much room you use it that's a principle of life if I go back to this so how do you forus multiple site that could be the case and um what is really important first is to understand you need to standardize so you you could use one file for everything and put all all the information into one file or you could consolidate multiple file but for that you need to have the exact same format which is very very important okay so now we're going to go to excel I'm going to show you how to do it so in Excel you have two options if you want to manage different sites the first one is you focus everything to one file the good thing of that for like this is the file you have you can see there is a site so you can you can add extra column for people but also for location could be Factory one Factory 2 USI for example there is only USA 1 but you what you could do you could at the end of the you could say for example oh if it's the same you have to duplicate all the item code with another you could say for example USA 1 you could call it USA 2 and you can say okay there is another flly bike USA 2 in this specific location and you're going to do all the same process one by one and you're going to basically redo the forecast and you will have sales for you just have to be careful when you consolidate to make sure that you you really connect the the sales of USA 1 and this product so you'll have to do concat concatenation and the link of these two category USA 1 and this uh in addition uh to make sure that when you get the sales you have the sales of the of the USA 1's site and USA 2 okay so one solution you have all the forecast into one file with different side and because you have a new Coline you can do pivot table you can filter and when you do the consolidation like this it's going to be much easier because you have everything into one place okay so you when you're going to consolidate you're going to see the total revenue not only of one side but of all the side you can also add a filter of site one and two if you want to see the the distribution of these two so that's one solution but to be honest most of the time when you have two sites you have also two people doing the forecast so most of the time you have two separate file one file for site one one file for site two it's also easier if you have two two people because it's going to be uh who is using the file when so you have an access management as well and to be honest I recommend for most of the case to use the exact same file but two separate file okay and then you can do a consolidation of because at the end what you need you need to have a consolidation of the forecast in quantity and the forecast in value for finance for logistics for production etc etc and for that you have two options or you copy and paste or you try to do vup or one more time you use power query so I'm going to I'm going to show you how to use it in a very uh simple way um I'm going to show you just one example it's going to be a bit fast but just to give you an example so let's let's consider that we have this file okay USA one and we're going to do another one we're going to use I'm going to duplicate my file that was the file forecast review and I'm going to call this one site two site two okay so now let's say you have two F site one and site two and you want to consolidate and you want to have a new um you want to consolidate the forus of these two site okay so what I'm going to do I'm going to open a Microsoft Excel consolidation and what I'm going to do I'm going to use powerquery and this is just to give you an idea and if you want to go deeper explore by yourself so from Excel work oh wait wait a minute what I have to do for this specific one I'm going to need to change the site so what I'm going to do I'm going to create USA 2 oop two of course you should have different Focus but in this specific case I'm going to keep it simple so I'm going to save now I have this colon usa2 great so now I can go to poquer from file Excel I'm going to go to excel forecasting first I'm going to get the first one which was forecast forecasting exper review enable to connect so I don't know why sometimes I have the I because I need to close it I don't need to save so get data from Excel okay forast review okay and know you can see I can have access to my first so I'm going to get to the base one and you have all the base I'm going to transform data great great and now what are we going to do we're going to do the same so I'm going to call this one site one and I'm going to do the same for I'm going to go to new source file Excel workbook and I'm going to do the number site number two where is the site number two side two make sure they stay in the same location with the same structure very important they have the same structure okay same colums same name of colums okay right now know you have the side two rename site two so now you have this and what you're going to do this time you are not going to merge because merging is adding different columns from different for multiple typ this time we're going to upend queries so you go to upend upend queries as a new and what we're going to do we're going to do the first table and the second one and app means we're going to we're going to add information of these two in the same column so if you have for example 50 millions of of quantity of the first one and 50 million of the second one you're going to sum all of this so we have site one and site two press okay I don't know sometimes you have data privacy you just press okay and you're going to open boom and now what you can see you have site one and site two in the same file and you have all the information you want everything so now that you have that what is important for me is to have the the the dollars M plus Z in in dollars in value right so you do like this and you're going to we're going to consolate this in a few minutes only you're going to click close load two let's have a look on the table first so you can consolidate immediately with no macro these two file which is amazing you have the site you have all the information you need and at the end you can just privot table the end of this table M plus 0 m plus one okay so you can do like this or you can do directly right click load two and you transform into pivot table report okay you're going to leave the table and what we're going to do we're going to go category and then M that was dollar M plus Z and one 2 3 4 5 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 and know we have the consolidation we could also include the site site like this and you could say oh what is the revenue of site one site two you could also copy like this you could maybe just say no I don't want to have the category I just want to see a site like this of course we have the same Revenue because I just copy and paste my file but at the end you you can see that consolidation is super easy and super efficient and that's why I love for for that and you just have to refresh all and it will connect to the other file and refresh and get the information automatically so if you work into consolidation make sure that everyone has the same file and then you can consolidate and this is super efficient and amazing so that's it for the for this episode I see you for the next one
in this episode I wanted to go back to the component forecast so the component forecast we talk about it at the beginning of this course that was a long time ago and I wanted to go back to yes we did a forecast of a final product a shirt a bike um like a flying bike to the all these clients but you can maybe you are responsible not for the finished goods but for the component or the raw material right so if you're in a factory for example you have the production with you have the replenishment of the the production with components and you have the finished goods and you could forecast the finished goods or you could forecast the the consumption of components or the consumption of raw materials right so I'm going back to this example I was explaining before uh you have multiple option if you want to forecast finished goods or um finish Goods final products or components okay you have this bicycle if you have this bicycle for me the the the best way is always to be as close as possible from the customer the final customer so I recommend if possible to do the Finish good sales forecast you have your for example you're going to sell 100 bicycle of this model okay great and then you're going to just spread your forecast automatically okay that mean that we have 200 Wheels uh 200 tires 200 Rim 200 chumber maybe we have if you have this we have a also maybe in the sub component maybe we have screws or we have any small small components and then in the raw material we have aluminium we have iron etc etc so for that most of the time we have a bill of materials that will automatically give you the repetition in quantity volume weight of every raw materials and components and if you already have a solid forecast you can do it this way but most of the time you don't have even the forecast and for example uh you are in the factory you don't have much visibility and you have to do your own forecast based on the consumption of the components and this is completely fine if you don't have or any forast or if you don't have a relable completely like the this forus is really not uh like very uncertain I will say you can just use just replace the sales by the conception of your components and you do the exact same file the exact same principle that you have for that maybe you won't have promotions but you will have a production uh planning or change or shift uh planning it will be less commercial for sure but it's working as well and I've been doing this as well for many clients the option number three if you have raw material is to do the same with the consumption of your raw materials when I was in Malaysia I was working for a factory doing like copper wire and I was no like the forecast for my the sales was very vague and very macro and no details so I was really focusing on the the consumption of the copper in my factory and I was doing seasonality of the consumption versus last year Trends etc etc so that's another way to do it and whatever the way you use to be honest to split the forecast automatically from Finish good to components it's easier to have a system that do it automatically the most difficult for me is to have an accurate forecast and then to the split you can do it in Excel or you can use a software that is doing it if you have an ARP it's probably do doing it for you and then you have the question of inventory management and Safety stock but this is another topic
okay so now it's time to leave Excel goodbye Excel yes even Ed can leave Excel uh you remember where most of you are still using Excel to forecast or you have a mix of Erp and and Excel and like most of you and you to be honest you have multiple options and I use Excel uh during the last the last weeks why because this is a very accessible free tool and very good for to learn to really learn the it's a very P ped pedagogic tool to uh to become better very quickly with no approval no access to a specific system but at the end you could use a forecasting software so that's a new trend you can just plug and connect I'm going to go back to this you could improve your Erp process or you could even use python or machine learning directly so what I was explaining is the best tool really depends on your priority if your priority is the time to implement you should stay in Excel you should start with Excel if you want to uh if you really want to have a big system integration you should definitely improve your Erp system uh if you want low cost Excel or python so you can pause this video one more time I love the Simplicity and flexibility of excel when I'm a consultant I always start very simple straight to the point and then I'm going to tell you what to do if you want to go deeper the override focus is always complicated with Erp and not always great with focusing software and the simulation of real of Excel for that so there is not a perfect tool at the end you have to go back one more time what do you have an impact you want to go fast or not and at the end solution number one you should you can and you you can try to improve your IP first you can you should improve the way you use it before changing it try to find the documentation try to find the way it works the system is using and use Excel to analyze the way it works and you can so try my Excel forecasting tool compare with your sap forecast or orle or whatever the IP you use and try and to compare which one is the most efficient which one provide the better forast accuracy and I was an expert for for many years in this with this kind of tool and um and yes sometimes it was better to be completely automated sometimes it was better in Excel so you have at the end the best solution is the one that will provide you the best forus accuracy there is not one best tool of best software and when you transform and clean you can also use Excel to transform and clean and send it back to your Erp the solution number two is a forecasting software I was explained that before uh it could be a black box but this is a new trend instead of changing your allp you plug and connect this kind of software and at the end uh they they can do a good job especially if they're really focusing on your platform and your industry uh if you have to to choose one I won't give you one name because there is not a perfect one and uh I don't want to recommend one because I'm not paid by one of them to BNS the most important is the integration at the beginning so for example if you have Shopify try to use one of the most famous one with a proper integration in Shopify then you don't need any Consulting I try to use one for example for sap that already have all the link to sap and also try to get one because I can see many focusing software they generate the but then they send you back an Excel file and it's better if they can override directly into your Erp as well okay then for me the most important is also if it's user friendly if it's great to um analyze if it's if you really understand also what is behind because most of the time they say it's a secret formula so you don't know but you also lose the trust of the people behind that and you need to understand why is behind the seasonality the trends Etc unless you have machine learning and then this is a black box but we're going to talk about it later so forecasting software could be a solution not as fast as Excel but it could be a solution if you don't want to change everything python is another one so python is not a tool this is a language but this is a language with a library beyond that we're going to talk about it in the next chapter so have a look after and we're going to tell you more about this technology and at the end you can use what I was talking about you can also use Excel this is okay to stay in Excel this is not a big deal and if I go back to my conclusion of this you can start analyze and learn and improve with excel in weeks then you get better you get results you get Trust on in your team you get also more maybe money and that's what I was doing you will get better focus accuracy maybe a better service better profits and then you can decide to explore more or in the same time you don't have to do it step by St you can also explain the same time and when I was a product um project manager in supply chain I was doing I was using Excel I was Shing the result and then I had money and resources people to make it automatic in this kind of e like sap Oracle etc etc so go on your way go step by step at the end focus on what you have an impact and if you have more responsibility and you want to prepare the future you can also prepare this transformation but this transformation can be very very long very expensive so get ready and be be patient for that my conclusion is automation is not only about the tool it's about all these steps and you can use the step whatever the tool you use in the system and don't forget as well to document and share how you automated everything to make sure that you don't rely on one person in the company
all right so now let's talk about how Amazon automate everything and for me Amazon and you Mario you represent the the automation machine not only for forecasting you always told me oh my machine learning is doing the job for me uh but not only this compan as this culture of automation with also robots in the warehouse and they also have a very unique um it system and I wanted to ask you what are the what are the advice from uh the automation expert not fusing but automation expert to have automate an automated life and process in your in your company yeah obviously I mean first and foremost you need U uh people who are uh who likes to automate okay who are good at automating yes uh very structured okay um second then you need you need to create start creating processes I think it's the it's the uh is the Second Step okay once processes don't are are super simple to to create okay um they don't require like a a it infrastructure or it expert okay they can just be written on a piece of paper okay but they have to be they they have to be very very well thought okay um even better if they are kind of viral process so people have to people adopt the process because it makes their life easier okay and not because it's something they have to do okay um because that that will become very complicated they the process have to uh be very good at driving adoption okay okay right and then once you have the process you keep improving it you keep tweaking it and then after that you can put it into a software okay this is the third step you put into a software so uh uh if you have a company that just has a just a monolithic software just one thing one big thing for example yeah I'm going to give you an example sap I've been working with sap for 10 years and it looks like you can't do anything and when you want to just you know the color of one of the screen it's a two years project because this is the reality that's why I come back to excel because that's the only thing I can do so I love your idea just to go back to it uh yes you need to have people that love automation uh that also process is the first step not the tool and I see many people that have this ISU I don't have the right system I cannot automate and I think the process is always available I love checklist as well you know this kind of checklist but then for the last one you say monolitic okay tell me tell me more about this non yeah so sure so Amazon has a it doesn't have a a a software okay uh it has a multitude of services like thousands really thousands of services okay that communicate with each other okay so even if even if for a specific specific product like to manage promotions for example uh you see you it seems like you have a one software it's just one user interface okay behind the one user interface there are tens of different softwares that communicate between each other through apis okay okay but the advantage of using this architecture is that basically you can everybody everybody I mean few people can change very very quickly you can change few things very quickly okay you don't need a lot of approval I mean unless the uh you know the consequen of what you change are very drastic okay you can go you can you can build very quickly you just maybe need just one or two people who help you um um yeah it's it's it's super Nimble and it keeps constantly constantly improving okay even like because it's a five billion or six billion dollar company I don't even count anymore like there they still have this flexibility and Agility to evolve yeah yeah truly they do truly they do yeah uh in some parts maybe less than others but yes um they do have it and um yeah I think this is a choice that's has been made since the very beginning okay okay U to build uh uh as as a a multitude of services as a um yes um how do you get to that because like the thing like let's talk about how they get to that and then how what you do if you don't have this culture so you say oh Amazon I this vision and uh so oh we're not getting we are not moving to sap like everyone at this time and we're going to build uh like an AP IPI Services what was the what was the the secret I mean again the first step is always building processes okay it doesn't require um it or very little uh uh I think that's the very first step because it's a it's also a proof of concept okay before going one step farther okay once you get the point that you get you have a very good process and you want to automate it uh uh then yes what you can do uh even if you have a monolitic software like sap is start to uh look at the technical details okay so basically how can I uh uh download information from sap okay yeah yeah export information automatically uh frequently okay very quickly and then how can I import information into sap in the same way okay it may be through apis or maybe just through exporting doents I don't know but this is gives you let's say a a way in and way out okay uh from the monolitic software and then you can start building uh small services that interact with this monolithic block okay to improve it but again um you need you need you need to be very very uh structured when you build all these uh Services okay because you have to be sure that they always work uh uh so you need u in general like people this is more of it conversation maybe people use softwares like GitHub for example they basically help you yes help you review the software help you follow how the software goes into production follow all the pipeline let say uh track when something is not working okay with alarms and stuff like this so it's a it's a it's a it culture I would say uh uh that help you keep track of like thousands of of this mini microservices if you can call it okay and it's not a like because I've been in these companies with a lot of like five of one 1,000 software and it was a mess it was a mess and the data was different like the inventory value was different everywhere and I think because first that they didn't get the right foundation they didn't get the right people in the beginning people were leaving not same and uh yeah maybe you have something about like you are in a tech company so I I think the Choice also yeah you need you need people who are really professional okay in what they're doing okay they're using the right tools um so they're documenting everything even when you publish some code and stuff you know it has to be reviewed by other people you know the the the yeah the process has to be really really really really uh uh structured okay yeah um yeah and then um what was your question again no it was like oh is it uh if oh it's it's possible it's not a mess because of uh oh because you have so yeah no it's it's not a mess as far as you you know respect like uh uh uh the rules okay on how the job should be done okay uh and and you have everything organized you can even even just not so many people can manage like thousands of services as far as they're doing everything properly okay with alarms with automation with documentation and um you we also have like uh um uh rights automatically transferred where someone leaves okay okay other colleagues are automatically inheriting the ownership of some services for example or other teams okay there is no there is a never like a situation where microservices are just in Into the Wild okay so just to finish let's take one example uh let's say you implemented for example an override forecast process that became a a tool as well can you tell me about was it fast to so you did what Excel first then you what was the different step um I would say a year a year or so I mean there are different there are different um um um stages of development okay okay so maybe the first stage was one year and then then you keep improving and you know the first St was what going you one year I would say oh yeah yes yes so so the idea of course you have the idea you have a prototype you you put into production a prototype okay so you already uh working with the Prototype it might be in Excel I think it was in ex but part of it was in Excel okay you know we connected with database and stuff like this of course but uh uh uh and then once yeah and then once it works you you can prove it works you can prove it improves the accuracy you have factual data then you justify the investment okay okay now we we this one we have to make it like to become a software okay to adopt it worldwide and then and then you can go ahead basically and then make it the investment and you know exactly what you're coding because basically you the the the prototyping stage you iterate much more you change many more things more quickly so to have something nimble like an Excel for example or just a process a written process you it's just easier and then once you you nailed it then you can you know build a software make it into a software and then you know you keep you keep you keep improving it but like let's say 80% of it is there at least the global structure is there because if you as you said I think before if you mess up at the very beginning it's very diff you you create the wrong structure yeah it will uh uh you will not be able to do certain things for example okay that's why like I have many example like uh that's why I already start with Excel because there is zero cost except my time and you can assess the the results and you remember we were working on this business object Pro bi project and they wanted to go directly into this sap business subject and it cost millions and no one wanted to use it like basically no one because it was it was not it was not respecting the first steps and yeah than thank you for for sharing this culture of automation I think what I really like is the first step is not the system but it's the process then the process become maybe an Excel and maybe the Excel become a software and this is this culture of improvement not only for the forecast but for everything that can really create a culture and if you don't have this culture in your company I I met many companies were not like this but I was creating my own culture and my own process and Excel and different in my in my way uh with my with my own culture of Automation and I could also Implement these tools into sap orle S400 Erp because people could trust me and they could see the value so thank you for that
in this chapter my friends we're going to talk about how to empower your teams and communicate I can tell you now with all the tools and methods you have you are ready to improve the accuracy of your product of course you have products and Department that are more uncertain at others of the French bagget is easier to to forast than the umbrella but at the end you you can definitely even if you only apply 20 or 30% of my tools and methods you will definitely improve your forecast accuracy but and there is a but you are just today a lonely forecasting expert and yes we're going to go deeper with AI and python but at the end you are just an expert for now you are behind your screen you can do an amazing Excel spreadsheet forecast Trend seasonality but you are behind your screen and you are alone and in this current time where everyone everyone is working remotely uh this is important to go to the next step and that's what I'm going to talk about with you and as my friend Steve J was saying technology is nothing what is important is what you have in you have a fa in people and if without people you have nothing even with AI and machine learning the people are the most important pillar in any kind of companies and structure and organization okay so now I wanted to go back to this strategy and this journey you have and this is this is gold and you should really follow this path this is the the path I've been Following over the last 15 years and for now you are for most of you you are maybe in this area maybe you're already a manager or leader but at the end in terms of forecasting we came just here so we have an impact we are much better than before but we don't have much visibility reward and maybe even fun and if you want to go to the next step you have to become a facilitator then a coach then a manager and then a leader uh because if you if you really want to have an impact to impact not only your work not only your perimeter but the whole company all the Departments and even the suppliers and the customers around you and that's what we're going to talk about in the next episode
so after becoming an expert become a facilitator I've been talking about it before in uh in in early in this course and it's very important that you go you go to the next step if you really want to facilitate what is the role of the facilitator one more time you your role first is to feed the forecast you need to have the best and most standardized information and data as possible with it sales marketing product finance and for that or you have a passive approach and you just wait or you just complain about marketing or sales or Finance or you become the facilitator and you you go you go to them you explain to them what you are doing you also help them maybe to you maybe you can show how to use Excel or po quy maybe you can also provide the template to marketing and sales or product for example for the new template I created for you uh for new products or for promotions the more you will be this person that really come to help and facilitate the more the easier will be uh to also for you to improve your job and your forecast accuracy because you will have more structure information to feed your forecast whatever you use Excel sap machine learning and of course after that become the facilitator as well to review the forecast and provide feedback to sales to marketing to produ okay what did what what was working maybe reporting about the accuracy for the promotions for the new product the more you will provide also information and review and positive and feedback with no complaint but really positive feedback the more will be efficient and that that's why I think that's one of the things that was really good you can become an Excel expert very quickly and you can just follow my course on my other one but at the end I think what is really important is really to be uh to be the the good face of the company in someone positive that is proposing Solutions and help and not the opposite so for that you need to improve if it's this is not the case your communication strategy first you should maybe share about your int to become an expert to your manager to your leaders so if you are an employee today I will I will share this willing of improving of learning and I know many of you um did this investment on with your personal money and I thank you for your trust and my goal is to make it very profitable but it's also important to share to your manager look I just joined ABC SP for forecasting exper my intention is to really improve the forecasting process and I also want to implement a new forecasting tool so be like possible do it at the beginning of the year when you're talking about targets goals because this that could be something very good for your performance review and next promotion and race it's always good to have a project if you work in operation if you're already a manager director talk about it in your board of director like I was doing and say hey guys I have one of my main pillars and strategies to improve the forecasting accuracy by implementing the new uh a new method a new tool and that's what we're going to talk about then you can start learning what you did with me the last few weeks and at the end also it's important when you start this project to on board the sponsor and key stakeholder so if you are an employee today uh your sponsor could be your manager so someone will really support your project and maybe uh give you open few doors for you when I was implementing forecasting tools the a Decat long for example it's a big retail company the the the CEO of the retail distribution network was my sponsor so it was very easy because he was a big boss and it could really facilitate also give me some strategical resource I could join specific meetings to share my project and also I could get budget uh in a more easy way in in a fast way because he was he was the big boss but it could be simply maybe you are in in Supply CH and you you can have the someone from Finance who will sponsor your product because that that could be an in like a an initiative to connect more Department together but the more you will have people on board the more it will be efficient and better for you then you can kick off and with all these people involved you could kick off and explain what you're going to do in a nice and efficient presentation you can have a look at the one I did with inventory management expert if you know my course and don't forget to share monthly progress meetings by meeting or email just share what you did some visuals don't forget to congratulate everyone who is helping you from any Department I it Finance sales congratulate show the result show also the challenge and the lesson learned from this and step by step because at the end there you you need to become visible and say oh this guy is not just promoting himself he's really promoting a new ways to to communicate to to improve the way we work and we improve our efficiency but also the the reduce the level of stress in the company so I was this guy who I was very communicative I was very exciting about projects and if you share this excitement without playing politics uh this is not the same you can uh you can really if you really want to help people this is not politics for me and then if it's working then you can go into duplication of this tool to as many people as you can trainings we're going to talk about it after and don't forget to celebrate all the performance the success and the implementation of it and not only for you but for everyone around you if you follow this process I can tell you you will have much more visibility much more impact and also if this is not the case I was talking about the snop forecast review start also implementing maybe this first sales and operation planning meeting if you don't have it in a company or s s o IP sales and operation and inventory planning not only sales no s IOP Sales inventory and operation planning so to talk also about inventory butan try to follow these different steps and Implement if this is not the case you don't have to call it snop you can call it like uh alignment meeting or forecasting meeting uh to review new products promotion top down bottom up share all the graph we did in the Excel file share maybe one specific example uh the more you will be visual with real example the more you will you will be able to to motivate and to to also convince people to follow your method talk about past future forecast consensus and try to do it as many times as possible so I'm going to talk about this uh deeper for the one who wants to join we plan to create a new snop course uh if you are curious about it you can contact us and in the next episode we're going to talk about training and coaching
so the next step after becoming a facilitator to become a coach so a coach can have a negative uh point of view for for the is I'm not talking about becoming a life coach not yet I'm talking about like the the next step is really to improve the the skills and the capability of the people around you and this is for me the something I really enjoy uh this is something really fun and in the company I was first the expert then I was facilitating and at one point they asked me to duplicate all my tools and methods and to be honest I really enjoy it and that was one of the this experience that really convinced me that my my one of my alignment mission life mission was to educate more than to improve supply chain and for now I'm really enjoying this uh this journey and only doing it not only in sulation but on different topics I'm going to talk about it a bit at the end of this course but what if you want to become a coach and trainer it has to become very natural first you create the first prototype Excel is the best way to do it then you measure and improve it uh you try to improve the performance and you can show okay in these specific parameters this is working you share the results and after sharing the result if they are positive don't forget to document the process always think about when you create something it's not only for you think big then you can train one person maybe in your team you are not necessarily the manager you can say you know what I'm going I'm going to teach to my colleague to see if it's working as well for this person and you track the result and the satisfaction of the person if this is simple and good enough then you can train everyone and duplicate this not only in your your department but maybe in U other department maybe in other country I've been training giving training like in my previous company I was giving training in one team then one country and then I did I did travel in 20 different countries to show and explain all the new process for that and that was for me one of the best tool to become very visible in my company and after becoming one of the most famous trainer in the suppion kpis analytics and forecasting I got a promotion as a manager and that's what we're going to talk about in the next episode
so now you need to empower your team as a manager if you work alone you won't go very far to be honest especially if you if you have a big team you can't do the job for everyone you can't save everyone uh you have two options or you raise the level of your team or you don't have the right team with you and you need to take a important decision to make sure you have the right people in your team to support you uh you probably have to consider these two options but for sure before uh changing the the team you should definitely do your best to give them as many possibilities skills and tools uh to raise their level and to give them as well more opportunity to grow in your team and in your company so we are in this level and I really enjoy this part this is for example one of my team I don't have many pictures of my team but this is one of them I'm just here in Brazil uh my mostly doing a forecasting and Manufacturing and Demon planning it was a lot of fun it was a lot of learning as well and I can tell you when you when you have a team you know that if you're a manager or maybe a soon manager you have very different levels you have different levels if we could talk about Focus accuracy I could have the like from the the lowest to the highest accuracy could be at the like times two which is a challenge and you have different reasons for that you have the experience you have the background and the what this person was doing before you have the capacity the capability to for example do analysis being good with Cel the skills and you also have the difficulty of the perameters and be careful if you have a super easy perimeter with like only permanent stable products it would be much easier to have a good accuracy than if you have only fashion products that are changing every single month okay so just be aware of that because that could be a completely different story and the goal is not everyone to have the same accuracy but it's to raise to always improve the goal is always to improve to always it's it's almost impossible to go 200% unless you have the orders before you you confirm to your supplier but at the end uh the goal is always to improve the average of everyone but also the to improve every single performance in your team and if you have that you will be able to rely have less stress in your life and focus more on the like fun projects and not micromanaging because for me mro micromanaging is the worst thing you can do as a manager okay and the main difference between manager and facilitator if you ask me the difference to be honest for me it's more difficult to manage people when you don't have the power of recruiting firing or giving bonus or reward or promotions it's more difficult for me because you have to you have to convince people without the the management power but as a manager you have more power but you should not abuse of this power you should not like unless this is a critical situation you should convince your team that you there and you should um they should they should align on your direction and you should not force them to go to your direction if you are for your good manager and this is one of the journey I learn as well okay so now if you go back to improving and reducing the Gap your goal is really to go to this direction and what is important in terms of focusing file and goals you need to Define different goals base you need to track their performance and to track their performance like you need to know what about the performance last year or this year and based on their all if they are new in the in the parameters you should check the performance of the specific parameters for example you have someone using having the the electric electric city bike and you have a new team member taking this perimeter you should check the focus accuracy lcia of this one was 70% your goal is to do to to go to 75% this year so try to do that and in terms of forecasting file I recommend to have a separate one for every single forecaster if you use Excel if you're onp focusing software it's okay but it would be easier to manage I'm going to show you that in Excel but your goal is really everyone will own the file and it has to be exactly the same format if you don't have standardization it's going to be impossible to consolidate to do Gap analysis and then you going Your Role will be to consolidate and analyze and do a top down but up analysis and tracking of the performance and also to do the restitution to the board of director if you are a manager so now we're going to go to excel I'm going to give you a few example to improve this tracking and forecasting for your team members so in the Excel file you have two options or you create one file for the same everyone is using the same file that can be a bit messy if you have more than three people to be Hest you could like on this side you could say instead of site so I I explained to you when we're talking about autom how to manage multi sight you should you should really check this video because this is the same principle or you have instead of side you have for example the forecaster or the demand planner that could be linked to specific categories and the first question is how do we Define the which people should forus what that should be based on the total revenue on the to number of items and on uh the um it could be as well let's do a let's do pivate table and R you could you could do it by category number of item and uh maybe the revenue and you can count this and this is dollars for the 12 months or you can do the you can also use the same you can use the forus if you already have the for but just to give you an idea if let's say for example you have three people uh what you can do you can do more sort options desending like this and you could say Okay electric bike is a big one is one3 you could have okay one person here like for example Bill mountain bike and road bike maybe I have I don't know Adam and then you could have this one U 8 million but they do you have also more because maybe the closing one is a complex one so maybe you could have kilan or kids accessories T Tac kilan and maybe closing for maybe another run barara okay so that's a combination of the volume the also the what is the complexity for example you have for example let's say you have a new someone coming to your team a new person maybe the only should start on a small perimeter more stable accessories is quite stable except for the folder so you say okay the new one will only start on this for few months and then when you will get ready will take the will take more responsibility of Adam okay so this is a a practice you need to make the classic mistake is to have the same parameter for everyone the best forecaster should have the best the most important and most strategical parameters with the biggest complexity in volume in level of uncertainty and don't give too too much room for mistake for someone with no experience and no uh skills to forus otherwise you're going to pay the price very high and it could be it could be like a very challenging thing for your comp for your companion for yourself so rely on your key forecaster first okay then you have you need to split the file or you split the file directly you change Side by forecaster or you create separate file and you just contrl C and control V this file and you just remove and only keep the itm Cod and everyone should will be responsible for every single file the problem with that is you you won't have the consolidation into uh this file you only have the consolidation of the specific parameters you will be like having okay and I just have the closing so only see closing in this file but I want have the full picture and for that you will need to consolidate and for that I recommend to use power query so I've been explaining that in the automation pile with multi sites you can check this is the same principle and you will have to connect different file or you do contrl c contrl v it's going to be complicated or you use power query and instead of having site one site two in par query you will connect you will include the the same the same Excel file with the base with all the products with for example forecaster one 2 three or you can call it the name of the category and then you're going to open them you're going to go to up quer I and c as a new and you'll be able to have two table or even more than three table and you you will be able to First you import and then you're going to open all of them and have them directly into your file and what you can see here you can see instead of having the side you will have forast tone Number One forast Tone number two you will have the forast accuracy and the forecasting value and quantity for your consolidation and if you want to go to the next level I recommend you for now you are following the course by yourself but you can also build an expert team if this is not the case yet uh we can provide this course for everyone in your team you can also provide skills assessment to know what is the level at the beginning and at the end they will have their own page their own certificate and their own support with us with my team this is something that is very efficient because as a manager you don't only r on yourself you you don't have to save everyone or train everyone you're going to use our expertise our time our energy and our methods and at the end everyone will be aligned on the same uh on the same pace and you you won't spend time or energy because we're going to take care of it and you will just have to do the consolidation of all the results so if you're open to to this uh we have a team expert not only for forecasting but for analytics Excel uh Inventory management and more you can just contact us and we will support you to build with you an expert team
in this episode I'm going to tell you how to empower not only your internal departments but also your clients and your suppliers external at the company and as is explaining John Maxwell the best Rel relationship are win-win why don't more people go into relationship with that attitude and this is for me very important I can see a lot of tension and stress between clients suppliers and it should not be like this if you really want to win this is a win-win situation you for example for this supp you have suppliers not only not necessary in like part of the company could be a raw material suppliers it could be a accessory suppliers it could be also for example you have a 3pl you have a third party logistic supplier you don't own the the warehouse you have some company who is taking care of this the transportation company the import export and you also have customers and the idea the the goal of this episode is really to open you first you did you do it by yourself then you duplicate to your company and your team and then you also Empower all the main stakeholder around the company and this is something also if you want to go to the next level that is very important let's start first with the suppliers you should visit them yes we are in the world where everyone is doing zoom and team call and Skype but at the end it's very important to keep this human connection sometimes and I can tell you you can break a lot of uh problem problems and like tension between between that if you create this real connection invite them as well have a cross share a croissant a nice meal together I was inviting my suppliers when I was in front where we had always a nice meal and it was it was amazing to connect this way and yes this is a cost but you're going to save a lot of time and transparency and visibility by doing that as well so you should not forget that share your goals your vision your risk and opportunities and the more you will be trans AR with them the more they will be transparent and the more they will have visibility to also Supply your ambitious growth and forecast you should get you should share and get as much information as possible I recommend you to share your sales and your inventory to your supplier with of course NDA nondisclosure nondisclosure agreement maybe you can sell this information if this is very strategical also very important standardize the data input receiving from your suppliers and what you send to them try to make it as stand as possible always the same template always the same format not by email always the same uh or you what we call EDI it's like an automatic connection with it or you do always the same Excel template to everyone and of course you should share your short-term forecast your orders but also I recommend to share the long-term forecast what we call the plan orders even if you don't have a commitment to share the next 12 months I recommend I recommend to do it of course there is no commitment between these two between um you and the suppli for 12 months but the more you will have visibility the more they will know invest the right capabilities people resources raw materials components to make sure they can they can follow you and also they they can stop if necessary and you don't provoke a bankruptcy especially if you are a big clients for these specific suppliers so the group EA I eka Ika the the Furnitures company is very famous for that they do five or 10 years or even 20 years contract with their suppliers and components because they know that it's a win-win relationship and the more you have you have connection and visibility and Trust the more you can improve not only the accuracy but the the collaboration and the growth of the company on the client side one more time Steve Jobs get closer than ever to your customer so close in fact that you you tell them what they need well before they raise they raise it in themselves thank you Steve and at the end you should also Empower your clients V visit them often I can tell you you can see I was doing a lot of visit let's say if you're a distributor even a manufacturer go to see read your products in the store on the website visit them as often as possible and many I know many people they never do it and when you do it do it alone but also do it with your clients and try try to feel you know feel is also very important if they are satisfied about the collaboration about the communication can of course you cannot do all you cannot visit all the stores of your clients or Warehouse or website I always recommend to go Focus like the supply on the 2080 20% of your clients that represent 80% of your Revenue you can do an ABC analysis for that you can do it with a produ but also with your client and suppliers and then I have the same recommendation share the goals the vision the risk and opportunities common capis explain how you maybe you track the forecast accuracy share the data as the data especially the sales I was talking about the bu the bull whip effect before the bull whip effect the more you are deeper into the supply chain like the factory the more it's important to know what's really happening with your customer with the final Customer because maybe they're not selling and you should stop the production maybe not and as explained before you should get as much data as possible and if pay for it but I will go back to a win-win if you have more data you will have more visibility so you will improve the accuracy and the service for the customer so try also to standardize the data inputs or you get the in the promotion or you get the new products or you get all these sales activities that will impact your forecast not only for the shortterm but also for the long term and also ask your clients what are the long-term projection if they they plan to open new stores to have new deal or new like strategic decision that may impact also your volumes and the forecast accuracy so I recommend really to follow that think about the bu get as close as possible become a facilitator not only inside but outside the company and you will become a leader very soon
okay so now the last step is to become a leader not only in forecasting but in your company and forecasting is a very powerful way to do it because it really involve every single Department from expertise facilitator coach manager and leader this is where you're going to you are going to have an impact on visibility reward and also fun because it's fun to lead guide Inspire and give you know this bring this positivity in this world of uncertainty we need to have strong leaders who can really empower everyone give trust and also give the the visibility and the tools and methods that everyone want but also the mindset and I really want to go back to mindset your role as a leader or future leader you should beave as a leader even if you're not one today to really have have this one coion and really this feeling when I talk about SN is really everyone is eyeline and on going to the same direction focusing on one number and one unit collaboration breaking The Silo between every Department try to implement of course if you're a leader you can act and you can say okay guys let's start to have this kind of similar similar planning in the company where everyone knows that we are on the same page we are on the same direction I wanted to focus on the company launch meeting one more time and the celebration these two are very important especially if you're a leader you can you can make it happen very quickly what I feel in the company launch meeting is like most of the time there is there is nothing or it's not enough and I can tell you if you want to align everyone especially for to improve your forus and your launch and your all your new strategies you should invite everyone now with internet you can do it in a more efficient way but I recommend if possible that everyone is in the same room do the finan share the financial Target and the more you share Don't Be Afraid about confidentiality because at the end if you want everyone to fight for your company they should be aware of it and they should have bonus and a piece of this uh of this profit to make to make everyone win I can tell you this is much more efficient all the new strategies also the risk and opportunities you have to be transparent about the risk and opportunities the new products launching I think it's amazing that everyone knows in the company what's happening with Marketing sales products everyone should come and this is a very very good way to U create cohesion and align everyone in the same time so if your leader tried to really make it happen especially at the beginning of the year to align everyone and at the end don't forget to celebrate not only not only you know what not only if you don't you you don't have an amazing Financial year but always try to find progress and victories you did in your team and in uh in the company because you always even if you are in a challenging time maybe right now there is always things that you can celebrate and congratulate and do it not only with you but with all your team maybe invite the family but that should be a great time because at the end we come to work we spend half hour of our life working and we should do it in a great environment and always always do our best but also don't don't forget to bring more positivity uh into that so that's the journey from expertise to to become an expert to leader I wanted to go a bit deeper with you and if you look at my journey I a very similar Journey from warehouse worker to project manager to manager to SN to director Consulting coaching and no entrepreneur creators and motor for for few entrepreneurs as well so this is my journey as well and that's why I wanted to share it with you to inspire you and know what we're going to do next we're going to go a bit deeper to we're going to prepare the future um at the end of this course talking about AI Python and machine learning and if you want to go deeper regarding all these communication aspect we're going to probably launch a new program called snop that works to implement a simple and efficient SNP process if you're open to it contact us and we're going to maybe release it when we have um enough people that are ready to to enroll to this new Journey as well
let's talk about how to forecast with python with my friend Eric hello Eric hey edor and who is Eric so we met we met like 10 years ago and we had a chance to live together in Australia in manly Beach and it's not only my my friend he an expert and he joined us to really raise the bar in terms of innovation machine learning bi and forecasting and I I thought it was was good to have you to First maybe you can explain what what you did before and then we're going to talk about how to use python to forus yeah sure hey guys well my name is Eric and uh I've been working in various country France Spain Australia and companies such as violence Sony or a Telco company Tel St in Australia which is quite quite big and um yeah interesting Journey I've been a lot of uh doing a lot of uh data visualization uh modeling the the the red and green dot and orange dot you can see at the back they pretty much a machine learning visualization of the fault on the ADSL Network in Australia and that was was quite quite intense to have that five years or six years ago uh and and crazy data modeling as well I love to do data models and the one you see uh here is a is a the Sony picture data model um that I had to build back in the 2000s somewhere like that um and and RAR datas in my life because even when I'm kite surfing like the the dashboard you can see at the in the middle is is my cat surfing dashboard where I'm tracking all my sessions and stuff and what is your what is your biggest jump uh it was a 10 m jump back then not too not to yeah it's not like now the guys they're jumping so high so I'm out of the race and uh yeah lately I've been working as well on some citizen mobile application to help uh people understand what's what's happening at the French Parliament and using AI pretty much so that's pretty cool and as you can see he's a he's a data machine learning Innovation expert and now let's talk about python but first first disclaimer before the idea is not to um turn you into a python exper in in 30 minutes is really to give you like a comprehensive guide that you know what is python what are the what is the potential what the main difference between for example Excel or Visual Basic and after that you will have two options or you know what what this is about and this is enough for you or maybe you're curious and you want to go deeper I'm going to tell you what to do if you really want to go to the next step with this um technology okay so Eric what is python well python if you if you Google it pretty much it's going to tell you it's a high level interpreting programming language which mean it's a pretty easy one to understand it's very easy to read so if you read some python like it's a lot of English in there you're going to you're going to figure it out pretty much it's going to be very very logical and it's very versatile so you can do uh a lot of things data analysis statistical modeling even machine learning and all that is going to help to improve your forecast accuracy but it's at the beginning it's a programming language exactly okay so it's not it's not another Excel it's it's not a software it's not a software and what we can see for example on this chart this is the Google trans how many how many times people are searching Excel Python and VBA you can see over the last 15 years that Excel is very popular not declining VBA was res stable when never really like like pass the bar and when you see python we have a strong gross since the the year 20 like 15 or something and it's getting very and very popular not only in suppli and operation and forecasting but uh this is the the language that it looks like when you check on on LinkedIn everyone is talking about python versus Excel and should should I move from Excel to python to to be at the top of my industry skill do you think we should uh compare these two Excel and python what is what are the main difference yeah let's have let's have a chat like about that well Excel everyone knows Excel it's user friendly uh and uh and it gots a lot of built-in function so you have all your formula you don't have to figure out how to do look up it's already there it's it's ready to be used and uh you can scale it to a certain point of course if you use power query you scale it even more much more much more but uh it's integrated within the Microsoft uh product and this is why Excel came with VBA which is then a basic programming knowledge needed to to do VBA but it's not going to give you much luck you can do visualization you have to build yourself your own functions uh and uh honestly like it's going to work work well with Microsoft product but it's not going to scale and and support is going to be hard like Old School Forums on VBA like it's not going to be the best now if you talk about python well it's a programming language so you need programming knowledge and there is no interface so you'll have to figure out where to use it and but on the other side it's going to come with a lot of libraries prebuild functionalities it's going to give you Advanced visualization and it's going to be super easy to automate and scale so that's that's very bringing you to the next step that's very important it's open source as well so pretty cool so it's pretty cool to be honest like I'm a I'm I'm always a big fan of excel because it's so simple it's accessible everywhere 1.2 billion people are using Excel uh but the pr and the limitation was was explaining Eric before is like okay I want to run a very Advanced model for example in forecasting or I need to to Crunch allot of data at one point yes you can use power query to automate that but if you want to a very specific formula or maybe to compare 20 of 30 different models it's not that easy and that's why python is a is a very powerful tool for that right absolutely and it's been used so much that you don't have to reinvent the wheel everything is there you can just like pick your add-ons in the python library to extend the call functionality and they're ready to use they Plug and Play so here you go like it's going to be very easy to integrate the knowledge of people who have already figured out your problem that's the thing that the plug and placing is like installing an app on your iPhone or Android yeah it's pretty much the same and uh but the challenge is what happened before and maybe we're going to talk about like first what is the what what is the library like well the most common is p panda is stands for panel data and that's the that's the most popular library to manipulate data and do data analysis in Pyon pretty much you're going to you're going to plug that on the top of your basic Python and it's going to give you data manipulation abilities data cleaning abil it's going to support a lot of file format and you're going to be able to do some statistical analysis for time service which is what matter for us in in forecasting perfect so the P would be like uh you install Netflix on your iPhone and you can watch movies right yeah pretty much like it's a good good comparison and then well then there is one SL problem is that there is no interface on on it's it's a language so it's like I can speak the language but it sticks nowhere I have to re write my my language somewhere on a book and this is why you've got notebook uh the one we're going to use is Juniper notebook Jupiter notebook sorry and this is where you're going to mix pretty much the code the result of the code the visualization and even some plain text if you need to explain someone to a colleague and to explain how your model works like that's going to be a mixed bag of all these things but that's going to be very very uh very useful um user interface pretty much yeah so you have the language with python and you have Jupiter for example is the where you're going to you going to include the language to make the magic happening you're going to run it pretty much you're going to run it and in the next episode we're going to go deeper into how to use it
all right Eric so now let's do a demo of what is Python and how to use it what is the first step well the first step is to to install python the language itself on your computer because uh if you just write Python and give it to your computer it doesn't know how to read it so you have to teach your computer how to to pretty much read python it's well documented on the official python website so just go for that and then we're just going to deploy the Jupiter uh notebook and it's going to be a wi line command and the same it's very well documented online so it should be in easy step so that's the line basically that you have to yeah like it's like four words pipe install notebook user okay it's okay you can do it then uh then you want to open your notebook your notebook is going to run on your computer it's not running in the cloud your data is not going to going out and then you you just say python uh run my notebook and it's going to uh open your notebook in your uh in your web browser and from there you're just going to be able to create a new notebook and to select a kernel a kernel is just like which language do you want to use pretty much and you're just going to say I want to use the Python 3 ker okay you want Python 3 is the latest one right like the one the common yeah it's the most common the most common one and then well then um python itself needs Panda well we say it's like I need to plug these these add-ons so I can perform like statistical calculation without having to reinvent the code to perform this calculation so I'm just going to say install Panda and the other one here open p by Excel Excel is just to uh uh open Excel file pretty much yeah so it's like it looks like if you use visual Bic basically uh you you create the code then you run and then something happen and you can see the result right absolutely yeah so the first thing you can do is to connect your Jupiter to a Nexel spreadsheet and that would be very satisfying because in in in a few second you will have data in Jupiter and you will see oh okay that's not that and um yeah the the the command is quite simple you just point out your file you just point at the name and uh and then you just see on that data frame I want to see the top lines and that's it pretty much so like show the first five rows exactly press play and then boom and then you've got the result so let's see know one example maybe yeah absolutely so in this example you can see I'm on my local computer uh I'm just going to go for a new notebook and uh straight the first thing I have to chooses to say it's going to be a python uh notebook so yeah okay python go okay and on once I'm there I'm just going to uh add that formula just to go get the the the Excel file and to to read that Excel file so I'm importing Panda um and I'm just executing the code and what I got straight away is that bang the result are there I can see the five first line and um everything is stored in what we call a data frame and now I can manipulate that data frame and play with the D in that data frame I don't have to go back to my Excel file so for example here I'm describing that data frame so that give me all the the summary information about what's in the file okay so now we can see the the way it works and in the next episode we're going to forecast with python
all right Eric so now let's do coding without coding with python so what we going to do first how how do you code well to be really honest for that for that demo I was like okay let's let's be lazy and I'm just going to use chat gbt I'm lazy I'm lazy too well yeah I like to go straight to the point and don't don't lose any time so you can write your code or not and for example in this case I wanted to do a moving average so I just I just explain everything to jgpt here is where is my file that's the name of my file it contains columns this is the date the item name the sales quantity uh I just want to focus on the BMX uh category and give me the moving average 3 months uh for the for for that file I don't have to give my data to to to chpt when I'm doing that I'm just asking chpt to write the python code yeah absolutely and you sometimes you don't even have to specify the colon it will it will find itself oh this is the colon a date it name and sales quantity and here you go the cut is there uh we can already see things we've been discussing before like import Panda so okay it's importing the library loading the Excel file oh okay we've done that before so it's just about like reading this and then you understand and maybe you want to tweak it or not but the easiest way you copy that you pass it in your Jupiter notebook and you just run the code boom and then now well you want another model why not it was that simple so just now I want another one I want test them I want to comp them so let's so you just adapt your C to say well do it again for S model this one to be really honest I had to like to engineer it a little bit which is I had to ask multiple time GPT because I wasn't super happy with the result but at the end I figure out a prompt and that prompt I can use it now over and over which mean I can change the number of iteration I can change the name of the columns I can change the name of the file whatever that will always work and and when you don't know you can even as to co-pilot or chpt to really like tell you what to ask or what would be the the parameters to start you don't even have to dedu all of this you can just talk to him and he will help you also to build the right Cod for that yeah and the job was done so he tell he told me oh you've got to install new libraries well very good I don't know all of them but pretty much thanks thanks for the tip and then the code was there copy and passed and it was very deceptive error bang and I was I jumped in on stack Overflow I tried to figure out the by myself uh took me some time what is stack Overflow uh it's a it's a pretty much let's say Forum where you can figure out where you can find people who have find that same error and at some point I said to myself well why wasting my time again so I just asked CH fix this error and fixed it so you fixed it and just copy and past the error and boom it just told you what to do exactly and bang I had my data so now I can see for my category which which is BMX I can see for all the different products uh the past sales and the forecast sales the forecast is here so pretty cool yeah it's pretty cool and you can see there is way too much data because there's a lot of products but you have everything into one visualization which can be also very useful to see if your model is completely wrong or not exactly exactly and then well then we did a moving average we didn't a s my model so know what I want to do is I want to compare the model which one is the best test and so um well I just asked chpt now what is the next step now you we've been working those two models indeed in three the one model is missing there but I did it on three model and I asked well now I want to compare them I want to understand which one is the best so go for it so we go for it and at the end what do we have here well something very reassuring because now we back to what we know which is uh I can visualize my data I can understand that on the first chart the model has been using training data and test data so I can understand the split the breakdown between training data and test data so the training is the blue one and the the test one is the orange one we did exactly the same in Excel before when we're comparing different models so you have the split and then well and then you've got all the model plotted so you can just like uh see uh how well the model is fitting the test data so the green like you have the Sima this one then you have the exponential smoothing Y and then you have the moving average you can see and you can see like obviously that this one is not the best and then you can see also the error like the error the lower is the better and we have a winner right yeah we've got a winner we did it on three model but we could have done it on nine no problem and that's on 20 and that's the beauty of it because then it really helps you to productionize the the the the exploration of the right model for and I think the superpower is like we did that before but with python you have more complexity to set up everything but once you it's done it's much easier to implement a new model because you don't have to reconfigure all the parameters the seasonality and you can call multiple models and you can also run this on 1,000 50,000 1 million items absolutely in a much uh like faster PA than if you were doing this uh on Excel and you will have also much room to optimization as well right yeah absolutely so that's it for the the comparison and we see you for another episode
now let's talk about a new Revolution Excel plus python because it was a fight between these two technologies but now it looks like we have Excel on steroid with all uh python moving into Excel but also all these AI tools such as chpt or or co-pilot which make this uh this tool even stronger than before right yeah much easier because um what we've seen uh in in that in those example is that uh okay I had my row data in Excel I had to install python I had to install Jupiter then I had to go to another tool to generate my code then I had to pass my code in Jupiter then I have to run it in Jupiter and then maybe other people in my company work in Excel so I have to put all the result back in Excel so it's all those back and forth that we're going to avoid by having python straight into Excel but may even if you've got that there is one one one problem I don't know how to go in Python well that's the beauty you've got the co-pilot then the co-pilot is the generative Ai and you're just going to ask that co-pilot well help me doing that python formula that's going to give me key ass results pretty much and that's it so you're combining everything in one tool and it makes your life much much more easier so that's going to be a revolution indeed yes much more easier as well because like I remember like some python xay my team and he was the only one to know everything and it was impossible to just go back to it like in my team he was the only expert I couldn't understand but I could not give these skills to to people around me also you can use the the super power of power query so you can connect all the data using this you can also connect to powerbi if you want so I feel this is for me this is a game changer move from Microsoft that will put Excel again at the top as the for me the data interface for most of the companies in the world and maybe we can have a a quick demo yeah uh just showing like is the bet a version of python but it's just showing how you import python into excels that's my French background but pretty much is the same because python is is is is international anyway so um you just insert a python formula so it's no longer a formula it's a python formula and in that python formula I'm just going to Define that all the data on the left is going to go into a data frame and that's it I'm saying all the cells they go into the sample data frame and I can check it visually and I can see yeah okay it's right it's the data I've got there and now I'm going to manipulate that data frame and the first thing I'm going to ask is describe it so I'm going to go do another python formula just to Des describe it and it's going to save me IPS of time of creations of formulas that I would have to create one by one usually well in this one bang I've got count mean variation mean Max everything is there and if I want to visualize it just put the the value on Excel this would have been 16 formula and now I want to do another one I want to do a pivot table that is going to group by category and I would just want the mean sale for that category same I'm just going on that data frame Group by category and do the mean and bang I've got the sales quantity and I've got the the the mean it could have been a s it could have been whatever but it's so quick it's so quick so that's the beauty of it it's help manipulate data pretty much so it helps to manipulate and uh you are in Excel of course if you want to forecast in Excel with P turn it's a bit more complex uh we're going to maybe talk about it in the next few months or years to be honest we need more assistance with AI for that but I think it was good to see okay now this is happening and I'm sure the next few years will be a super exciting for us because it's going to be even easier and more efficient to use all this technology together to have a better forus accuracy
all right so I hope you like the introduction of python now if you want to go further and become a python expert what are the next step well let's start with small step then and let's start to pretty much run through the process we've seen before so you just install Python and Jupiter you set up your environment to create that new notebook and you familiarize your safe with the basic python syntax and then after that you can start the data link pretty much and pretty simple data frame and just playing with it and simple forecasting model and get all help you can to do that so from from AI is is a great help on that so I think that's the the really keep it very very it's like Excel keep it very simple don't try to forecast like 10,000 products do one product yeah with one model with like a very like maybe only two or three years history and one you can make it then you can go to the to the next step also maybe I recommend you to be more Curious you have multiple resources book online course um like even like um a conference about this topic is it's a very popular topic for example I recommend you the book of niika vut a good friend who wrote a book about data sence foration forecasting he also asked me to review this book so have a look if you are curious uh python for data analysis yeah is another good example and you've got so many of them because this this has been like documented like so many times so so you will always find the the book that right for you the right format blogs and website as well plenty of them medium publication are very good for that like um stack Overflow we mentioned it before it's a great place where you can figure out uh people having pretty much the same very technical problem as yours and and how they crack it pretty much so so yeah very interesting but to be honest we were talking about stack Overflow they are no going down because a lot of people are using this super assistant such as copilot or Char PT so we have ai and that's why it's going to be easier in the future to do that and also don't forget forums and communities if you really want to go yeah absolutely a very large community uh you can even a bit lose yourself in all the all the content so so I lost myself it's it's a lot of documentation and and the same like I think we're all going to be very happy in the next few years that all this this this profusion of of of documentation is is finally summarized in some uh some tools that you can access straight into Excel with a copilot for example I think the future is just it's going to be easier simple uh not going to be I don't see no code it's going to be low cut so very you just need to for me the most important is to understand the foundation of coding whatever the language yeah once you have that you can really navigate and learn a lot by yourself by practicing and for me whatever the technology you use Excel python or even sap the most important is to start fusing to measure your performance to analyze and to improve and many people came to me on link or in multiple ways just to ask me Ed I'm using python what is the best model and I always rep the same there is not one model the best model is the one that provide you the best accuracy and you should be able to do that or in Excel we've done that before or with python so if I go back to the previous Excel we're working together I was comparing 10 different models with 10 different like data accuracy and the idea is exactly to do the same if you use Python and if you want to go deeper of course you can check all the documentation I also tell you some like python forecasting model that you can call most of them are coming from the library called stats model for example auto regation moving average Sara and also even even Facebook is doing his own like you see the profit one is very popular as well or another one called XJ boost at the end you don't need even to understand what is being you just call the model you just track the accuracy and if it's better you just use this one to improve your forecast accuracy so thanks Eric for this explanation pleasure and now we're going to go deeper with machine learning see you guys
all right Mario so we we talk a lot about how to improve the forecast the next four weeks of your life but now let's talk about the future of of the forecast you for me you already represent the future because you are Amazon is the future for most of the companies today but what is the future of the future of Amazon regarding forecasting yeah sure so in terms of technology I think yeah machine learning is definitely the Future Okay uh I think what's uh uh I make the analogy with self-driving cars okay uh um more than 10 years ago we were told that basically self Drive full set driving cars were just around the corner okay yeah yeah and we were getting them like the following year and then always kept being the following years and they never came and actually nowadays people stop talking about self-driving cars because they know it's just not feasible okay so what happens is that the machine is really good at getting to 98 maybe 9 9% of the situation but sometimes uh it needs a bit of help okay so I think that's the future the future is a machine that is aware when when when it needs help and uh ask for help to humans and then ask maybe for the right information okay so the the the key here is the uh how do you merge how do you the process that basically allows humans and machines to work simar LLY and effectively okay yeah I think that's a very good example and I like to give the example of the level of maturity of your self-driving car from zero to five this is a very common scale from zero you have noing you have this very old school Ford Mustang that is just driving by yourself from driving assistant just to uh maybe it's just to control your your speed you don't you can't you can go that more than 100 miles per hour or you can you cannot cross maybe you Cann cross a specific line and then you go to situational maybe it's going to start turning or parking for you to almost fully autonomous unless you're going to A rod that the machine doesn't know never been before or maybe there is a specific danger or maybe there is too much rain or there is a storm and you need to take the control back and I think when we talk about forecasting always try to keep in mind what is my level of maturity in this process from zero to five and I think that's why we would try to give you to to Really increase the level of your machine but also increase your level personally that you also know when you you can increase the value of your forecast and when you cannot increase it and it's better to leave the machine alone also I think Mayo I don't know what you think about that but I feel also that we will have massive change in the software companies most of the companies today are still all running in Excel or with very old school Erp such as sap and I feel like AI because now it's much faster to develop and code will also give us not only assistant but way to create new interface for your tools just by prompting oh give me a new like dashboard of my new product launch and you will have it almost instantly so we'll have much more assistance to have much more friendly user and easy to use system that will be also more automated and also from my own point of view Mario I see we also need more expert facilitator forecasting expert facilitator that will be able to gather the the quality like the right data to feed the machine not only forecasting expert that people that can really connect with all the Departments really uh get the data at the right granularity that they know how to improve the system and make it even more efficient and that's that's the kind of job I did for many years to become this facilitator but also this forecasting expert that can do both so I think we have this U this Evolution human versus machine we are all growing fast I feel like right now the machine is growing much faster than the human but we can keep it up and uh if I have to change only a z 0.2% of my forecast I will be okay with that I will have more time for for surfing and uh I hope by following our course we're going to give you more maturity to move from zero to a level 4.5 or 4.6 right Mayo yes so we're going to talk about more Innovations in next episode and I see you very soon
all right let's talk about machine learning and how how to use it or it works in a very simple way like we did with python and again hello Eric how are you very good thanks the IDE is again Eric is um you you were one of the first to teach me machine learning 10 years ago and you are using billions of data points with Telecom or all these companies maybe you can tell us few example with your machine learning experience yeah absolutely well uh I had the chance to work in uh in one of the biggest uh Telecom company in the sou and Hemisphere and um yeah pretty much we're using big data to to gather all the massive information we had from the network and once you've got big data what do you do with that so you have to go machine learning and and all those uh uh yellow sorry green and and orange dots you've got at the back here they just to show the performance of the ADSL Network for example and so you want to drive the technician to the right place with a certain level of confidence and you want to the model to learn pattern of faults and send the technician to the right place and fix your Internet so it was it was forecasting uh yeah it was a fault provision yeah yeah it was fault provision and the idea is like to keep it very simple for you because with Mario my friend from Amazon it looks like it's a black box very complex but now Eric will explain us the way it works clearly we're moving to the highest level of maturity from uh from zero to to high machine learning is the is the future focusing for most service and you don't necessarily need machine learning to improve your accuracy but if you feel ready the idea is like you know how it works and if you want to go deeper we're going to tell you what to do for that
so first of all Eric you told me before like 10 years ago you told me there is two types of machine learning yeah absolutely you've got the the supervised and the unsupervised uh type of machine learning and pretty much um there the foundation once you know that you you you understand pretty much how it works so the supervised uh is pretty much when you've got a a training set so you already done a big big amount of work you already classified your data to say hey this image is a cat this one is a dog and can you please mchine learn how to recognize a cat from a dog and so you're going to give it the the training data set the machine learning is going to learn from it and then you give the the the same algorithm a test data and Bas on the test data you're going to you're going to figure out if the the the model was able to split into the category you were looking for and once you're happy with the accuracy of that you give them a full data set and it just does the work for you so well this is this is great because then you can productionize your your algorithm and vestment of data now the unsupervised is even more powerful because you're not going to tell the model what to look for and the model will have to figure out from a learning data set we'll have to figure out wow in this data set I can find different categories I can find a group a and you will have to name it the dog I can find a group b and there is even a group C with the misfit and where there are such stuff you can't classify so it's like like for is like the perfect employee comes to your team and you don't have to tell anything you just figure out what he has to do and how to deliver great results pretty much and and then you can find great Insight sometime into Data you you never analyzed before and it's just going to classify it in a certain way that you never thought about it and you're like wow that's a very great insight and um what are we going to use in forecasting well we're going to use mostly supervised model because we're going to give the model all our historical data and that's going to be the training set the model is going to learn from the historical data it's going to learn the situation of the company it's going to learn the fluctuation of the sales in the past and and it's going to use that as its training set and if we combine then supervised model with neur network that we will discuss later you will have a unique fitting model for your data so pretty much that model is not going to be a moving average it's not going to be a a s Marx it's just going to be your model the one that fits your data for your if you apply the same model in another company it will not work makes sense so tell me more about it well let's let's consider product a I I know a lot of things about that product a I know the pastel I know the product availability I know another product sales as well maybe if you sell shoes socks are very uh common to sell at the same time so maybe they're going to go together and you you know that if you know a bit more about the other products on the on the category you know you will know more about your product so there are all the things you know all the data you can access what you want to figure out is what the secret recipe so if I pour a little bit of past sell and put a little more product availability and then add some of the product B Sales does that predict my future sales of product a and what is going to what what um masch line is going to do it's going to help you figure out those weighting pretty much how much weight should you give to each of these uh parameters each of these features we talking about features then and that's be that's going to be the job of machine learning machine learning is job is going to find the optimal weight so you're going to give him things you know and you're going to put that in the box and the box is going to come back to you and say this hard the weights for you that you can use and it's yeah it's so it's it's straightforward it's like cooking crap you know crap French crap you don't know exactly how much sugar milk or flour you need and the IDE is right to find the right recipe and at be the beginning maybe he's going to also add you you're going to maybe ask do you need Coca-Cola in the crap and he's going to say no you need zero Coca-Cola but you need 1 kilo of flour and 20 gram of sugar right exactly it's going to find the right don't forget eggs eggs what what's but what's going to happen is it's it's very practical but at the same time it's very overwhelming for a lot of people because then you've got a black box in the middle you got that box it's the maschine lining box poured some data into it and I get some weight at the end and if someone challenged me and exp and ask me to explain I can't really explain and what we're going to see in the next in the next few minutes it's well what's beyond pretty much what's in that black box and how I can domestify and understand what's happening in that black box okay so it's not so much a black box if we have things we know we say we have things we know we know the past sales we know the product avilability we know the sell of another product and we want to calculate the future sell of that product and what the thing we don't know yet is how much weight I should put into each of these features all the things we know how much weight should I allocate to each of these features and while the machine learning doesn't know it doesn't know at first it just goes random and it's just going to say well I'm going to use pass data because on pass data I at least I know the answer I know that the sales for these specific months were 90 and I'm just going to put some random waiting on all these features and just make a calculation and in this case with the parameter that the random parameter ml is using we've got a result of 270 which is way higher than the 90 we should have found so there is an error of 200% well it's not good but then how do we go next like does is the model going to try all the numbers in the world and Run Forever Until until it finds the optimal well the combination if you've got like 60 features the combination will be like impossible to calculate so the model now has to figure out from that where should it Go and it will recursively adjust the the weights going up by a certain increment or going down moving the needle pretty much until it finds the right number that going to give you the the right result for that month but how does the model know if it needs to go or if it needs to go down and buy how much should I go up by 10 should I go up by 0.5 should I stay to zero am I already optimal I don't know well this is just going to use high school skill by calculating the derivative of the error and the derivative of the error just spend like a few minutes on Wikipedia and it's just going to remind you your high school and you're just going to be like oh yeah I've done that in the past I remember now and it's pretty simple it's going to give you a number that if it's positive we know that the adjustment of my weight should go up if it's negative then my adjustment should go down is it close to zero then my adjustment is small which which mean the random parameter will almost spot on and if it's close to one then the the it's was way off the the weights need to be readjusted by met so it's like I like the example you know these people who are looking for metal on the beach and this and when it get close it's like and when you have this basically you need to adjust like smaller parameters because you are getting closer to it so it's the same principle The Closer you are the the smaller will be your adjustment because you are getting close to the end to the best result and at the end you don't need to know all the mathematics behind the IDE is how to get as close as possible absolutely and what is fantastic with this method is that with only a few parameters let's say you just do you just put five parameters in your model you could almost done that by hand like I remember when I was doing the the course at Stanford that um they were asking you to do it by end at some point and you were like no way it's I'm never going to do MCH learning by end and then you realize by a few iteration and a few hours after like yeah you're there you got the result and you just did machine learning writing and calculating on the paper and that that's as simple as that okay super so now in the next episode we're going to go deeper with deep learning
all right Eric now we have the foundation how machine learning works but let's go deeper with deep learning so what is that well the problem we've we've mentioned before is that if I'm doing the calculation one by one by n it's going to take a long time and it's just not going to be efficient and if at the end I realize that I should have added that parameters well I have to do it from scratch again and it takes a lot of time so what we're going to do is we're going to pretty much parallelize the work so we're going to have few neurons so few nods that are working in parallel on the same equation and they're going to they all going to start with the equation we've seen before and they're all going to pretty much um choose different set of random parameters and they're going to calculate in parallel and maybe one of them is already going to be very close to the to the to the optimal maybe another one will be far off on one parameter it it doesn't matter the the goal is that you do the same first step of calculation so across many different NS and I was to be honest like 20 almost 20 years ago I was very young I was I was using different I was using Visual Basic to optimize like replenishment and forecasting model I was also working with the MIT and it was before machine learning so I was I had 10 massive computers and they were doing all different group of parameters and we were training like by 0 0.1 and changing all the parameters and it was the old school way and know the this neuron neon like it's like a super computer but you have multiple one in your computer or in the cloud yeah and you just go faster it doesn't require a big architecture like you can it's just running parallel calculation on your computer and and now nowadays like any any good laptop can do it pretty much and so now what we what what will happen is that we're going to have a next layer of neuron and this why we say we go deep deep learning and pretty much that second set of of of that second layer is not going to start random this side it's going to start with all the knowledge of the yellow layer the previous layer and it's just going to use the result of these layers but not only the the one in front of it it's just going to use the the result of all the neurons and to say okay they already made the pre-calculation for me so I know I I should not be random I know I should hang at these these these parameters and all all the neurons then will again do that calculation in parall and to adjust the optimal and you can have as many layer as you want pretty much and pass them until you minimize the error pretty much yeah that's that's a most it's a more advanced way but at the end is just the same principle and you look like you have like like you have people with a foundation level they will try by mistake and then you have a second level that will really start from all the mistake they did to save a lot of time absolutely and then the model will stop when you have reach a set number number of iteration so pretty much you say Okay I want that calculation to run 20 time and let's see what happened after 20 time and then you will estimate the error or you can give the your model a nearo Target which mean like you you want your model to absolutely be 99% accurate so don't stop calculating don't stop iterating until you've reached the 99% accuracy well what could go wrong with that is of course uh if the model can never reach that it will just run forever so it's a bit mix of both you need to say I want to set number or uh to reach a given Target error so I was um I've seen a multiple project that it was not set correctly and uh there were no like limited numbers of iterations like how many time you're going to try and you can have billions and U I could see one company who spent like millions of dollars over training for nothing and because they were like the solution was just infinite so it wasn't stoppable and they wake up the day after oh we have to pay to Amazon like one or2 million because we did unlimit the system so be careful as well to set right boundaries to avoid this kind of especially on cloud infrastructure where you pay you pay per uh computation yeah
all right Eric so now we understand better machine learning but how to forus with machine learning like in a more done to her way how do we start what do we do well it's very simple process it's is it's the same process as are you are using for any like uh forecasting model you need data collection first it's all Based on data so you need clean historical data you can ask it Department to help you maybe doing the extract uh if you already have the data perfect and then what's going to be important is the feature engineering feature engineering is to say what uh out of all that data what um columns pretty much or what set of data what parameters what feature I will use and I will give my model to learn if I give irrelevant features to my model well the model is going to try adjust my my forecast B based on something you should not use and once you've got that feature engineering done um then you can go into the model building which is um how many layers how many nods how many uh what what should be the optimal and and and make the model run pretty much once you've got that you're going to evaluate the model and you're going to do that on unseen data so you're going to training the model is easy you give him uh training data and test data and then you can compare them and now you're just going to do it on unseen data the data that the model have never seen before and you're going to let him figure out your forecast on on past data and you're going to be able to say yeah it works and the last step is uh the model deployment so how what is your strategy to roll out your modeling production environment you're an EXL company everybody works on their laptop well you're going to be set very quickly because you run your model on your laptop and and this is it you've got a bigger Erp uh you need to put your model into it well get some help from the IT department to integrate that like in the most clever way possible so yeah thank you and uh just to give you my personal experience so with that data collection keep it very simple don't try to implement with too many uh too much data like quantity sales quantity avability price that's a very good starting point even like avability if you don't have it it's okay you can you can really start with one product one very simple clean data set improve the model then try with 10 products then one you I think the baby step method is very important of course there is a challenge to build the model if you never done that before you have more and more documentation we're going to talk about how to how to learn deeper if you want and also I can see that softwares are keep itting more like simpler for most of the yeah Plug and Play software Plug and Play is not that easy to be honest and you you're going to see with Amazon after that they don't really recommend the Plug and Play because it's not really optimized like using sap for forecasting is it's like an overall average for all industry is not really optimized but that's that's a start and then I can also tell you that I've seen many many projects on the paper I mean on the consultant laptop it was working but it was never implementing because it was um all too fast or no one in internally in the company was had no capability to do that or on in the IT department no one was really ready to implement the model to be honest I also seen people and I have a few of my members they do everything on their laptop so they extract everything with Excel they run the model and they export the forecast to the it's also like a in between process that I really like because you don't need to change everything in your company but the end goal is really to have a model that you can really deploy and that doesn't rely on one person in your company as well so now what we're going to see next is all uh what are the classic mistakes and we see you just after
all right Eric so now let's talk about the pitfall to avoid but before that we just had an Amazon delivery and it was raining like hell I'm so now it's wet it's okay we're going to keep uh recording so tell me except for the rain what are the pits to avoid for forecasting in machine learning yeah the first one is the overfeeding it's pretty much when you capture noise so the noise will come from the model trying to to fit out layers point and we'll go too deep into the optimization and pretty much um it will be very very appropriate for the past data you gave it but if you go with any other like end in dat will not work and so you have to use the uh the the the right model complexity to avoid that pretty much to avoid capturing out layers That's a classic mistake not only in machine learning is uh like we were doing that with Excel before like try to have some uh like resilient model that don't really try to capture everything yeah the second is you don't have enough data so pretty much your error rate stay very or your accuracy stay very low and well the model needs to Crunch data pretty much so if you don't give your model enough data well it's just it's just going to be enough to figure out or to iterate enough time to be to be accurate in that so yeah like you need some data that that's a that's something absolutely required and the classic mistake again for me is like you have only one year history or you don't see any Trends or seasonality I could see like a very like a massive a forecasting competition with ENT maret a supermarket group and they were only adding one year of data history to the m to the forecasting competition which for me doesn't make a lot of sense I prefer to have less product but more sales history then you can also see the behaviors of the categories then and then if you lack lack data quality well that I think that's the same in any any project that relies on data like you you're going to get something inaccurate because you're missing values so you've got an interment meting or you've got anomalies that you have remove you really need to be sure like your dll is clean your time series are clean um and that that yeah that's going to be an important point it's a very important point and uh Your Role if you do machine learning is to feed the machine so you need to feed it with the right food if the food is not good you would have you have you will have a bad result at the end and lack of data quality for example you don't have the right avability of your product at or at the wrong time or you say you have a promotion but you don't have promotions and at the end you won't you won't get it basically yeah absolutely and and then you got the inadequate future engineering so pretty much it's going to give you a suboptimal model so you need to capture uh feature that are really uh demon driving factors so if you if you are uh forecasting using the soccer results uh it's not going to be relevant but still your model is going to try to learn from it is best so it's going to include that into and it's going to figure out correlation that does not exist and you're going to get a suboptimal model then if you ignore the domainal age B you uh because pretty much uh you need and that's going to go back to the feature selection you need to understand what's going to drive the demon what you don't know is the perfect formula what you're aiming at with machine learning is to get that more accurate possible formula but you need some domain know to be sure you're not Mis misguiding your forecast Mis your model yeah and even if you've done all that the last one is the failure to Monitor and update because after 2 years your model is going to be outdated so you need to have a process to retrain your model so it's not about I've done it on my laptop I find that I need a plus b plus C and I just put a plus b plus C on my Erp and then never touch it again well the problem if you do that is that it's going to slightly go off of the time and then your Precision are going to lose in uh your your forecasting is going to lose in Precision what you want is automate as well the retraining of the model and this is why sometime it's easy to achieve the the final formula but to get all the process to retrain on a regular basis your model without spending six day on your laptop doing it that's the complex part yeah and I can tell you for this one is like whatever you use machine learning or Excel if you never really check the the the quality and if you just leave the same parameters for for 5 years at the end you could have a completely different Trend in your Market or you could have also maybe a classic mistake is also the the the structure and the category of your products if you have a big change then you need to retrain again otherwise the model will just keep the old patterns and you won't see that there is a new category which is completely uh which is completely different so avoid these mistakes and we see you for another one
all right Eric so thank you for this um great introduction and uh I think like the question now is like do you want to go further or not at least you know what is machine learning and what are the the critical path to to implement it it's a journey it was even a journey for me and I think um maybe you can tell us what would be the the next step for you like if you want to go further yeah there there is there is someone you you can't avoid on the market which is pretty much Oni and and and that guy did a a corer machine learning course and and this is this is very good because it it's going to give you all the fundamental theorical knowledge uh to understand and dentify that blackbox and this is pretty much what we've discussed today it's not going to be practical such as how you implement it on your forecast but it's going to give you the reassurance to talk about it to discuss with consultant and the reassurance to implement it and so that's a very very good I follow the course as well and uh yeah it's clearly not as like ABC don't to uh I want to focus this is the example but if you really want to explore this area the next 10 years I will definitely uh it's a very good starting point at least the first modules of the course abolutely and this is why the number three as well on that list is is is again with the same guy because uh this time it's a book and and a really good book it's going to offer you very good insight about how you can this time project manage it and implement it in the real world so yeah plenty of uh plenty of books plenty of of of tutorials content everywhere YouTube as well and uh I think the the challenge is always the same whatever you use Excel python sap machine learning it's always the same you start very simple the baby step where is the smallest baby step then you measure then you analyze and you improve and you just don't freeze and wait for like the the magic potion and you just try I I did so many um try and mistakes that now for me like it's always the same it's the principle of Life by learning by mistakes and survival and I think we willome on this and we're going to talk about um Maro and Amazon what what the how Amazon is redoing it but I think it was important for us to talk about all this foundation with you but thank you Eric thank you very much and see you for another one see you guys
all right Mario so in the future of forecasting now we talk uh we talk a lot about the probabilistic forecasting or predictive what you call it like Predictive Analytics uh what would be like your introduction like we are not talking about one forast because for most of the company you only have one forecast per product but now you say no Ed we could have a 9 forecast per per product from P1 to P99 what is what is this to topic about Yeah so basically the forecast is not just one number but it's a probabilistic distribution okay um why do we do that because basically we are introducing the uncertainty we are measuring the uncertainty okay so if the uh uh if if like the P let's say p50 from P90 the Gap is very big it means we have a lot of uncertainty about the the forecast of this item okay what what what does it mean p50 what is the p50 means yeah I don't want to get too technical but basically p50 means that we have 50% chances of selling less than that specific number okay and P90 it means we have 90% chances of selling less that number okay that's why it's much higher okay usually it's not it's not symmetrical okay so that's see we can see on the graph like you have the normal forecast and you have the p50 and the P90 right yes so when when you have just one number okay two products might might have the same number okay it's maybe 100 okay but actually when you when you if if you draw their distribution okay you will realize that although they have the same let's call it median number or uh yeah let's call median number or average number in reality they the the spread of the distribution one is much higher much bigger than the other one okay it means that that item is has much more uncertainty so you have uncertainty what what's the what's what's the value of of having introduced the or measuring start measuring uncertainty the the value is that you can use it as a think it about a dynamic Safety stock okay so basically that tells you if um uh your item is uh extremely profitable okay or if if it's strategic item for the company okay in that case you're going to buy the upper end of the distribution okay you're going to buy towards P90 okay okay if it is not the case if the item is very has very low profitability or not strategic you're going to buy closer to p50 so you're automatically defining their safety stock the Safety stock of the specific item and as as as you know you know the let's say the sales pattern can evolve over time or they can have seasonalities automatically this concept takes into account everything into this definition itself of the safety stock okay super super helpful yeah so I think it's uh now we are we are moving from forecasting to inventory management which are very connected each other and I think it's very interesting to uh to have a strategy I was talking about the ABC XYZ analysis before is like having different Safety stock strategy based on the probability and the profitability of your product when we talk about profit profit profitability sorry at Amazon is it cash flow is it margin catalog or what is the yes it's it's free cash flow exactly okay but it could be it could be you know if if we if if we cannot have like free cash flow like things like even even margin gross margin would work okay so we can see for example when another example here from AWS you have the forecast and you have the P10 is below basically you have 10% chance to be below that and the P99 is super super high and you will never use this forecast unless you are you have a huge margin or you have a huge yeah you have a because to to forus more than P99 you need a meteorite or something crazy happening in the world like a pandemic for example with toilet paper and because this forast looks very stable so what do you recommend like because it looks very Advanced unless you already use a software which is including this automatically uh what would you recommend for someone who wants to start do I need to really have 99 forecast per product all the time like what is the the first step yeah my my advice would would be that just to start with two numbers okay okay like we can call it a lower bound and upper bound yeah um um it's it's it conveys so much more information than just having a single number okay okay it gives you an idea of the uncertainty basically okay okay and then and then you can use Simple eristics to to to to know you know to estimate like based on your profitability levels uh uh you know if you should buy more toward the uh upper bound or more towards the lower bound yeah and uh and then you should classify your product and have a very simple you can have very simple Ro to say very simple oh my margin is less than 30% so it's lower bound or my and maybe combine with the volume maybe it's very if it's very low volume and very low margin you really buy the minimum the p50 and if it's a high profit high volume maybe you go to a p80 to make sure you you secure the margin and the the revenue of the company so it's a very good very good opening to the future of forecasting thank you Maya for sharing that and uh when I remember in Amazon you always say you have this watch oh is it a p50 or p70 like you have this kind of language between you guys right it's like yeah yeah yeah all the time all the time yeah is the P P85 bro and and at the end so the machine Define this automatically right you don't have any uh yeah yeah the machines create all of them from P1 to P99 of of course you know the the uh you can go all the way through but generally the the ones that are mostly used are between P90 and p60 okay everything in that range so and by the way if you if you want to buy like very low quantile these are called quantiles uh like less than p50 yeah okay uh often often these are very low so it's you better not not you know you will be always out of stock because already a p50 p50 being like 50% chances of selling less okay it means also 50% of selling more so if you're buying p50 you're going out of stock very often okay so you might ask uh asking you might start asking yourself why you have that product in this selection interesting so at the end I guess like an iPhone would be not a p50 for example like the top sellers of definitely not yes yeah definitely not okay thank you uh thank you Mario for this one and I see you for another episode
all right Mario so now let's talk about machine learning you always talk about yes you know at Amazon we have this machine learning thing and basically you do nothing and the the machine is doing the job for you you only improve when it doesn't work but now let's talk about seriously machine learning how first how did you learn about machine learning how did you become an expert um I learned about myself uh while working at Amazon uh honestly um I was extremely lucky because uh I have access at uh I had access all the uh uh server and AWS Services yeah you know for free so it's uh yeah it can be can be quite a significant cost for someone uh yeah um you know um who who wants to do it and then I also had the the row data okay the data uh a lot of data that I could use to train these algorithms and then to play a little bit with it um the data is very important because usually when you do uh trainings okay yeah they give you the data they give you the data and uh the critics that I can do is that the data is Too Perfect it's always perfect okay it's always perfectly formatted this is perfectly uh yeah it just works you know out of the box okay uh in reality uh just to get the data like in like for example machine learnings in general they only digest numbers so if you have uh colors how do you yeah how do you you change colors numbers okay how do you how should you change even uh a calendar okay okay dates how do you just change dates in numbers okay and things like this okay um so yeah this is H this is a this is a super important okay and he's of often uh neglected and you're in the right place and then I I could ask yeah and then I every time I had some uh uh uh bloggers or some things I could always reach out to experts in in in the company okay that's also a a very good uh and what was the the skill because you okay you learn at Amazon but be they they they could they were chasing you from your previous job to join them in their team what was the skills you had before that were necessary to go to become an expel very quickly if if if you want to start let's say playing around with these algorithms just some basic programming skills it's it's enough okay okay um but if you want to go like next steps and and you know really produce something uh uh that makes sense and it's powerful and it works well then to me you have to be statisticians or a mathematician need to know a lot about yeah about math in general and statistics statistic analysis okay okay so the details make makes all the difference okay all the the tiny details okay for example uh what kind of input should I take into account okay or how should the input be formatted okay it's it's tiny details but it makes all the difference okay uh so before we talk about that uh the first question I okay I want to start machine learning I love your course Ed Mario I want to become like you Mario an expert uh should I start from scratch to to teach my own system myself or should I use a a current one that is already trained and programmed for me yeah know I think it's it's better to use something that already exists so the AR architecture of of a model okay that already exists that is been built for that specific purpose okay there are so many open sources algorithms uh if you like to code or if you don't like to code there are so many uh Services okay that you can use and uh these are already been built with you know super expert people working months or even years uh to perfect them so uh just by doing like a syber architecture or by neuron network with a few layers all connected it's not going to bring you very far okay uh these models are super complex they have like uh uh basically sub models within the model okay think about electric circuit for example okay so it's a yeah it's extremely complex yeah so yeah it's definitely not worth to start from scratch start from something that already exists and then already by tuning it you can make all the difference so my my suggestion would be use something that already exist out of the box without changing too much without losing too much time see how it works see if it's works better than what you have currently okay if it is it's already a win okay you don't have to do much uh it's already a win if it doesn't but you think it's uh still promising then you have to invest a bit more resources to see how you have to tune it okay um to to to get better accuracy for example okay so you start from a current model and I see what you say before like the most important is to start very simple you were talking about the the importance of picking the right data when you start uh do you think this is the most important right like because okay I want to start what kind of data should I use should I use everything the weather forecast the number of click on my web page like what what should I how should I start I would say start as if if you're just starting start as simple as you can so basically to me like the two key data are uh sales okay and uh availability rate okay these are the two key data all the rest you can add them later okay okay first just with these you can obtain such a already good result you should you should obtain already very good results if it's not the case you know it's a yeah it may raise question it will not get much better with adding more data okay so these are the main data and then you should get already pretty good results only using these data and then if you go want to go One Step Beyond then yes you can add more and more data always more data but don't do it all in once it will be super difficult to debug to see which one is uh causing issues okay and and then to choose the right because you have multiple Solution on the market uh for example you have Amazon forast or or do you choose the right one or do you choose like should I use I mean you can you can always you can always try different I mean if if the option is to uh like take something out of the box and see which one works best you can always try many many many you know and then see which one works best for you uh you know compared you know of course the price you know the uh the the amount of support that you have from the services uh the the kind of uh um uh customer ation you can make okay um yeah these are important factors that you have to account for so you can try many and then pick up the one that you prefer or again if you want to go you know a step farther um I think you better get some help from some qualified people yeah so to be Hest I was training a few months ago the Amazon focus tool and it was it looks easy when you check the website but it's not that even and I was with a 90 person with me it was not that easy to to prepare the the system you know like because you had so many options that I know you like the every details counts but when you are you we were like quite beginning in this specific solution it was not easy to pick the right one yeah and then that's more maybe of a I would say a technical technical technical issue okay yeah um I was uh yeah I was already talking about like you know even more like going into the tiny tuning of the data okay which is more of a mathematical problem okay this this this one you're highlighting is more of a technical issue yeah but it's important because most of the time people block at the beginning at the beginning is mostly Technical and not mathematical yeah and okay then you say okay I I try different model and I want to go deeper like then you have to call an expert or what is the the last step for if you really want to go to an advance I mean there are some models that works out of the box so maybe just uh uh send the data and they give you the input as simple as that and you just make a connection you know I don't know uh whatever you want to make it uh uh uh whatever way you want to make the connection and uh API in general uh is the safest bet um and and that's it you know you can you can just go go like this uh if you want to go one step farther again uh then you have to take more things into account like uh you know which one I mean which one is the one that you know produce the the best uh results but also which one is the more uh the one that can improve uh yeah the most because it gives me more customization I can do more tuning okay um and then yeah you can you can go next level next level like you I want to become like you so uh we we are not teaching you how to use machine learning in this specific course because you need to have more advanced level to B but let let us know if you want to uh to learn how to do machine learning with Mario and I and I will make sure we keep it simple because Mario can go very very deep let us know and if you have enough people maybe at one one point we do a very specific course fusing expert specialized in machine learning thank you Mario and I see you for another one
you made it we had the last chapter of forecasting expert but before celebrating I wanted to go back to one mistake I did when I was working as a forecasting expert at Deaton so Deaton is a big spus company one of the biggest in the world and I was responsible to implement the new forecasting and inventory management system for all the retail and the warehouse and I wanted to share this mistake because this is something U like very classic I could see now you have all the knowledge of forecasting exper you have lot tools methods and you also have a lot of like like mathematics in your mind maybe it's very obvious for you but it's not for many people around you unless they follow as well the same training that you do and my mistake was I was developing and searching for the best formulas I work with the MIT in the US for three years and at the end after all my simulation I found the best model and I implement it and um and then one of the idea was to uh to give the possibility to the the retail stores and the distribution centers to to change their seasonality when they had the calendar shift for example for schools for holidays for Christmas etc etc so the idea was yeah they have to change it but directly because they're responsible for it by region and we don't know what's happening in Spain us or Asia and it was very difficult to do that automatically and that was the IDE but the seasonality for you is not obvious but I can tell you for many people it was not obvious and uh and we I realized quickly that it was we needed a lot of training just to explain the the concept of seasonality uh in sales forecasting and at the end I had to train thousand of people I had to travel the world but because because of the turnover of the you have a lot of people changing their job in the in the in distribution centers and Retail he was to be honest he was too complex so the conclusion of this mistake was on the paper it was great the were great but it was too complex for for everyone in the company so I go back to that Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication and sometimes maybe you have the best formula maybe you have the best process but this process has to become as easy and accessible to anyone in the company otherwise what happened to myself they lost trust in the in the process in the formula because they don't didn't really understand the seties so they were all adjusting in the in the wrong way or they were not trusting so they were doing a lot of manual orders and we had to reust that after and that was that was a big lesson for me because we we lost a lot of time and money by implementing this and at the end the conclusion let's keep it very very simple maybe it won't be it won't have the same accuracy but at least it will be accessible for everyone so when you want to give access to more people only give a few options very simple and very easy to change and don't go into too much mathematics uh if you if you want to if you want to have a like a change management which is smooth and efficient for everyone so that was this mistak think about this one when you're going to implement and develop all these tools or you do it with a core expert team or you keep it very accessible for everyone
in this episode I'm going to talk about the stress management and especially my uh my burnout because you know what few years ago I was the director in a very big company had a lot of people and a lot of responsibility and when day I came to the office and uh I had pain and migraine in my body for a very long time and my time had one day had a meeting with my CEO and I cried in front of my CEO I I was playing The Confident guy very successful already is positive and one day my one day my body just told me stop stop stop pretending everything is okay and uh and I had to stop because it was it was too intense for me and uh and crying at the off was not a an easy thing to accept for my for my mind but for my body it was it was a big relief to stop pretending and everything was okay and I can tell you at this feeling uh and I wanted to go back to this one to conclude as well because we are all we most of us we are push to have the maximum performance and results all the time it's never good enough you we always have to do more and we look like we are always we have to do more in a very complex World very uncertain uncertain with a lot of uncertainty and we are all fire fighting basically when I was doing this survey in my in my webinars with thousand of people 85% of you look told me that you are working like a five fatter and 10 to 20% of you told me you are close to burnout so I know this feeling and I wanted to go back to few advice about this Obsession for performance because yes this is good to improve the forecast but for me it was never enough and at one point I burn out I was also in a very challenging time we were in know merging with proor gball and I'm not I'm not complaining about anyone in the company the environment was very intense um to be honest because we were like Maring thousand of people many people left the company we cannot we are no many people left the manufacturing uh plant so we had no products to ship so the customers were complaining a lot and basically we could not do much we had many different system lot of Excel and I still wanted to deliver 70 80% ofas accuracy 95% of service and uh and my mind could not accept the the average result basically so my advice to avoid that to conclude this course is also like this is okay like don't go burn out and how not to burnout is like first you need to measure and many people don't measure we talk about it if you don't measure your performance and your accuracy for example you and your ABC analysis for example for the most important products or clients you don't know where to focus so first you measure then you focus your energy and you have to accept that you cannot fix everything it's impossible to have 100% of accuracy on all the products always focus on the 20 20% of the product suppliers clients that will deliver 80% some of the result this is very obvious what I said but I I didn't accept that for a very long time and I was just killing myself my sleep because I'm want to do it always better automation is also a very important part to protect your time and your energy we talk about it a lot the more you will automate the Tas that are not relevant the more you will protect your energy and the more you will have also pleasure at work protect your time when I say protect your time I I was working 15 hours a day I had like 10 hours of meeting a lot of meeting to beess in because they were not efficient so protect your time by the fact like I was putting time in my calendar where I could not have any meetings because if you leave it blank it's going to the Natural doesn't like the blanks and it's going to be empty by useless meetings for example protect yourself as well with notification the the phone for me is the most powerful and toxic thing you have in your in my I have in my life so I need to detach from it when I'm working on this course I to work a lot to to make this course available for you and I was just leaving this phone away for a very long time with no notification not email on my phone no LinkedIn even when I was not publishing and there was something very important to protect my time for all this destraction and people also protect you from toxic people you probably have people in your company and maybe outside the company that drawn your energy and you need to be aware of these people and to protect yourself and don't expose too much to these people uh that's something also I try to you don't have to fight back but I will just be aware of this vampire of energy also try to educate first I was I educate myself a lot or to protect not only my time but my energy but also try to educate people around you for example to to explain why you you don't want to go to weekly meetings if if it's not necessary reply back when you don't want to be in a copy of so many useless meeting and also educate people in the way to do it in a better way more automated more efficient and more straight to the point so the more you will share also what you learn with me maybe share this this this class and maybe recommend it to other people around you that I feel that could be benef the benefit for you as well and for me the most challenging part was to detach detach from um Perfection I was a very perfectionist person to be honest took me five years to create this course so maybe I was too perfectionist still detach from the the performance we I always want more and I want point to get getting more can be toxic for the body and I had to accept to let go sometimes or even when I was in Australia I was very attached to have a permanent residency I didn't get it and it was very toxic for me or wanted to have 98% of service so the for me it's important to have ambitious goals and and Direction but not to be too attached to it same with money love Etc when I was too attached to my life it was very toxic I want to detach but I trust that it will come in any form that was that was more positive for me so Detachment is a big thing I can recommend you to read a book called The Surrender experiment for example you and uh that's from M singer you can check and also something very important is to disconnect disconnect from uh the work I would not recommend to stay too much time at work to have to plan stuff after work or before to make sure that you don't spend way too much time at work disconnect from the phone one more time from from the work from the everything and I was personally I love to spend a lot of time alone in nature when I can because this is something very very refreshing for me and for my mind and my body uh so at the end we we spend Maybe One S of our life working and the most important is to have fun and I hope you really had fun with this course I'm sharing all this journey about my relationship with my fears my blocks my even my burnout in other topics I'm going to share more on Linkin and I'm also I plan to publish a book and maybe to start another another online school very focusing on the on the the the more the personal development and the the balance between mind and body but just to give you an idea that was my initial expectation I wanted to have a positive impact I wanted to be successful and that was my reality my perception about the reality at least with a lot of events fears and blocks and uh and today I feel much more align I feel very align because I love education I love to help people I love to create stuff as well uh and I feel education is a big part for me and I start to share this more holistic journey to a on different format on different workshop with a a project called waves of life to accept the waves of life and I also spend a lot of time in the forest to reflect disconnect this is this is my way to to cope with all these ideas and and and stress that we can have in this in this world so thank you for watching this one I was a very special one but it was important for me to talk about this subject the supply chain of stress for me is is something I really want to cover the next few years and I want to I want to make it uh I want to try to have my little impact to make it more funny and and light for for everyone so thank you and and I see you for the next episode

to preparing for the Futures and at the end my last words for that is never stop practicing never stop practicing we were talking about with my friend Mario from Amazon like the more you will practice yes you learn with me but never stop practicing forecasting you can forus anything in your life from your personal finance to your business to to anything you can even take random numbers this the the sales cards in the US and and really don't never stop forecasting and and practicing this is the best way to to keep improving and I'm Not The Only One Of course as well that can give you a knowledge about this topic and I'm one more time and super pro that you you could make it and and uh and and yeah the next step is to celebrate we sometimes we forget to celebrate but this is a big celebration you learn a lot of stuff it was a personal investment in terms of money and time for you I do like to have a cant when I need to celebrate someone so celebrate for yourself but also celebrate with the people around you maybe your manager gave you this training maybe uh the person who help you to give access maybe to data from it to sales or finance that gave time for you maybe share your certificate and your maybe your new Excel tool to the people that really help you and share a big big croissant like this one with everyone I do love I do love croissant of course it's a big cliche but this is this is my my celebration U Shadow I will say at the end we went from Foundation to professional to expert and maybe you want to become and you're already a leader and you want to spread this knowledge and methods to to people around you and by completing you just have few episode The the next one are optional if you want to go further with me you can just validate also the bonus but you will you will be satisfied forecasting expert the next hours I'm super proud of you this certificate is super serious he was it was validated by the the French Republic for this way of teaching and coaching and it's recognized in in the entire world especially on lincolin so be proud of it share it to your network don't forget maybe to post on on your social network such as lincolin and don't forget to tag me at Edward T and ABC this is pleas then we can reply and we can also share it to our Network really this is not a small skill this is a main skill that will be very strategic not only for this year but for the next decades because the world is going to become more and more uncertain with a lot of change and uh and I can tell you you you not only have a technical skills you have a very deep skill that will really help you and support you for I hope really ups for the rest of your life now the last thing is I need your feedback because uh it took me a lot of energy and time and I was very passionate about it but uh that something that we would make a a big um a big pleasure for me is like if you can give me an honest feedback about what did you think about the metal what what what do you like what you did not like what is maybe missing maybe what is too much maybe I want a bit too far and the best gift you can give me because I gave my life I really sacrificed my life the last six months to make it happen I was thinking about it for the last five years but the last the last six months were very intense for me as you can maybe feel it and uh yeah if you could give me any testimonial on trust pilot or on my lincolin profile or share any stories or any feedback you got from maybe you got feedback from your management team maybe you got a raise or promotions maybe you want to share it with me on my YouTube channel that will be that would be a super super experience and that will also nourish me my goal is not to sell your course my goal is really to raise to give you more power deep skills that you can really uh give get more freedom more performance and more what you want in your life maybe a job maybe a raise maybe more freedom to take care of your family but at the end any feedback I will receive me and my team will be a will be a super gift for me so thank you for that now if you want to go further I already mentioned this multiple times we do have methods that you probably know already that maybe you're already part of it we're going to talk about it in the next episode but quickly we have Excel expert if you want to go further with Excel we have SM analytics if if you want to really understand the full supply chain not only forecasting all tracking all the performance all the indicators and create amazing dard that will really impress your board of director your manager and your clients and inventory management experts that will really uh connect with forecasting and the goal is really to improve the service and uh and reduce the Overstock of your of your company by 10 to 30% with real example using the same pedagogy that we use uh during the this course and we also have this idea to uh develop a new course called snop that works like to set up a simple and efficient SNP process because I was an SNP manager I'm coming from like scratch I I had to set up everything we talk about it in this uh in this course but the idea is to go deeper with the one who are already op manager or Supply share manager or maybe a project manager uh let me know maybe send us an email if you're open to reach we may open a waiting list if we have enough people we're going to do do it faster but at the end thank you so much for your trust and um we're going to talk about the deeper about how to connect with my other course just after but I wanted to congratulate you one more time
all right so now if you want to go deeper and if you are not already part of SM analytics this is my program to analyze and boost the performance of all your supply chain simply and automatically this is optional so you can skip this video if you already know my program but the idea is really to understand the full supply chain from distribution to manufacturing and raw materials and demand planning with all the kpis this is just few examples but all the kpis you need uh to really master and create your own amazing dashboards completely automatic that will have this wow effect so if you want to go deeper and connect with forecasting what you could do is we're going to learn I'm going to teach you how to create not only this but all these dashboard with the same style the same design I'm going to teach you how to really improve them for example you can see here we can see Focus accuracy from demon planning we have also selectors and the IDE is really to to give you all the tools and method to to understand all of it and to have a global picture of all this activities Logistics production distribution retail transport suppliers and of course we can still use as well much more advanced skills in Excel por Cy we also plan to do to provide an update with pobi so this is a very exciting uh very exciting course as well and the idea is not only about dashboard but this is to really Master a set from the capis select so select understand the supply chain select the kpi extract and clean data in a deeper way k calculate the kpi create the dashboard automating the dashboard analyzing we're going to spend much more time to analyze all the the big dashboard we have in the in the supply chain and operations and also how to manage and boost the performance in a more sustainable way I'm going to talk about also how to measure the impact on the planet and how to to animate the the performance of your team in a sustainable and very positive way so if you're open to this uh to this course you have the details below this video and you can if it's something important and new J for you let let us know and we'll let you know when you can on board with us for this new Journey
so now we're going to go to excel I'm going to also explain to you how to connect the dots between in forecasting experi and inventory management experi and make sure that you are we on the same page on these two okay so as you can see this is the forecasting exper machine this is the file we created together and I can tell you the structure of this file is very similar to the one uh we we're going to use with inventory manag exper so maybe you already have access to inventory manag Mar exper and you wonder oh what should I create one or two five how do I connect the dots or maybe you're just curious about inventory management expert and you want to know more about it so this is the file and this is one of the file this is not the most advanced one but this is one file we're going to create uh together and as you can see I'm using the same the same style I'm using also po query we have a bonus to explain how to use po query and we use the sales we use the stock we use the transit we have more information about the suppliers of course uh because this time we're going to focus also on the supplier part um with and we're going to classify the suppliers Bas on the level of uncertainty lead time Etc so this and we're also going to create a very cool dashboard and also what what to order uh if the orders are Urgent or not okay so the idea is like when you calculate the the Safety stock for if you go on to the right you have all this part based on Safety stock calculation and we have multiples weight to calculate the Safety stock but first before talking about the safety stock all the left part is very similar I mean we have more information regarding the suppliers of course but you could combine these two files into one unique file that will be the easiest way if you want to have all the information into one place all this part ABC analysis XY Z is very similar I'm going to tell you how to connect the dots if you follow the other course but as you can see I'm also getting the the sales of the last four weeks eight weeks 13 weeks we have the availability and then we have all of these so what you could do the best if you don't have too many would be to combine this file and this file into one file you just add new columns for example with suppliers and also with safety stock uh calculation or you you have two separate file and you connect only with the forecast when we talk about the formula of the forecast if you look at the the Safety stock for example or the REO point formula average sales the real points we use we you can use the r Point based on an average sales daily but you could also replace the average sales daily from the average of your forecast okay so if you have your forecast here if you on the same file you could replace your past average say by the average of your forecast in the future it could be the next 12 months the next 6 months if you have a more advanced tool you could also plug this forecast into your Erp and connect the dots to redo the the to redo the safety s calculation but this is completely okay to if you really want to enjoy this forecast it's better to switch from passels to forecast and use the forecast you just generated you can also use the the accuracy to update your uh XY Z analysis and that will be something that will work totally uh the only challenge you may have with that so I I I say that same for the safety story you could use the same standard deviation or same uh the same standard deviation that we use between uh the pale uh the only the only challenge you may have is if you have a lot of products these files can be a bit slower so I would recommend to remove maybe some um conditional formatting and maybe if you have way way too many products maybe to do it per category of product or per demon planner forecaster or maybe you do it by by plant if you have multiple plants as well so I think that's that was a quick introduction and uh I think that was a good point to start I think for me it was better to split inventory and forecasting because this is two very large topic if you have very short lead time you can keep it very simple with minmax and use the forecast only for the resource allocation for your warehouse for your purchase but not for the replenishment of your store and if you have very longly time these two files are very complimentary and I would MH them or you can also use por query to MH these two information in the same time but just to be honest like if you manage just to have a produ product range up to date is better to have everything into one place so if you want more information about Inventory management expert you can contact us below or directly and we will let you know when uh when you can join us for the next round and uh at the end I just want you to congratulate you one more time thank you for your trust and I wish you to have the best accuracy possible and the best level of inventory and service for your clients
in this episode my friends we're going to talk about how to use Google Trends the volume of research on internet to improve your forecast accuracy especially if you have for example you want to launch a new category of scooters uh for kids or adult you don't know where to start you don't know if you have to do electric for kids for adults what are the best brand what are the best suppliers and when you want to launch a new category or new type of products you have you don't have much information because you don't have any sales history and that's why I love to use uh Google TR for example uh to improve your to have more visibility and it's completely free so I'm sure you're going to really enjoy this video uh so let's take one example before talking about the schoolers uh you should all try if you never tried before this websy called Google Trends trends. google.com the first thing you have to pick is your country if you are sell in the US you're going to pick the us if you sell in India you should pick India I don't think you have any avability in China but that's one of the only country and then let's let's start with Co for example just to give you an idea of the way it works so you can see the country you can also select worldwide if you want uh and we're going to select the past well since the beginning 2004 and you can see there is nothing and boom in February 20 there is a huge Peck okay so what what is very powerful with this tool is when people are looking for something looking for information or looking to buy a products which is the topic of forecasting they're going to look uh for Google before even asking to anyone around them that's why we Google and all this big data company they can predict the future in a very accurate way because they know before everyone what people are looking for so when they're concerned about something or someone for example Michael Jackson Michael Michael Jackson Michael Jackson you can see the interest for Michael Jackson and it looks like something happened in the 2009 which was the death of Michael Jackson if he's really dead that's a conspiracy but at the end you can really see the the trend and the interest for that let's take another one and I really recommend you to play with that ice cream in the US you can see that people are looking for ice cream and you can see the same seasonal for summer than people are looking for Less ice cream in December it doesn't mean they're looking to buy ice cream online but maybe they're looking for recipe they but they have more interest for that so this is very useful if you sell for example main mainstream product like ice cream or bikes but it's also very useful if you do a B2B you supply for example um producer or seller of ice cream and you want to know in advance what will be the the seasonality of the trends of this uh of this ice cream so you you just have to pick the same you use the same data I'm we're going to be able to extract this data just after but you could say oh I'm supplying a pot for ice cream so I'm going to I'm going to move there is one monthly time so I'm going to move my peig one month before the one from Google because Google is more the the consumer U the consumer research not the B2B research so that's a very very useful topic of course if this is for example if you are selling a like very specific uh like product for maintenance or car I will it will it won't work for example if you talk about I don't know give me U what is something that is not very common in my life like for example ratat no ratat for sure people are let's see ratat it's the movie as well that was the movie but otherwi it's not very relevant to look at ratat sometimes you have to make sure about about the topic now you understand the this let's go back back to the uh the main one we want to launch scooters so we have no idea about this category I Will Survive company want to launch this new category let's have a look so scooters in America you can see that we do have a trend so what we have when you see this number 40 this is not about uh 60 people are looking for the number this is like a scale from 0 to 100 and you can still see the evolution of this and you can also see per country for for example in Nevada you have 100 this is not where you have the most number of research because in Nevada you have much less people than in California but in the proportion of the people looking for stuff on Google in Nevada you have more people the percentage of people are more interested in Nevada than in California but at the end the the biggest Market is in California probably in America but we don't have this information on how many people exactly are looking for that we're going to do that in the next bonus video and we're going to use keyword Explorer for that but I want to I want to stay with Google trans for the first one okay so we have these scooters we can see that oh it looks like electric is the first one Scooter Brown interesting um you have also the reality queries which is interesting but you can see that we do have a seasonality if I take only five years it looks very similar to bikes to be honest we don't sell much in Winter because it's raining and uh and cold and during summer you have you have an interesting pink now let's switch to Kids you can see that kid is completely different you have a huge Peck for Christmas because this is a very classic product for Christmas I was working for a spingus company called decathlon and we were selling 100 thousand of scooters every Christmas there was a lot so you can see that the seasonality is very different and we could use maybe compare now you can compare with scooter adults and you can see there is more research for adult than kids and probably even if you remove us adults you will have much much more for adult than kids that the first information is oh there is a bigger market for adult than kids but for kids there is a big pick for Christmas so I only have I have to make sure I have avability and my forecast and my seasonality is ready for Christmas okay so that's a very very interesting topic so you could by doing this you could also compare and say oh I need to buy more more of adult or more of kids in this way oh sorry I was wrong adult is less but to be honest for me adult usually when you want to buy a scooter you will not mention adult you will just say scooter and when we do that we can see there is a ratio from one to 40 so it looks like there is 40 times more research for other than for kids so if I have to focus on the category or maybe focus on adults first but let's say you know what I want I have have kids in my family I want to keys for my for not only for my for my I don't have keys today but just one example maybe one day I want to focus on the scool keys because this is a strategic category for us so let's remove this one and now let's use this data and and let's use it in Excel so what we're going to do we're going to to the full history from 2004 to present now we have all this information and you can see that there is a trend looks like people are looking for more scooters nowadays than a few years ago so there is a positive Trends on the market and there is a seasonality uh that we want to catch the idea is really like I don't know if you remember or I hope you remember we working on the L of seasonality but this time we have a new category called SC called scooter for for kids and we want to have the same calculation with the percent the basis 100 what will be the basis 100 for scooter for kids because we don't have any sales history so we have to use it for example from uh Google and we could also do the same job for the trend we could create the trend and the seasonality based on Google anal on Google Trends okay so now let's go back to this data and what we're going to do we're going to download this data tck I'm going to open the file this is a CSV file and what we're going to do we're going to transform first this into a t a table right so I'm going to select this all right I'm going to go to insert table okay now I do have a table great so now I'm going to maybe insert a graph just to see how it looks nice so you see I didn't pay anything to Google and I have this for free then what we can do and this is a base 100 it will never go up to 100 you do you can go right click add a tra line great I'm going to do like this so we can see we have a positive trend line and we could use it to say all this if you use the same calculation than before you say use for example the TR 12 months go back to the trend module if you want you could say oh there is a for example 10% plus gross Trend every year based on the research on Google which can be very very accurate to be honest okay so now we have a Dr but I want to know what will be the seasonality so to create the seasonality I we need to have the months uh of this this is not the month so I'm going to do like this I'm going to create months okay okay maybe I have to do like this Mount okay CL and I can also select maybe the year like this so what we're going to do we're going to create a left you know the formula left to get the year first number four up and we're going to create Mount so right right two perfect now we have all of this which is great what's happening with this oh yeah I don't like the color of this one cl to fix my graph I do it live no cut freestyle the line I'm going to change the line to solid line like this I like this blue nice and my trade line was like this red okay great but I want to have my seasonality so how to create the seasonality what we're going to do it's very simple we're going to move this and I'm going to insert a new pivot table from Ranch exing worksheet and I'm going to put it here okay now I have my pivot table and what I'm going to do I'm going to just put my months okay and my score this is my Google score and you can see there is more there is more score for this for the end of the year there is like clearly more demand for in December than January and instead that could be for me it could be like a revenue or turnover you could and we can we can to use it to calculate the seasonality what we're going to do we're going to create another one like this up and this time we're going to do the average right average there is no value for average month okay yes because it's not the months it's the score I'm going to call it Google score let's refresh I have to do it again t two and this one I'm going to do average okay so I do have my average and I can see there is more demand but what I want I want a percentage of this so what I'm going to do I'm going to I'm going to remove the average or I'm going to I can create another one if you want up and this time I'm going to do the average but I'm going to go to show values as percentage of ground total boom I know I do have my percentage of seasonality easy we can create a conditional formatting CL I know this is what we want if we want to have a seasonality we just copy and paste this clack we have this we can also maybe draw a shart or something like this like this up select data yeah I cannot remove this one but just to have an idea you can see now the seasonality in percentage and in I'm going to click here and what I'm going to do what you can do is you can remove this one and this one I know you have your percentage of seasonality okay seasonality seone it is scooter kids scooter perfect now we have the trend we have the seasonality and we can just if you have for example my focusing exper file you go back to the file and you create a new category in seasonality let's say you just copy and paste this one and you just copy and paste the value and boom you have your new seasonality for scooter in your file which what exactly what that what we want for uh this specific tool so you can see using Excel uh is very useful with Google Trends as well you can extract all the data don't forget to save this file as because this is a CSV file so move it to excel workbook uh call it whatever you want to call it and just recommend you to explore maybe your this data won't be relevant for your industry but try to go back to the consumer product the main the main product behind maybe if you have a if you're a car supplier go go back to electric car and always Focus I was talking about the bull whip effect really try to get what is the original demand from the consumer in the supermarket on online etc etc so enjoy this tool and the next one we're going to go deeper with volumes of research using paid tools to have more information to improve your forecast accuracy
in this episode my friend we're going to talk about how to get information from Google but in my previous episode we are using only the score of Google from Zer to 100 but we have no quantity what is the volume so you can always compare the the two categories for example oh there is a twice more research between for example kids and adults but you don't have really the number and for to get the the full number you need to pay you need to pay so you have multiple way to pay you can if you are already using for example if your compan is already promoting some stuff on Google ads uh you can have information from Google ads directly I don't have example for Google ad today or you can pay a specific tool for example I'm going to show you how to use this one I don't I do not recommend one specifically you have few on the market but you have today multiple tools to be able to have what we call they call it seo seo for search engine optimization tools to have what are the volume of research from uh from Google of course you could you have new tools coming from like CH GPT and we'll have much more source of information but you could get information from Google Amazon YouTube CH GPT maybe one day uh and that's that's how you you get more more precise so what we're going to do now you have I'm going to give you a list this is one of the article I recommend you can also type on Google because this list is ching A Lot SEO tools maybe free and just see what is the first one Sam Rush is a very famous one all in one I don't know this one ashre is the one I'm going to show you you have you most of the time you have a free version for seven days so you can also use it for seven days and just get all the information you need and then stop it usually you pay around $100 per month which is not a big investment if you want to forecast for like hundred thousand of millions of dollars of product improving paying few hundred to have more information to improve your accuracy can be very very profitable and when I wasp manager or director I was recommending this tool to my team and to marketing for example before launching any new products for example when we were doing a I was doing cosmetics and the marketing team wanted to launch Cosmetics for men in Australia and I was looking at the number and there were basically no research for that so there were no market and interest for that and we use this tool to stop this project to make sure it was not a problem of inventory after that so now I'm going to just show you one tool this they're all the same basically uh and this is for example we're going to go to keyword Explorer we're going to go to keyword Explorer and you can see you can choose the room of research from Google YouTube Amazon Bing Yahoo or even like Buu interesting we do have BYU in China very interesting and for example let's say Okay scooter nice in America so you can also select the country and this time you have much much more information okay you have much more information I don't want to focus on everything but you can see that us is the biggest Market with 15% of the research in the world in English of course in French we're going to call it trotinet but this is another name and you can see a lot of information the compet the difficulty there is a competition but let's let's focus really on the numbers how many people are looking for scooters right so you can see that the number one is electric scooter with 200 so you can see the average monthly number of search it's it's a lot 200,000 people in the US only are writing like typing in Google electric scooters which is massive so if I want to launch a new category of scooters this is the first information I should definitely start from Electric right then you can see scooter number two and number three can see Razor scooter and razor scooter is a brand of scooters right I'm not an expert but um when you do Razor scooters USA American scooters manufacturer great made made in America you can see there is scoters for family and for adults so if I want to if I don't know anything about the market and this is great say oh this is the most popular on the market then the second one is Bugatti Bugatti and let's say for example let's click on Bugatti and you will have more information about okay okay what's happening with Bugatti Bugatti scooter Bugatti scooter you can see that then it looks like Costco is doing a promotion because many people are looking for buget scooter at Costco which is the one of the biggest retailer in America etc etc okay so this is a very very interesting topic let's go back to um scooter if I want to launch a product it's always good to have more information from what are the the most topic for example you have this one called KN scooter so if I go to KNE scooter this is pretty big this is 15% of electric less but I didn't know there was such a big market for n scooters like this is this kind of scooter for when you have you need more Mobility so this is this kind of knee walker scooter I guess knee scooter and there is looks like in America at least there is a big market for that and maybe that could be part of your of your products you want to you want to sell next year in your company and you already have an idea of the Global Market at least 36,000 people in the US that's a lot are looking for scooters and maybe if you have a 10% market share or you you want to Target 10% market share that will be uh this is research not buy so you have to be careful between these two but you could see really there is a topic for that and maybe you can also combine with Google Trends and let's say let's focus on KN scers you can see there is also not much seasonality compared to the other one [Music] remove remove yeah we you don't you don't have a big sity of course during Co I was different but there is a big trend for that and since 2018 the market is pretty flat on this specific topic okay so that's another example oh why not KN scooters and I don't see kids you see what you have electric then you have razor which is a brand and kid is pretty small so let's go back to scooter kits if I only look kits I can see that there is electric scooters first so there is more research for electric scooter for kids than skid scooters so it's also very interesting if you do like 20,000 and 13 you have you would definitely if I was you I would start with electric ones because they is I would do like for example 20 divided by 13 I have plus 53% of research more plus 50% more research on electric than normal so that give you another information and then from all this information you can start improving your forecast as well and for example you say okay I'm going to start with electric schoolers for kids there is 20,000 research U maybe in this 207 I don't know I'm doing I'm doing a very quick calculation I want to Target 5% of it so it will be I'm going to go back to this file let say this is my sionality and I want to Target for example 5% let's say that the global market is 20 this is not sales but just to give you an idea I want Target 5% of my market so that will be this time this per months to 1,000 and then I will do my forecast like this this so we do I'm going to zoom a bit maybe only half of the person looking are buying so I'm going to I'm going to divide by I'm going to do 1,000 / by two that's my hypothesis and then I'm going to do G4 time 500 and that would be my number I'm going to fix that t t t and I do have a very very very of course I want way too fast but just to give you an idea if I want to to sell in average per month 500 that will be wait I think I'm going wrong with that I was wrong in my formula CL like this forecast clack that's my forecast CL I do have 500 Target monthly I do have my target is 500 per month and I I will have to sell 1,000 in December and only 281 in January thanks to the seasonality of Google Trends so I hope you like this example I want really fast but you can compare many many categories you could also compare for example shirt Woman white I was giving this you can also compare for example you already a woman short white maybe not the best example shirt white like white white shirt you want to compare white shirt versus blue shirt white shirt so you can see the white is 32k and now the blue shirt I'm going to just do like this 6.7 so you do 6.7 divided by 32 there is only 20% if you are to sell blue Shir or you could also add men or woman but you will be a you will say five times less blue Shir than white shirt if you want to start selling like overall in terms of research on Google so you have this kind of volume that will really help you to tune and improve your forecast it will never be perfect but the more you will deep into that and have information the more it will be easier for you and if you are targeting a new complete category whatever your business is I will have a look and see what what the market and what Google and all these big data company are doing you can also do it for example with Amazon which is less accurate to be honest I've try with Amazon this is not as accurate but I can try oop scooters you can see that on Amazon apparently in the US electric scooter is the number one then you have the brand Razer knee scooters etc etc KY scooter is 5% of electric scooter with 5.6k versus more than 100K so I hope you like it I'm going to put some link you can check on Google as well uh the best free SEO tools they not really free you can try for a few days and then you have to pay or you don't have the full information Brian is a Dean is a good friend so I hope you will you will enjoy his article and I see you for another bonus
all right welcome everyone in this uh bonus with Mario again hello Mario we're we're going to talk about we're g to share we're going to share with you may is going to share the way thinking analyzing and optimizing the forecasting process and I think it was it was really cool to use this sh flow view to uh to really show you the way Mayo is thinking the brain his brain is working is much much more powerful than machine learning and also also to recommend you maybe to have this kind of approach to do your own sh flow analysis decision and optimization sh flow so we're going to Mar is going to explain what is it what is the the way is thinking and maybe I recommend you to have your own process after after that you can also download this sh flow below the video uh but just to give you an idea before we uh we're going to start with having a forecast we have a flow for automatic forecast and we have a flow for manual forecast and once you have all of it then we're going to focus on specific group of products but the first step before all of that is Mayo what is the what is yeah the first step is is to have a forecast for an automated forecast for all products yeah okay well to have a for first of all I have a forecast for all products okay I'm not saying manual or automatic but yeah having a is the first step because having a forecast is way better than not having a forecast yeah okay so even a bad forecast is better than not having a forecast okay so my first suggestion is to have a forecast for our product even though it's even if it's manual okay yeah simplest case it could be like given an a I would say before average average sales 12 months yeah me just just you know uh uh next week demand equal uh previous week demand yeah yeah Ultra simple it's just way better than nothing okay okay um that's the first step uh the Second Step yes is um um here I I distinguish two cases okay uh first case is someone who already has some automated forecast or generates forecast with formulas or algorithms or models okay and the other case where all the forecast is generated manually by by by by people okay so if if all the forecasts are generated manually by people you can still improve the forecast okay it's just you basically need to improve the policy okay so if there is one so create a policy or improve the existing policy okay so creating creating forecasts so just to be clear like you don't have any automatic forecast the idea and we teach you how to create even in Excel very quickly an automatic forecast but let's say okay before you have this automatic forecast you need to have a strong policy of override like it's like when you drive you cannot drive to 400 miles per hour so what are the main pillars of your policy yeah these are the most obvious one I mean it could be countless but this is the most obvious one that you know I think it's easier also to uh uh set up uh so yeah first first of all you can authorize the creation or the you know the override of the forecast only for certain products okay certain categories or you know you can you can uh uh uh slice it and dice it as As You Wish okay um you can also restrict uh the the rights okay you can give rights only to certain people okay or you can also remove revoke the rights okay to people who for example have a poor poor accuracy okay have had poor accuracy in the past example the sales team who has really like or it could be specific people in the team if you can track their accur I think pointing to specific is often better it's often better uh because um removing revoking the rights of specific people often Drive the remaining people to be to pay more attention be more careful of what they're doing fear by management by fear yeah it's just knowing it's just knowing that you know they they have uh even if nobody has time right uh everybody has many to do so it's just to say that you know if if they don't spend at least a little bit of time they can puts in danger okay it's just a way of reminding them okay it's a a bit of accountability uh bring the accountability much faster than just in a year time someone is going to yell at you because you know you create a very bad uh accuracy so you just do it like very quickly okay automatic right yeah yeah yeah definitely yeah um what is isn't train users you say train users of course of course you need to train users uh uh you can do it internally you can do it you know with the courses like this ones you can check my you can check I did another video about my mistakes at Deaton I gave too much power to too many people in the company and they had to change the seasonality and it was too complex so it's important to train user but only leave them leverage that are easy to use and not complex otherwise it's going to be a nightmare check my other video about that uh yeah limit the forecast overrides per user per category so you can put like boundaries guard rails uh uh like the maximum number of products they can override or uh the maximum percentage change they can uh uh they can override uh the maximum number of quantities or value uh they can put in the system things like this uh and then you can always also erase or modify the overrides either automatically or centrally okay so even though the overrides are already created by the users okay or the manual forecast let's say it's already created by by the user uh you can always alter it modify again on top of it okay you as a central planner or us a model you can have a formula or you can actually delete it if you have like a default automated forecast you can also delete it just simple delete the override created by the person and by and the the the system forecast is going to take over from there so for examp like the most obvious things you can do yeah for example at one point he was it was a mess and I was the SNP manager and I was reducing all the sales forecast from the sales team by 30% because they were always over it was very basing but it was uh it was basically my BS my BS with Sal F was plus 30% so okay I don't have the time for now so I'm going to reduce everything by 30% this is very brutal yeah you can do it you can do it uh uh one shot like maybe you did but you can also do it automatically okay you can you can with a formula okay you can put a a a a a rule for example every override uh created more than three months ago I I estimate is obsolete so I have to delete it okay so you can you know of course you before doing this you have to make some analysis just to double check that that's the case it's it's it improved accuracy doing this and then you can do things like this okay so now we have to process for all the manual how to improve the manual override but let's go back now okay now I have this process but let's say you have automatic forecast let's yes say you have automatic forecast and you leave uh so yeah you have two cases here either you have automatic forecast and people cannot override the forecast so in this case what I would suggest is to seriously consider uh how people can actually add value to the to the to the forecast okay maybe give them you know the OB obvious uh uh um uh solution is to give people some um Power to modify the uh um the forecast okay do you you can also do you think human we have a future as a human to improve the forecast or the the machine yeah I think so I think so I think provided that you you you give specific boundaries okay specific limits okay uh in general humans do add value okay do add value because because we always have information that the machine is not aware especially in the real Mo forecast okay okay um and I think it's going to stay like this for for a few years few years like a few years yeah I don't know I don't know 10 years i' say okay nice um then uh yes so I suggest really to consider like how the user can contribute I'm not saying just give every user the possibility of changing the forecast just consider it okay maybe some user can do you know good to the forecast okay and how they could best inter okay okay um once you have that you can then you can measure what you should do you should measure the accuracy of solely the automated forecast what we what I call the system forecast okay yes exactly and then you have to measure the accuracy of the what we what I call the final forecast which is the forecast after the changes that have been made by people okay so ideally you want the uh forecast uh updated manually to be more accurate okay uh if that's not the case then please consider improving your override policy so you go back to this if if you go back to what we said before the policy if if people improve the accuracy of the system okay yes then good job very well done I mean you can also improve it even more that's that's always a possibility uh but otherwise you can move that one step forward and you can um when uh one one simple way of of improving the uh accuracy is to um is to improve demand what do you mean by that adjust demand so you have to the the number one input of any forecasting model is pass demand okay that's for sure so if you have a lot of out of stock situations your demand doesn't make much sense okay so it's very difficult to have an accurate demand yeah if your pass demand is is is is not accurate because you were out of stock it doesn't represent like the real customer demand okay because you wear out of stock often okay so if it was the if you wear out of stock very often then you should consider to create what is called an adjusted demand so you have to take the demand for example uh let's say you sold five units last week but you were out of stock 50% then I don't know you have to come up with certain rules or you need to build a certain model to estimate how much you would have sold if you didn't if you didn't if you weren't out of stock okay so maybe you would have sold I don't know 15 units okay maybe I don't know um yeah if the out of stock it's it's uh marginal uh it's not really impactful for your business maybe you can just avoid this process because it's very very uh complex and it's very difficult to get it right okay so you might do more arm than good uh yeah um we talk about it the 5 95 it really depends on your industry of course and I explain also how to correct automatically in the in the previous episode this but I think it's important to consider that as well and finally we're going to the last part of the process you have an automatic process with override with with r rules and policy what are the next steps yeah the next step is is I mean of course you always have the possibility of changing like the overall model you're using for forecasting you know for forecasting your selection sales for the entire selection it's a c of an extreme case so I wouldn't go I mean I don't think it's uh it's fair to put it in here but it's always something you can do I just uh wanted to uh to say uh what it's easier to do is to focus on particular groups okay of your selection those who are particularly inaccurate okay of course it's not easy to identify those groups but the most obvious culprit like those who generally are less accurate okay are I've just put a few things just to have an idea like seasonal products new products uh products with promotions um High very high selling rate very low selling rate some specific categories some specific topics yeah you know things like this okay um yeah you have to know a bit the selection to basically uh uh figure it out okay but I'm pretty sure there are like groups of products who are particularly inaccurate okay so once you did that you can intervene on those specific products in three different ways so the simplest is to better tune your forecasting your existing forecasting models very often all forecasting models have some sort of parameters okay so you can try to tweak the parameters optimize the parameters tune the parameters to get better accuracy okay so for example class specific group yeah for example I was explaining oh we need a specific seasonality for the we're going to create a new seasonality group with a different pattern or it could be a for this specific group I'm going to use the last 12 month or six months instead of 12 so it's a the same model but different parameters right or lead time or or just coefficients maybe the model has just some abstract coefficient that don't mean anything you know oh maybe maybe just yeah pampering with this maybe you can improve the ACC okay yeah I mean the overall strategy is always to try to do something and then measure if the accur improves yeah okay and then yeah the other option is to um add new inputs mhm okay to the model the existing model okay so this is also something you can do um like obvious you know add more product attributes more historical data view clicks marketing spending if you have a marketing campaigns or promotions um yeah Events maybe some products have specifically reled to some um U uh events during the year like Christmas back to school wi sport tournaments these are the most obvious one social media trends maybe some items are very fashionable or they're driven by uh social media there are very good uh yeah there are very good things that can be done here uh and the News okay like U often related to artists you know books stuff like this um yeah and the last option which uh it's it's yeah it's it's it's I think it's the most impactful one is to create an N do model okay for those specific groups okay from basically from scratch you can it can be a can simple as a form it doesn't have to be complicated uh if the products are kind of simple it can be as simple as a formula okay uh if or if if this complicated it can be very sophisticated a very sophisticated algorithm okay or you can actually Outsource this to a an external service so for example for me uh in the in this big retail company uh sping company uh we had we created a model which was okay for most of the product but it was not working well for fashion prodct products you know like very shortterm life cycle and we we create first we we could see this forus accuracy analysis just in this group oh Focus accuracy for fion is really bad so we try to tune the model first and then realize no we have we have to create a completely new adoc model and uh then in the in the system was if this is a fashion product then call this other program which was completely different from the the other one and I guess this you say right yeah even if we have very sophisticated algorithms like we we had at Amazon uh artificial intelligence uh algorithms um you can always improve with this specific uh strategy okay um so yeah even like for example like a many company not considering uh uh legal companies you not considering using a AI model specifically trained for legal uh purposes okay which in theory like the generic model should do as good as the specific one but in practice we I don't know why it doesn't happen Okay so specific mod is always better okay sometimes a bit better sometimes a lot better okay so it's always something is worth uh investigating I think yeah I think this is for me the the end end of the proc and that was your job at Amazon to uh do all of this create specific group and really deep dive into this specific model but at the end what is really important the conclusion of all of this for me is like you start from the foundation first the basic first you have a forecast then you make sure that all appr the forecast then you make sure that you have a very simple automatic forecast you start to improve the quality of the forecast by overriding but with very clear rules to make sure you don't you don't uh uh you don't create too much noise then you add more complexity with for example the stock out correction and once you have all this automatic system which will bring you already 90 95% of value then you can focus on specific groups to even more value but I'm sure when you do a specific group at Amazon it's not it's not $10,000 it's like few hundred millions of dollars at least for a specific group so it's profitable as well for for you because it's a it's a big business for for now but for if you have a smaller company for sure I will keep this last part for for the most advanced one but most of the most of you will probably win from that and I also recommend you to create your own flow shart analysis maybe much simpler uh to make sure that you also have this in mind and it's also a great way to teach new people in your team demon planner forecaster and you will be able to also download and have inspiration with this specific one so thank you Mario for sharing your your brain one more time and uh I'll see you for other episodes
in this bonus episode we're going to spread the forecast so because we have the forecast per month with the forecasting file we do have a forecast for like August September November but if you work in logistics for example or production you you need maybe more detail you need to know exactly which day on Monday and Tuesday how many quantities I need to ship or maybe for the production you need to have more details when do you have to produce to adapt the capabilities the components and the recruitment in uh the factory or the warehouse so how to do that most of the companies they redo the forecast from the beginning which is a big waste of time once you have all the information into wine F whatever it's per week or per month you have all the promotions you have all the new products it's it's it's too bad if you have to redo the job one more time for your warehouse for your factory etc etc so in this episode we're going to go much deeper into how to spread automatically the forecast first with very like simple I mean with Excel formula and in the next episode we're going to use por Cy to do it automatically for thousand of products not only per day for Jeff Bas and the Jack machine you can see like here we have for every day we have the quantity we can see that we don't plan to ship or to have any quantity during the weekend because they do not work on Saturday and Sunday we're going to consider as well all the PB holidays you have in your in your country or region and in the next episode we're going to also spread not only per day but per week so whatever your you have a forus per week you can use this principle to to split by day or you can also um do the opposite you can consolidate your weekly first into daily and then into monthly if you want to consolidate per month so the goal of this uh two episode is not is not a I'm going to show you the way you could do it this is very Advanced that's why it's optional you can you can validate this episode without watching it because it is very specific I'm going to go much deeper with Excel formula and this is just a direction and we know we're not providing an automatic tool for that if you have an Erp that could be automatic but this is just to give you directions of what you could do uh but we are not going to custom all this file one by one for you it's just like a way to do it and get inspiration and do it find your own way and if it's too complex maybe go back to my Excel course before going back to this so now let's get started what are we going to do first we're going to first talk about the the principles how to split the forecast okay you can enable this content the first thing you need to have is let's say we want to switch from month's forecast to daily forecast the first thing you need to know is like for example you have a retail company and you need to have what is the share of every day every week share of week uh based on the demand history analysis so for example in this specific company you just take all the sales or if possible demand but all the sales per day and you just just do pivot table what is the share of every single day like we did for seasonality per month you do it per day to say like in average my Thursday is 35% of the week in average my Monday is 25 and my Tuesday is only 10% okay so you have to do your an analysis base you need at one point to have data you could be like the shipping quantity in your Warehouse could be the the production quantity per day in your factory but you need to have an average per day and if you want to make it even better if you have you could you should maybe remove the week with public holidays to avide like for example if you have only I don't know you have maybe a 52 Thursday but you only have 48 Wednesday because they wear like Wednesday is this one because you had a lot of public holiday but at the end you need to have an average and like in in the retail for example Saturday is always the biggest month not the biggest oneth the biggest day with 30 to 40% of the quantity of the of the of the week and Monday is always a very slow month okay so this is just an example but this table is very very important uh to make base on your daily data history all right then this is just an example and then we're going to spread it auto we're going to do it in a larger scale but let's say we have this specific months starting on Wednesday the we the day number one then you have a public H Day Day 16 and then it's finishing the 30 and it's a it's a Thursday okay so this is um the very classic example and now what we're going to do we're going to count how many days do we have without public holiday so we have four four five two four and four four and four okay so this is the number of times that we have Monday Tuesday with no public holidays great then we're going to calculate what is what we call the day share and to have the day share is just like it's a very simple formula you just have to repeat what we do the idea is really to P array to say I have 100 it's like the the seasonal I have 100% or 100 points to give for every for the months and I want to have what what will be the the score per day the average weight or share or split per day so for that before going uh week by week I just want to have what is my uh average share for Monday and from Monday I just get my 25% here share of the week times 100 divided by four the number of times I have Monday in the specific months but for every month it can change because you can have public holid dayss and you can have a week selling on Monday or not okay so 100 if you use in percentage you don't even have to multiply by 100 but just to give you one IDE I use it like this but you could also use percentage and if it's percentage it's 100% so you will have the same okay so at the end just to give an idea we could just switch this into let's do like this it will be easier to understand 100% And like this like this great easier to understand this way great so now we have the uh this is the average of my Monday in average with based on this specific 6.3% this one 2.5 and the biggest is Thursday we do have 88.8% and then what you do you just give the same number for like Monday it's 6.3% for all of them Tuesday is 2.5 you see so the the overall is 10% for one week but based on the number of day with no public holid day or no it could be public H day but it could be also a closing time like exceptional closing time except from uh from this one because this is z and zero you can add zero and zero that would be the same so at the end when you have this I could when you have this you can see that let's do like this clack you have the average per per day per week and we just repeat the same way but sometimes you have a blank you have have zero because you have a public okay so that's the rule of this this is the principle now we're going to apply to a larger scale not only for one one specific month but for for example one or two years calendar okay so try to if if I'm going too fast just try to make it more like try to understand what I'm doing here and if it's too complex maybe come back later when you feel you really need that okay but the most simple one is to have the share of the week for every uh single day then we go back we're going to get all the Pu holid dayss I just take one example from the Pu holid day in California because this company is based in California and you just you have multiple website to get the format just try to get one that give you uh a date format that you can use in Excel okay so you have multiple website for that but you put it in your calendar you can even use powerquery just to let you know that's a trick you can get data from uh internet from the web and in this specific query if you follow my online course on Excel you can just put your an URL and you can get automatically the public dat from a specific website it can be very useful if you for example have a business in America and you have aot many region and you want to have the Pu per per region per like per state not per region okay now we do have all these P days we have this new calendar dates so how do we do that we do that we need to have the month's date we need to have the date we need to have the date per day and the months the months in in between so this is for example August T te we have 31 days and I want to know okay I want to have in August all the days in August for that I need to have a starting date this starting dat is the r date what is this R date it's coming from another time I'm going to show you that with power query this is this this is the beginning of my forecast so you could do that with power query I'm going to teach you in the next episode or you can do it manually just press equal and you go to your focus file and in the focus file if you remember my the start date is my M plus 0 and you can see here my start date is bm7 it's 8 like in this specific because it's the the 1 of August okay so now when you have this you just all you press equal oh no not in this one or you do um equal to the the other file or we use proy and we're going to use that later once you have your St dat you just add plus one for every single day and you just add you can add one or two I just put like two years calendar but you could put even more if you have more more forecast than that okay then you have the mon start and for that I'm going to just use the formula date year and months and just to uh just to get uh the first day of the month so one as the number day I don't I just want to keep the first day of the month okay so I have my month start and I have my day this will be able with this I will be able to link with my forecasting file which is always telling where is the first day of the month right hey the 1 of August 1 of September etc etc okay perfect so we go back to my file then we have the day of the week so for that we have used the formula week day and in the week day and return return type we just press two okay so if you don't know what is two uh you can see Sunday and if you press two it's mon Monday is equal to zero okay so for this specific one this is the way sometimes in in some company um Sunday is the first day for other company Sunday is no Sunday is the day number seven you can check on Google or CH GPT or co-pilot if you want to know more about that then we need to know what are the Pu holidays the Pu holidays are uh basically it's just a vup and I just say if there is no if I don't find it I just put blank if there is a public just put true so I just look up with this tab and I just say if I find it I say okay true means that in this specific date the 4th of uh September there is a public holid day it's the Labor Day I think let me check yes the Labor Day in California all right now we go back to the file we do have the pr day I want to have the months so I get the months month number eight then I go I do the same principle and before I I want to know how many Tuesday two is Tuesday how many Tuesday do we have in this specific month so we for that we use the formula count if you can check the formula slowly but I'm going to check how many count if so count how many times do we have the day number two in this specific month 8 minus how many uh public holid days do we have in the month so I'm going to Red I'm going to remove all the public holid days because in this specific company we don't work when we have public H days okay so at the end I have the count of working days in this specific company and we're going to remove Sunday Saturday and Sunday in the next colum okay then I keep doing it we have the day share of the week the day share of the week is just the percentage of every single day and for that it's just a vup of the day of the week and this specific just this simple tab so this time is very important and we say okay if I'm on Tuesday I have 10% if I'm on Friday I have 35% so I go back to this you see two 10% Friday 35% okay and the last colum is the day share of the month's demand I just do the formula so I just do if there is a pu than zero if otherwise I just do the 10% divided by the number of times I have Tuesday so 10% divided by 5 I have 2% and this is the same formula that we did before this is this specific the day share I do I do four no not sorry I do 25 divided by the number of the day okay and that's that will give me my my share and then I can spread the same value for the same the same day of the same month with the the the the where we check if you have do we do have public holidays or not so this is quite Advanced but at the end we have exactly what we want we have the percentage uh per day for these specific months if I check the full months of August t t t t t you can see this full month of August I have 100% o I have 100% so what I'm going to do is that is like the seasonality before by month I'm going to spread my forecast B on this percentage and you see I have a different ratio for every single month because I don't start with the same day I don't have the same public Day rules etc etc so now just to conclude let's say I want to do a I want to take this is the electric bike I'm going to take another product t t Tac I'm going to take for example this one the kids uh kids bike the kids bike you see there is a forecast of 651 651 for M plus 0 m plus 0 is August right so I'm going to spread this forecast per day how to do that I'm going to just do this I'm going to go back to my file and I'm going to do 661 so 651 times this oops is times that means that the first day of the month I'm going to sell 13 quantities and then I'm going to do like this I'm going to block yeah that's correct no like this number like this and when I check the total I have this is my forecast per day I can see that I'm always close on every weekend and my sum will be the same quantity so it's going to be 651 so this specific value and and I can do it for every month okay t t if I create the shart you can see this is my forecast per day forecast day for kids bike I forgot the name of the bike okay so that's my daily forecast split by day and of course you can do it for all the products this is kind of this is very manual why because I have to do it for every month so you could do a VAP of the you could do a v between this information of the the months so eight and the daily share that could be if you don't have many prods you can do it in Excel directly but now what we're going to do in the next episode I'm going to I'm going to show you how to split automatically not in Excel but also with powerquery to make it very very efficient because we do have a lot of products with a lot of rows so if you do it on thousand of products it's going to be a bit complex to to align so maybe this is enough for you I really want to make sure that you understand the principle of the the day ship uh for every single day you can also do it per week we're going to do it in the next episode you can also add directly the weak number in this tab you can insert the colum and say this is my you use the formula weak number but in the next episode we're going to go deeper and that's what we're going to do but if this is enough just start with this rules
okay so now let's do something more efficient we do have the the split per day but it's kind of manual with the forecast and I have to do a lot of v c or index match now let's go to the next level and let's split the forecast with pory to have this full table and in this table I have 90,000 rows I have my monthly quantity and I have my daily quantity and even and even have my week number which is pretty cool right I have all of these and then we we'll be able to do a daily shart with like very um if I want to see on electric bike boom automatically I will have my automatic forecast or my flying bike my kids bike you can see that we will have the spread automatically this is very Advanced to be honest but I want to show you the direction if you're ready for that if you're not just have a look or maybe just complete this uh this program this is not mandatory to become forecasting expert so what we're going to do now once we have all of this we need to use power query so power query is very useful you can go to queries and connection and we do have base calendar R date and this one I'm going to delete this one that was for the previous episode okay so we have this three table the first one we're going to get is calendar how to get the calendar I need to have this table into Power query because it's going to be more efficient like this so what I'm going to do you just select your calendar dates you go to get data from file uh not from file from other source and you just say from table and wrench by clicking this you can connect your powerquery even in the same file so you can see calendar two I have my table great so I'm going to remove it because I already have this one but I have my table okay this is my table and then I can connect I can um connect with another table then what do we need the second thing we need is the base so what is the base the base is my forecasting file the base from my forecasting file so this specific file you remember I need to have this and we have uh uh in this file I'm going to get the forecast and the starting date of the forecast okay and all the these categories so I'm going back to this and and you're going to just go to a file or if you never done that before you go to new source file Excel workbook you're going to you're going to call the forecasting file and I'm going to just you can see there is a lot of steps this is quite Advanced I'm going to go just one by one if you have of course the first time you download this file you will have a problem with the source of the file because this file is on my laptop so what you have to do first you need to go to data source setting to fix the problem and you need to select the source to where the file St I recommend you to use the file from my course because if you change any colon it's going to is going to it's going to just lose it because you have to you have to make sure have the exact same colum for the forecasting file so the last file we use in the course was the forecasting exper review you can select it if it's not the case okay and sometimes you have some uh permission issues so okay what's going on edit permission yeah H What's Happening Here I know I think I know why it's because my file is not this card I need to close this file don't save okay I know we're good to go okay so now we sometimes you have to close the file I don't know why this is not very convenient but make sure you have the the right Source then what we do just do the navigation in when you see when so this is my forecasting file you can see we have all the the information from my forecasting file base sheet and the first thing I'm going to do is this I'm going to go to the my forecast and automatically I'm going to get up okay automatically you can see I'm going to get this specific you know this column I want to have what is my starting date of my forecast and you can use a manual formula or you can do you click on this specific one because this is always the same column you do right click and then you can just click add as a new query by doing this automatically the colon 65 you can call in you can call it ra I call it ra date ra date 2 you can you can use you can see 8 of August that this will be automatic every time you're going to update the file you're going to get this information inside but you can also uh you can also go to close and load and if you close and load you will we have automatically this stying date and that's the stying date we use I use the same for we call it R date this is the same date and that's the one I used for my stying date in my calendar tab you can see R date this is equal to just this specific table okay so very useful you can use also powerquery to define the specific parameters in my Excel course I explain to you how to get automatically the exchange rate between euro and USD which can be also very useful if I go back to my base so I got now automatically my my R date to to have my starting point I'm going to delete this one then I go back so to my navigation I modify um I modify the this colons then I delete uh I just delete the if you look at it I just suppress the first I remove all the first rows then I I multiply I don't know why it's in French but I remove a few columns I basically I unselect a lot of columns I don't need and at the end I just keep all my forecast from M plus 0 to m + 12 m+ one and I just keep it it categories and sub categories then I just promote the the eer so the eer was promoted oned promium me I'm going to put the eer first like use first row as eer then I just modify the type to make sure it's all numbers then I just suppress I just clean and suppress some colums and then I add some conditional formatting for the conditional formatting you can press this this is quite Advanced I told you I say if attribute M plus 0 so if my colon is M plus 0 then I'm going to use the date add months I'm going to just keep the Rev dat plus zero months okay so that's a formula you can just copy and paste if you're not comfortable this is a language for power query then if it's equal to m+ one you can just copy and paste the this Row one by one if you are lazy you can do like this but I'm not doing it like this if this is m plus1 i do you use my current date plus one months if this is m plus2 r date plus two Etc Etc so at the end I will have I will translate M plus 0 into what is my uh what is my date okay what is my date I press okay yes I don't want to change anything then I have my new um I have my new personalized date which means that M plus Z means August m plus1 means September then I rename I call it month start then I just filter I just remove all the blank does not equal to blank n then I modify the type to say this is a date format then here I'm going to I'm going to merge I'm going to merge my base and my calendar date and my link is my month start and my month start by doing that I will be able to get in my base the information I need I need to have the most important is what is my day share of the month from my table okay so then I'm going to expand and get my Daya of the months then I'm going to suppress I'm going to suppress the Dasa of the month no I'm going to suppress the the information I don't remember what I suppress yeah I think I suppress this specific date then I'm going to personalize I'm going to create like um a new color name called I'm going to do the the value of my forecast so for example the forast was 90 or something so I'm going to use the forast monthly 89.5 times my day of the month so what we did in Excel 90 times for example two or 3% which was my day my day share of the month for every single day okay so I have my I have this then I'm going to suppress my Das sh the most because I can keep it but I don't I don't have to display it in the table then I'm going to modify the type and then I'm going to rename to I'm going I call it daily quantity so I did and it's a lot of Step but it's pretty fast when you get it the most the most difficult was to connect M plus Z to say this is August and then when we have this we have the forus we have the date and we have this is the monthly focus and this is my daily quantity and once you have all of it we are ready to go so we have the monthly and the daily you could also include another colum to say oh this is my weak um I could also create a weak forecast directly to this tuab uh but let's do it in Excel directly and then you just close and load to have this table when you close and load I'm going to discard you have this beautiful table you have this beautiful table and this table you have everything you need you don't even have to display the table you can do pivot table directly I just wanted to show you the format so this is I have my forecast I have my date I have my daily quantity and I just add another one manually called a week number so if you do a week number yeah you have just the week number because we can convert daily into week because if you want to move from months to week it's it's much easier to go back first to days and then to have uh the week number to to generate your weekly forecast and once you have that you just press insert pivot table from table wrench let's create a new worksheet and we can add sub for example category and sub category filter I'm going to add my date here here I'm going to remove all of this and we going to do daily quantity like this T tac tac number so by having this with Pro query we we have now I have my daily quantity B which is pretty cool you can remove this uh marker none no marker options none solid line green back and now we do have the forecast per day for all of it and you say no you know what I want to see my uh electric mountain bike and I have my focus and the maximum is like 30 27 units I want to see for example my flying bike you can see you can also have only the new product so it's very very powerful for example you Logistics and you say you know what for me logic it's not about it's not about the the the category for the business about like the type of product so I want to have all my uh road bike mountain bike flying bike and electric bike because that's like voluminous like AV products and I want to have all of them for Logistics and this is great so you could create your own category in your base or you can also select the category you want and this is now for Logistics the quantity per day with considering the closing date like Saturday and Sunday but also the public day public holidays and at the end you have this automatic forecast which is really really cool right so I wanted to share you that and if you want to do it per you can also do it per per week if you want to do it per week you just do another pivot table from table and rench you use the same base and this time we're going to do it per week so we do week like this daily quantity and the category and for example if I want to see my I want to do T this is my weekly going to do like this going a bit fast but just to have an idea now I have my 52 week spread which is nice like this or like this and I want to see for example oh you know what I only want to see the closing part you know what I want to see only the winter part so I'm going to select winter winter for men and wom what the man winter tck and now you can see there is a huge huge difference if we only check these categories and that's what you can share with production Manu manufacturing Logistics Etc Etc so I hope you like this uh this bonus that was very very Advanced but at the end this is just to give you the direction of what you could do from having as the most important is to have one unique forecast respecting the standard format of the company most of the time it's monthly or weekly but then for all the department that need more details you need to find an automatic way to spread the forecast without having to redo all the forecasting process and then you can put more res more resources on the the right forecast for everyone and then having a process to spread it Amazon is doing this as well they do a week day and weekly and monthly and they just spread automatically and that's one of the the process you can also apply in your company so I hope you like it and I see you for other episodes
