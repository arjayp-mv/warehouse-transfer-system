### Analysis and Fixes for Critical Issues

Here is a detailed analysis of the form submission and CSV import issues, along with the specific fixes required.

#### **1. Form Submission Issue: API Call Not Triggered**

**Analysis:**

The "Update Status" button in the Stockout Management interface does not trigger an API call to the backend. This is due to a logical error in the JavaScript within `frontend/stockout-management.html`.

The `submitUpdate()` function contains the line `if (!validateForm() || validatedSKUs.length === 0) return;`. The `validateForm()` function, however, does not return a boolean value; it returns `undefined`. In JavaScript, `!undefined` evaluates to `true`, which causes the `if` condition to always be met, making the `submitUpdate()` function exit before the `fetch` request to the API can be made.

**The Fix:**

The fix involves two changes in `frontend/stockout-management.html`:

1.  **`validateForm()` must return a boolean value.** The function should return the `isValid` constant.
2.  **The `if` condition in `submitUpdate()` should be simplified** to `if (!validateForm()) return;`, as the `validateForm` function already checks for valid SKUs.

#### **2. CSV Import Issue: `name 'uuid' is not defined`**

**Analysis:**

The CSV import process fails because the `uuid` module is not in the scope where `uuid.uuid4()` is called. This results in a Python `NameError`.

While there is a global `import uuid` at the top of `backend/main.py`, the error's persistence suggests that the running server process is not using the most recent version of the code. This is a common issue when a server does not automatically restart after a file is saved.

Additionally, a separate bug exists in the `undo_stockout_update` function, which also calls `uuid.uuid4()` without importing the `uuid` module.

**The Fix:**

To definitively resolve this, the following changes should be made to `backend/main.py`:

1.  **Confirm that `import uuid` is present at the top of the file** to make it globally available.
2.  **Remove any redundant, local `import uuid` statements** from within functions to ensure consistency.
3.  **Add `import uuid` to the `undo_stockout_update` function** to resolve the bug in that feature.

After making these changes, it is **critical to completely stop and restart the `uvicorn` server** to ensure the updated code is loaded.
