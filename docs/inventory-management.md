[Music] hello and welcome to my new Inventory management expert course I'm very excited of this new version it took me more than a year from the feedback to my members to the creation of the new tools to create this version so first of all thank you for your trust I know it's an investment for you or for your company and but my goal is not to sell your course my goal is really to push you to the next level so I really want you to improve fast your inventory level your service and also the profits of your company and obviously if you're an employee today to boost your career because that was for me a very very strategic skills all along my career so let's get into it quick because I know you don't have time you probably have way too many emails and meetings uh even today probably so what we're going to do we're going to go step by step the challenge for me is I can go very very deep into complexity but sometimes complexity is not the best so what we're going to do and just go back to this graph maybe you know this graph from my last webinars or or conference but the idea is really to go step by step if you don't have any parameters if you don't have anything to optimize your your inventory like algorithm or models at the beginning you will see it's quite simple it's quite simple to improve your performance but the more you real like complexity and parameters I'm going to get back to this the more you will be challenging and the more your performance will at one point start to stabilize and you won't improve anything and at one point like I've been working with a lot of different comp companies Industries and I was working with the MIT at one point it may even crash if you had too much complexity into your inventory optimization so that's why my goal is to go step by step 1 2 3 4 10 parameters and at one point I will tell you you you will be able to know okay this is enough for me I can already reduce my inventory by 20 or 30% on my service and when you get ready maybe in the next few weeks or few months you can add more complexity and also tools to improve the performance of your supply chain okay so we're going to go step by step the foundation level first we're going to start with a simple dashboard with the most important kpis ABC classification we're going to start with a real example with a minmax minmax tool to really start optimizing already and ordering automatically your your your products and we're going to only use Simple parameters I can tell you that even most of the companies don't have the right Foundations at today even like famous companies I've been working with hundred and thousand of companies over the last 15 years and I can tell you that the foundation level is already much much better than most of the companies because some companies they want to go directly to complexity and maybe machine learning for example but because they don't have the right foundation everything crash and their performance is really really low then we're going to go to the professional level we're going to get back to Safety stock different methods EQ economic order quality we're going to focus on the demand uncertainty the supply uncertainty and I know for you that that's a tricky point right now and I'm going to go back to the XY Z method ABC XYZ method so more more tools to improve even more your performance your skills your expertise and to boost your career then we're going to go to the expert level the expert level I'm going to share with you a real Consulting example and I will explain to you how I reduce by 21% the inventory of this company within 6 months and for that I have 45 steps so you just have basically to follow my 45 steps and I'm going to give you a full checklist to make sure that you can apply the same principle you don't even have to apply all these 45 side that's a lot but just to give you the the full spectrum of what is possible to do and you will see most of them are so simple but so obvious sometimes we don't do it and I'm going also to show you I have a lot of bonus how to present your projects if you're a project manager if you're a demand planner if you're a consultant or or do I present my my action plans to make sure that we improve the performance of the company and the last one is have a lot lot of bonus and the more the more this program will evolve the more you will have bonus bonuses to make sure that you can even go deeper into that so how how do you manage like Crisis management like for example your demon is dropping by a lot or you have another stock situation you are you're in a financial crisis and you don't know what to do you need to to have act very fast I'm going to show you a lot of benchmarks case to this I designed a new forecasting tool that will help you really to ruce your forecast quickly and I'm going to show you like for example the setting commandments so I have a lot of tools I have a lot of methodology to to share but it's very important that you start from the foundation to make sure you have the right one to go next next to the professional then expert and eventually to enjoy all the bonuses of these programs okay so we're going to go step by step I'm going to explain to do all all of this you don't have to understand everything today sometimes I will go a bit too fast it's okay my idea is really to show the full potential but even if you use only 20 or 30% of my knowledge you will be much much more better than probably most of the companies in the world because this is a critical skis but most of the companies and most of the people and experts don't use it and they keep it they keep adding more complexity and Reporting but they don't really go to the point to make sure that they have a simple and efficient Inventory management policy so I'm very excited for that and I'm going to show you all these parameters the idea the end is to master all the first 13 parameters we're going to go to the end if you are if you're interested but I this read you go step by step to make sure you go to the next level but even if you have one experience or 15 or 20 years experience this is the same approach uh to get to the point and to become an expert with me okay so what something what is really important as well is I really want to push you to go until the end of this course and I know you have a very busy life with a lot of priorities and you you are probably working like a firefighter like me for many years and what is really important is you have access to this program for one year obviously you can finish this program in only few weeks but I can tell you that if you finish this program I'm going to give you an extra four years for free with all the updates because I really want you to go until the end of this program because I know the benefits for you for your company and for your career so please trust me go until the end of this course and you will get reward you get an extra four years access with all the updates and I have a lot of updates coming and trust me it could really change your life because it really these skills really changed my life and my career and also the way I live thanks to this very important strategy skills for for me and for my career so let's get into it and I can't wait to see your progress with me
okay so before we start why Inventory management is so important and still underestimated I start with that because I really feel that most of the company they still today don't take these skills very seriously and this is so important for the profits and the cash flow of a company so first of all inventor is everywhere you can see that inventories starting from the suppliers the raw material to the procurement and souring to the production to the warehouse and transport to retail e-commerce or B2B business to business if you sell to other companies and you so have all the process of return and recycle is going to be a big challenge for for for the next 10 or 20 years for sure because this is quite new and we need to improve that and also all the demand planning and snop is managing that so I've been working with most of this most of this uh Fields over the last 15 years but most of my time I was in the demon planning and SNP and my job was really to coordinate all the inventory to make it as efficient for the company but also with the best service possible for our customers and I can tell you that inventory is everywhere and it's it's impossible to know the real value but just in the US just for retailer and wholesaler we're talking about two trillions dollar2 trillions dollar and 90% of this inventory is stationary but that means that is not efficient this inventory doesn't produce any value for for the company so that's a lot of money that's a lot of cash and I think my approximation will be that we have at least 20 trillions of inventory in the world but it's really hard to get a number and all this money is not basically sleeping because we don't do it properly another thing like you can see like everywhere inventory is everywhere we need inventory we have stationary inventory that is not used to do anything just in case we have more demand just in case we have a supply issue and at the end it's just an accumulation of money on cash that we don't invest in something that really produce value to the consumer so that's something very important and when we talk about I I wanted to come back to what is a profitable supply chain to have a profitable supply chain you have three main pillars the first one is service you need obviously why do we have inventory because you want to supply products to a customer whatever is the customer and the service is most of the time we're going to go back to this with very very good example service rate avability rate it's also the number of products you're going to supply sometimes we have too many products I'm going to get back to this uh the lead time the quality and the flexibility uh for your customers then you need to balance that with the cost you have the cost of purchase the transport the storage the it the number of employees working because also people are working to make these products available and also the inventory cost and this inventory cost is most of the time underestimated by a lot and the last one is the cash is we need to have the best service with the less cost and the the less cash invested and most of this cash for a company is most of the time the inventory that we're going to invest we're going to use the stock turn stock turnover inventory turnover and basically that's the working Capital that we're using to make these products available and the IDE is really to find the balance between this this these three if we really go back to what is the main goal of a company I was talking about this in my SM metrics program but just quickly we call that what is important for company above profit is what we call the capital employed or how much money we're going to invest and what we get in return it's like like buying a flat on property you know you want to make sure that you invest as little as possible and you get the best return uh regarding to the investment you've done at at the beginning okay so the most important for any should of the private companies is to improve what we call the capital employed or the return on Capital employed and for that we need to improve like the profits that we get we call it most of the time a bit and the capital we are going to invest then below if you want to improve the profits you need to have the the biggest Revenue possible with the lowest cost on the other side for the capital employee you need need to have as little stocks or inventory possible and you need to have as little other also other Investments for example if you are deploying new Products Research development etc etc and below that you have a lot of intermediate kpis like avability rate service rate lead time blah blah blah you have the all all these cost Warehouse transport it I was talking about this before promotion is a cost as well if you do Black Friday for example uh inventory and the cost inventory is a cost because if you have to D destroy products because you do a lot of promotions or you have too much stocks in your wouse or you have an expiry date and for the stocks you have of course finished products components raw materials you also have the payment lead time that will impact your how much you have to spend for your inventory and for the other Investments you have a lot of examples if I show you that is at the end with all these K all these kpis and metrics we have service cost and cash we do have strategic kpis and we have operational kpis and we're going to get back first to the strategic then to the operational and if you're an investor see your directors will really care about the top of the pyramid if you're manager more in the middle and if you're in the if you are working for a team you will really focus on the intermediate one that will supply and make sure that the top of the pyramid is as efficient as possible and I can tell you that those to the inventory will impact all of them it will impact all of them this is one of the most important and if you don't do this properly everything will crash and your company will may go to bankruptcy if you don't do it properly and in this time it's very important to make this properly okay so the idea is really to find this balance this balance is to be honest not easy to find and this balance is different for every single products I'm going to give you a lot of tools to make sure you can you can find it or get close to it but yeah if you have if you don't have a good service it's easy to have to not have too much stocks solid days of stock for example on no profit but on the opposite if you have too much inventory but it's easy to have a good service but the really the the tricky point is to avoid as much as possible what we call the yo-yo effect you have too much you stop buying you don't have enough you stop you you do the opposite etc etc during years and months and this is this is the classical cycle for most of the company in the world and we can see this yoyo effect per company per groups of products and per products okay so the idea is really to get back to this and I can tell you that most of the company you probably should saw this graph from my my previous webinar most of the company they they decrease their level of performance regarding inventory even if we had so much Technologies and Innovation coming with big data machine learning AI even if we had all this Innovation most of the company we can see like for example all these industries over the last 15 years their level of inventory is increasing the level of inventory is increasing and when we check like the inventory turnover for example from 2012 to 2020 we have the same level we are not improving anything which doesn't make sense in a way because we had so much information and data to help us to do that because yeah it looks on the paper it looks easier but it's not it's getting more and more complex and most of the companies are declining in terms of inventory level but also I mean in number of days that it's getting worse and the operating meing is getting worse as well so most of the company in the world I in the situation is getting more intense and with the the inflation and the recession is is getting very tough for most of the companies so at the end if you don't want to go to bankruptcy and I can tell you many companies the next year are going to bankruptcy because they don't take this subject seriously my go is really to help you to find this balance per produ because the strategy will be different per produ I'm going to show you that and I can't wait again to see your products and I see you for the next video
in this video I'm going to talk about my story how I became an inventory management expert if you already know my story I've been sharing a lot recently you can just accelerate or go until the end I don't want to waste your time but I feel it's important to get some inspiration or I became an expert so this is my my journey my journey is still still moving from warehouse worker training working in a late in the night doing inventory check stock stock Tech until consultant entrepreneur and and coach today and I was that was a beautiful journey and exciting Journey where did it start starting from in French so as you can feel I'm French with my French accent I hope you can cope with that I'm from a City close to bord named Sant milon santon is quite famous for for wine but I was not really involved in the sulation of the wine and my dream was not even to be part of the sulation at the beginning I just wanted to explore and I didn't know what to do so I went I went to the north of France in this region where you have much more rain but amazing people and because I didn't know what to do I did a master degree in engineering Logistics and suppli Sh at the end and I also did a master degree in business and project management and my first connection with inventory was to do a stock Tech at night for this supermarkets it was like it was basically one of the only job I could I could I could do and I was so shocked at the at this time by the the poor accuracy of the inventory in supermarkets and most of the time it was less than in the it system and I was really surprised by but how the system will work if the inventory is always wrong and this company was still spending a lot of money to pay 100 of students like me uh to do the job at night because it was critical for their replenishment then yeah during my my master degree one of my teacher in inventory mment so I had for me I was so lucky I don't have a picture of him but I had an amazing to be honest I didn't really learn my my my skills at school uh I I didn't become become an expert at school but I had an amazing teacher in Inventory management called agen Miller and this person was really simple methodical and this person gave me this book called the goal and I really recommend you to read this book if you want really to keep it simple and to the point from Jeff Jeff Cox and this book really gave me open me the do that okay it looks really complex in the company but at the end it's very simple and basically if you want to improve the performance and inventory management you have to keep it very simple and methodical and just observe track improve and measure and improve again that's it so I really recommend you to to read this book my second experiment was to work in a in a small Factory not a small Factory in a big mediumsized Factory we are doing like uh part for energy plan and Nuclear Station as well and I was so surprised by the poor level of inventory measurement as as well so by implementing just few methods a mini Maxi and few KPS I was able to improve to double the performance of the of the inventory level and also to improve the service for the customer because we had a lot of delays at this time then at the end of my study I had the opportunity to take like one year one Gap here to to work in um abroad my dream was to go to Australia but I didn't make it and that's another story you can watch my YouTube videos if you want but I end I end up in Malaysia next to koal lumur for this huge Factory from the company electria and this company is basically the number one in what we call copper wires for ey Technologies cars and um Aeros speciaal and my goal was basically you could see this Factory you say okay this Factory is probably it's a German company they have processed but at the end the inventory management was so basic it was two people doing a lot of manual operations the Erp and Microsoft Dynamics was not very use and everything was manual and not optimized with way too much inventory and not the the right quantity for the right products and my goal for the for it took me eight months is eight months to make this um to create a file who will first give the real performance of the inventory and the service and to create orders automatically based on service service level goals and it took me eight months because it was very difficult for me to find the right information even with all these German engineers around me I feel like Inventory management was not the best documented process especially with on books and internet but after eight months I was so happy because the the the team was only they just we just had to extract one file from Microsoft Dynamics click on one button and everything was created automatically to optimize the inventory so everyone was saving time it was much easier to have visibility and these two these two people could do something with much more value they were not fired because the it was just manual operations for for nothing so it was for me was a game changer because I really realized okay if this big billions if this company was making more than two billions of Revenue is not optimized I guess that most of the company in the world are not as well so when I came back to France said okay I was the that was the the crisis in 2008 2009 uh my my first dream was to become an expert a Trader like in the in the finance Market because I'm quite good with numbers but at the end okay this is not maybe this is maybe a um a sign that I I really have to keep into Inventory management and supply chain because uh in the finance Market this is not a right right move to go to this uh to this worldall so at the end I do this opportunity or to join Consulting companies or to to join Deaton Deaton is the number one spoing goods company in the world no it's they are quite massive they have more than 2,000 stores and yeah I the support between Consulting and this company and to be honest the the project with this company were much more exciting and thanks to my first experience with inventory management they were looking for someone to automate the replenishment of all their 2000 stores then their warehouses and to be honest you don't have much experts on the planet for that and they really trust me and I trust them and it was a it was a beautiful connection I could really feel that this kind of projects will help me to scale up and to go to the next level even if I I was not an expert yet so they gave me this huge responsibility uh of course I was not alone but I was the one who was responsible to find the best way to do it and yeah I just follow my my gut uh the conting company was paying me like maybe 40% more in Paris but I say no I have a good feeling this company I was passionate about sport this company was also fast growing it was a family business long-term business and I say okay let's do it so I joined this company and I was an amazing experience because I had to basically all the products you in the in the stores for example I was responsible to say okay how many quantity do we have to what is the best quantity for this t for this uh jacket for these bikes is it 1 two three zero and I was I was my goal was to do that because I was not an expert again to be honest I I didn't Bor like an inventory management expert I had to find the best expert on the planet so I just Google it and I found that the mat was looks looks like they were the the people who know about Inventory management and I was lucky because they they were they were big fans of Deaton because Deaton is not really big company if you're in the US we they standing slowly but in most of the world now they have huge market shares and they also have very very cool products and so I I started working with the MIT and it was it was an amazing experience because the I was working directly with the research director of the supply chain lab and um I was amazing because they were working the same time with Amazon and Zara and I I could we were basically I was working with them they were giving me okay you need to try this this year this week you need to you need to try different models and at the end I was sharing the results and it was a huge learning curve for me and at the end what what I got from this experience is like it's it's good to it's very important to improve and to find the best model but at the end the Simplicity is key and I went way too far in terms of models and um and parameters I will get back to this after once again but at the end uh the more it's comp the more it's difficult to implement and the more it's difficult also to train the team around you and at the end the key is to keep it simple and as automatic as possible I'm going to share more stories about Amazon and Zara later so that was an amazing experence I really became an expert then I became responsible for the the the replenishment of of the 50 warehouses in the world uh so I became very young very fast like the the the inventory management expert in this plus 20 billions Revenue company and that was a that was a huge move for me at at the end after three four years of projects di me to move to Brazil to develop this beautiful country so I moved to Brazil as an expact I was very young I was like 20 26 27 after I started working at 22 at 26 I was unexpect that was a beautiful experience I become a supply chain manager and I was also responsible for all the projects related to expansion and of course inventory was one of the the key uh key factors because in Brazil the inflation and the the cost of money is much more important so it was critical for us also because of the leate time to improve that as much as possible and I really had a lot of fun with this is my team in Brazil I was a very young manager and was a lot of learnings from this so I was my first my if you go back to my experience first of all I was I was my job was to become an expert then my job was to share uh this expertise with my team because it was impossible to do everything by myself and I really learn and I became passionate about education and that's one that's one of the reason that if today I have this ABC supp as school okay so then after that I took a sabatical leave I wanted to take a step back say okay what I'm going to do is my life so I travel for almost one year I was practicing for Iron Man and the race was in Sydney it was my dream to move to to Australia so I did this race and during my trip sing this blog uh this blog was French speaking first it was G M this is in French but this blog was about inv just literally means Inventory management so my blog was like inventory management.com but it was not in it was in French speaking at the beginning and my T my title was less talk more profitable okay so I was really into this m okay everyone says I'm an expert I'm going to share that because I was very frustrated about the content I could find online and I starting to to share that I also decided to stay in Tri was my dream so I said okay there is we have only one life so let's do it but it was quite difficult because the the immigration policy became quite challenging it was the at the same that Trump got elected and basically they we were not welcome anymore to stay in Australia so I really had to find a job to be able to stay with a good visa and my focus was I was targeting like mediumsized and big companies I say okay I was I was sending this email as this connection message on lincol in and say okay I'm going to reduce your inventory by 10% and I was really sure I could do it because I've done it a lot and for example with just the catlon I've reduced the the inventory by almost 200 Millions Euros just by implementing one new model so I was quite Confident by that and in only few days I found a job my job was at the beginning very simple I had to it was a cosmetic company called CTI who was maning with Pro Gumble with 45 new brands and my my goal was just to keep it very not just it was to keep it simple and make it as automatic as possible by doing a lot of excel because this company had GD and sap but we could we could not do anything and that's why it's very important I'm going to use a lot of EX Excel example to don't wait for this new Erp version or software version to do something you can already improve your performance with changing your system and that's what we're going to learn uh for the next few few days is to make sure that you don't wait and you implement tools as fast as possible you get the performance uh you improve the performance and you also boost your career so for me it was really fast starting from the the back door I was the Excel Excel magic expert doing Automation and after like three or four weeks I became the snop and and Demon planning manager and after a year I became the supply chain director for Australia and New Zealand that was a really really fast um a fast move why because I had the expertise and the the skills expertise could also share it because I was good at teaching and sharing to everyone it was a very it was quite tense in the in when you have a merging situation most of the time you have a lot of noise you have a lot of issues and the more you can teach and and and share what you what you do the more in a good and positive way the more the more efficient this is for for you and for your career so in the meantime I was commuting every day and my my French blog became a and French speaking and English speaking blog uh this is where I was I I was working 10 to 12 hours a day that was very intense for me I was call had calls between China and New York during the same day but I was commuting 21 minutes every day in front of the Opera house so I was doing this blog and this sing also doing this YouTube videos so that was a beautiful experience to be honest I don't consider myself as the best expert on the planet but I feel like my my my pedagogy and my my way to educate is quite different I like to keep it simple fun with real example and that's starting being inviting U invited by different conference uh to share my my knowledge and my my view of the superation world because I feel we need more we need to keep it simple and fun and our jobs can be can be very excited but we have to take a step back from all this pressure and firefighting jobs okay so I starting doing your YouTube videos first in French then in English to be honest at the beginning I was not comfortable because I was not English speaking born and uh but people I got very good feedbacks from you so I'm very grateful that you you trust me and now most of ABC became a big we we became a like a big player in the education in dis well and I'm very grateful you can trust me as well so this is this is for my my journey from war worker to entrepreneur today what you have to remind what you have to remind from my from my Journeys I didn't plan everything in advance but I was I was always obsess obsessed about about learning new skills about automation because I'm some I'm very lazy in a way I don't like to repeat anything and I'm always obsessed to optimization and how to get how to do it faster simpler and better but the key of this is find the right projects to improve your skills there is you're going to you're going to follow this course you're going to practice with my data this is this is great because most of the time when I was learning I no example and this I'm going to give you a lot of examples but I can tell you that the best way in the same time is okay whatever is your position in your company or if you're an entrepreneur find projects whatever is your projects to start implementing this skills and it's like I was in Malaysia I no Anya what to do but by by having these examples you will find the the way and I will give you the structure to make sure you can go step by step so that's it for my journey my journey is not over I'm going to start improving this I'm going to start expanding the ABC community and I hope you can give you some inspiration to to go as to the next level
okay so now the real deal is or you will become an expert too okay that's that's the goal of this this methodology is how you you will become an expert and you have to come back to this and this is critical The Compound Effect we can use it for money but you also have to use it for your skills you have two kind of group of people you have the one who will win and the one who will lose and the one who will lose are the experts and top performers and the other one are the one who will be passive in their way to improve their performance and Implement new tools and methodologies why what is very important is for me you have to remember something consistency is key consistency is key consistency is key my main difference with most of my friends at school is I was I was not yes I was working at one point a lot but I think the main difference for me is I was always consistent in my way to learn and to improve I never say okay no I got it I don't have I can chill for the rest of my life I always challenge myself and say okay or I can get one 0.1% better every month even 0.1% better every month if you apply it for 20 years you can really go you can improve your performance 120 or 200% and most of the companies world I can tell you we have a lot of competition with a lot of jobs will disappear because thanks to to automation a lot of middle management position as well because I don't feel we need that level of management we have too many managers and directors and VP in this company and I really feel that we will have a huge gap the Gap will get higher between the person who can really become top performer and become like like a unicorn and they can in the same way understand the complexity implement it and transform the companies and the rest will just do repetitive task and at one point you will have a lot of competition low added value stress and low salary so my goal is really to help you to go to the winnner pass and no uh be too impacted by the next 10 years because we're going to have a lot of trouble for a lot of jobs especially in Supply CH because most of them for me to be honest can be automated or can be at least reduced by 20 to 50% okay and there is no secret if you want to improve there is a part of your you have for me two situation the first situation is you have you are working like like a firefighter every day you have Wonder in my position at 200 emails every day at one point which was insane uh too many priorities I was like over overwhelmed most of my day and I did a burnout a few years ago when I was Supply CH director because I was also too attached to to the results so that that's another story but you have this situation or you basically you are overwhelmed and you have the other situation or you are chill you on your life maybe a bit too much to be honest like in a way like you spend a lot of your time relaxing doing uh social media Netflix or all this kind of stuff and at one point I don't say you have to stop everything I just say that you what I was saying before consistency is key to only invest few hours a week to improve your skills and just to go to the next level and most of the the people on this planet they wish they want to have more money they want to have this promotion they want to have this job but at the end they don't they are not consistent and they're not honest with theel that yes if you want to go to the next level there is no magic potion it's not like crypto investment you're going to do plus 500% automatically if it was easy and we had nothing to do everyone will do it and I think the main difference between top performers and the rest is they know that consistency and focus is critical so what I'm going to tell you is it's very important that you lock learning times in your calendar it's very easy to join me when I open the doors I don't open the doors often for my for my course but it's easy to join but you need I really need your commitment to um to go to the next level with me so lock times in your calendar and during this specific time you could be only one two hours week if you're super busy or but I really recommend you to if you can do it three or four hour is better if you are like a supply chain director you really don't have time even 30 minutes a week or you have no distraction no email no phone and you are 100% focused on that you can maybe do one episode every day like it's like a 10 minutes episode five minutes episode but at the end that will that will be the main the main difference between you and the rest we say oh I wish I could do it but I don't have time you know what I'm very tired and blah blah blah at the end if if you feel that you have have too much work to do I recommend to do it in the morning before you open your email because I feel I was always really overwhelmed with my email because the one I can start seeing others priorities I just lose my focus and I feel like during the day you have three three three moments you have the time for you the time for your business if you have a business if you're for example a consultant and the time for the others and most of the time we start with by spending on energy for others we receive an email we rece we receive a WhatsApp we start helping them but I really recommend you that first help yourself spend maybe 30 minutes every day on yourself it could be for business learning skill but also take care of yourself like stretching doing some sports and then take care of the others people but don't do the opposite okay so it's very important first of all as you L some learning times I really really encourage you to do it to right now so you you pause this video and you say for example okay every Tuesday morning and Thursday afternoon I vog 1 hour and going to learn with Edo how to improve my performance okay and maybe Saturday if you're really busy during the week so do it now pause the video do it now great thank you and the other one why why have to you have to look in your calendar because then people cannot invite you as well so please do it now and then the next is practice as much as you can you need to Pro you need to I told you in my previous video you need to have a problem to solve you need to avoid repetitive if you have something that is very repetitive especially in the order management you have to fix it and this is a great project to implement you need to find anything to simplify could be data CLE cleaning or cleansing automation you don't have to be perfect and you have to do mistakes to correct them I see so many people say oh I don't have the right data my data is not accurate so I'm going to wait and that's a big mistake it's better to improve something at 80% than to do to wait for Perfection Amazon is really good for that for example if the bizos was always saying if you you they wait 80 to 90% of the information to take the decision they don't never wait for 100% of the total information otherwise they will never be that fast they will they will never expand that fast as we know Amazon today so do it and I can also tell you that you always have multiple solution you don't have one absolute truth I'm going to give you multiple solution but for example in Excel you can use the old school way with V cover you can use the new new way with power quy I'm going to give you a lot of example be just simple and try to focus on the outcome at the end what is important is the results not the way you do it it could be simple reliable and understandable because also it's important when you create something it's easy to share because you don't want to do that for the rest of of your life so keep it simple creative and it's going to be an an amazing journey for you as well refuse repetive task I've done that before but that's that was I think one of my superow is like because I'm super lazy I don't like to repeat and uh I was always the guy who was like making things automatic especially for replenishment and I can tell you like I told you that before by completing this course you have only one year you have one year access you can complete this course in five days if if you're really committed but in few weeks uh most of you will complete this course in three to four weeks um I really want to encourage you to finish and because thanks to that I I'm going to give you four years if you finish this course if you are certified inventory management Within the first year I'm give you four more years access with all the updates for free because I really I want to give you another reasons to go until the end of this program maybe sometime I'm going too fast it's not a problem really my goal is really to you to see the full picture what is possible and then you can get back to this in two or three or four years when you feel you are ready to implement for example the expert level the the step number 37 etc etc so enjoy have fun and now we let's go into details how to improve your performance with inventory management
in this video I'm going to explain to you how to get satisfied and extend your access because by being satisfied you will have four more years access to ABC Supply Chain in Inventory management expect all the updates and all the new tools that are coming so you have no excuse not to be satisfied uh basically how to do it you need to complete all the videos and you need to complete all the quiz the quizzes you will you will have different exercise and you need to complete at least 80% of good results no worries you can you just have to repeat what I'm doing during this uh this exercise and the IDE is really to make sure that you you really understand and you can do it multiple times so you don't have only one shot and then you are done for that so you need to really follow all my my steps the bonuses videos are not mandatory so you can click on one button or you can accelerate the video that not mandatory but for the rest I want to make sure that you follow all my steps to become as well an inventory management expert and then you will have access to this inter international certificate this certificate is recognized by by LinkedIn so I really recommend you to register this certificate in LinkedIn it's also very important because this is one of the most strategic skills in sulation even not only for the sulation but for company and then don't forget to share all these certificates on LinkedIn I'm very happy to share uh to share with you if you go to my profile first of all connect with me sorry and then just don't forget as well to tag me uh me and ABC Supply Chain to share all your certificates and then I can reply I can reply to you and for example marine supply share manager she she done inventory man management exper before and now she could share it with me in all the network okay so don't forget that it's very important you just have to complete all my videos all my quizzes the bonuses you don't have to but I recommend to because you will have Inver more value and at the end you too you will become an expert and I can't wait to see your progress and to see your to see your certificate on LinkedIn and I will be super happy to share it to all my networks and all the theabc SP members they are very active and they also like to to like and share with everyone so just going to the end I remind you you have one free you have only you you have one year access to complete this course you can do it in few weeks come on I know you can do it only like 12 to 15 hours and but if you complete this course you will have four more has access and I'm very excited for that I really want to push you once again I repeat this like three or four times already but because this is really important and you can really change your carer and the way you work in this Supply Chan world so do it and I see you for the next video
in this video I'm going to talk about the Excel versions because I'm using a lot of excel this is for me the best Ed educational tool and the version I'm using is the latest one so I always update my my version this is a 365 Windows version it's compatible so if you want to fully enjoy my course I recommend to have all the latest version or at least the version 2019 or 16 why because you have new functionality and new ways to to do it and I feel this is this is very accessible now if you a student you can have almost Something Free from your University and from your company yeah most of the company don't switch at least to 2016 but if you're using a 2013 I'm going to use I have a lot of bonuses regarding po query and I really recommend you to you to have at least the 2016 version because it's by default installed uh you have tutorials to install you can install it manually but I feel like it will be much it will be easier for you to do that so you can use the 200 in version but I I don't recommend it if you can afford five or $10 a month with the new version you can also only pay for maybe one month you get satisfy and satisfy and then you stop paying this I feel it's important to always learn from the latest version then you can be um you can be free you can have at least five or 10 years without going back to this I do not recommend the 2010 version because the sharts are quite different the 200 2007 is very old now and I do not recommend with Mac MacBook or open Office open Office doesn't have power cry at all the graph are very different I do not feel that open Office went to the right direction the last few years so if you have a Macbook because I do have a Macbook as well I have a PC and I have a Macbook um you can install what we call Boot comp I do not recommend to use Excel on Mac directly because you don't have power query and I feel like Microsoft made Excel too slow on Mac on purpose but I really recommend you to to uh do to or you can install bootom or Parallels I'm going to show that on so you can use what we call bootom it's free and you can install basically windows on your MacBook but you have to restart if you don't want to restart you can install what we call parallel desktop and what is that is basically you are going to install a virtual machine on your MacBook and you will be able to install uh windows and Excel so this is the solution for that I'm using parallels because it's very efficient but you need more power in you need to have a powerful laptop but for most of you you I know you already use Mic you already use windows with Microsoft Excel so you won't have any problem for that so that's it for the version then we're going we're going to learn how to create all this beautiful Excel with different tools and it's going to be very very exciting so I can't wait to see your progress and I see you for the next video
welcome to the foundation level let's go straight to the point before making the Excel we have very important episodes really understand what are the different types of inventory management policy regarding how much to order when to order and what the different level of complexity so the first one is what are the different types of inventory management you have multiple way to supply your St but at the end the principles remain the same all the companies we have suppliers and we we have customers right so it starts maybe from raw materials from China India or where maybe in the US then you're going to supply factories in Mexico and these factories in Mexico will supply maybe you have multiple level of factories and they will supply distributor in the US and the US uh distributor will supply maybe different level of Warehouse or distribution centers after supplying stores or maybe directly to Consumers for for example like e-commerce business so this is basically the different the the different level of the supply chain and for each level you don't need to have the same level of complexity for replenishment and Supply your inventory you have you have three main different difference the first one is retail and stores if you work in the retail industry I've been working for many years in the retail industry with for example the catlon with more than more than 2,000 stores in a store usually you have the what what the the customer will see where you can go shoping and sometimes not necessarily the care but sometimes you have what call reserve a storage area to replenish the the store this kind of replenishment is very very short for example you are selling Coca-Cola you have maybe 200 bottles in the store and you have one pette of 1,000 bottle and you're going to replenish for this kind of system you don't need much complexity you don't need Safety stock I would recommend that most of the most of the time I do not recommend to have any reserve I recommend to have like a very fast replenishment from your but if this is the case you don't need much complexity you know you just have to be aware how fast you have to replenish then from the stores you have different suppliers if you're part of a network for example Walmart they have a very short lead time maximum like 24 hours lead time from their DC so you don't need much complexity uh to replenish you just have basically just to keep it simple when you sell one you replenish one etc etc you could have a store that will directly buy to Long late time suppliers but in this case I'm going to take the example of the DC okay that's the first example the second example is what we call Warehouse um in the warehouse we do have the shipping we have the picking packing we have the storage and we have the reception most of the time we have we have two kind of supply chain or Inventory management policy we have the one inside the warehouse from the storage area to the peing packing area this one is very simple it's once again it's very short time you can replenish multiple times a day we can use a very simple Min minmax or coverage for that but for the Warehouse according to the the lead time of the supplyer could be few hours we could be six months if you have a six month you need more you need more parameters to cover from seasonality lead time uncertainty Etc if you have a very short uh supplyer lead time you don't need you can keep it once again very simple you sell one pallet you replenish one pette so this is the second one the third one is the factory the factory is quite similar to BNS to uh the warehouse in a from most of the time we say oh but I work in the factory it's very different from a warehouse or from retail but at the end the principle remain always the same I've been working with almost all the industries in the world most of my members like I'm working with pharmaceutical food industry raw material gas petrol Diamond medical ngu etc etc we all use the same princip in a factory you have a production area you have the finished good storage sometimes and you have the shipping and we have you have to replenish the component to the production era most of the time as a supply chain leader in a factory you have you are responsible for this part and you are responsible to make your components um available for the production so you have two kind of you have a shortterm replenishment and you have a long-term one with your supplier your suppliers around the planet okay so this is the different level of sulation and for each level you have what I was explaining the introduction you have different level of complexity the more you will include parameters when you want to replenish or other stocks the more you will increase your performance but at one point your performance will start to stabilize and you won't see any benefits or you will have to add much more complexity to improve your performance for example um I was saying before I try to implement the forecast the weather forecast uh in the replen system for example for for the long and uh it makes sense when you have more sun when it's hot you're going to sell more cap or t-shirt when it's cold you're going to you you you will probably sell much more like warm jacket or winter products it makes sense on the paper it's much more complex than you see because what is hot what is the warm definition is it um seven like I'm going to talk in degrees because Fahrenheit is is more American but yeah if it's like it's warmed 15° at 25° like in Spain 15° is very cold in when I was in Brazil I was freezing at 15° because we don't have a proper isolation in in the apartment but 15 degrees in the in Belgium is quite warm right you can do barbecue outside etc etc so the definition of the like implementing the weather in your replenishment system say okay it's going to be warm you have much more parameters that you think it's about the temperature the humidity how long do how many hours of Sun or War temperature do you consider it's warm each location could be dependent and every product has has a different sens sensitivity for some product you could sell 50% more for some products you could sell 500% more so at the end I was a good idea on paper but then it was way way too complex to to implement and at the end the performance was just terrible and just a very simple minmax method it's just to give you one example that sometimes most of the times it's good to start simple see the result and when you see that it's going to getting more and more complex and also you spend way too much time to train and your team because they don't really understand what is behind sometimes it's the time to stop or you make it fully automated and everyone has to accept that this is a black box and the black box is coming from the machine learning you have to be aware that at one point the machine learning and AI will be able to do it basically automatically it's not as easy as people think it's not as magic as people think if you don't have the right foundation if you don't have the right parameters if you don't have the right data at the end the machine learning will just crash as much as before I've been working with different startups and one of the startup wanted to implement an AI model for to forecast fashion products for you know for for the fashion industry and on the paper it was great but because of the poor quality of the data because they didn't have the they didn't centralize for example the promotion calendar even the quality of the the the codes they were using was incorrect the item codes at the end was just a disaster and we went back to a very simple model which was much more efficient and also much easier to explain to to everyone so keep it simple at one point yes I will go to machine learning and machine learning and AI but most of the company today they're not ready for that and they will have much more profits and performance by implementing Simple Rules than by implementing very complex AI or machine learning model but one day I'm going to sh you more about this I'm going to talk about it in the expert level as well okay so it's very important if I go back to this keep in keep keep in mind that the shorter is the lead time the simpler should be your your inventory management uh system okay if you have less than one day lead time with your supplier you can keep it very very simple you can use a very simple coverage I'm going to go back to this then you can use like a less than one we can you can use a very simple minmax or you can switch to a dynamic minmax if you start having more than seven days a lead time why because if you have more than one we you can say okay maybe we have some seasonality we have a PE coming we have Christmas coming so we can start adding more parameters to anticipate the future but the shorter is your lead time keep if you really want to keep it simple have very short lead time and life will be much easier for you uh and for your level of stock as well your level of stock will be much lower because you don't need to you won't have much uncertainty if you go to 180 days for example hm is ordering most of their stock even one year in ADV Advance you have much more uncertainty on your suppliers on the demand because you don't really know okay what's going to happen for with the the market for example it's very difficult nowadays to predict what's going to happen next year so you have to cover to use multiple tools to cover the to balance the risk between different model because you won't be able to have to spend too much money on too many products you will have to balance and decide okay what are the most strategic products and what the products that I can sacrifice if uh we are not sure to sell it okay so I'm going to go step by step from very simple models to Dynamic mmax to Dynamic s stock including suppliers and certainty including supplier demand and certainty including different ways to classify your products with ABC XYZ analysis etc etc we're going to start simple and go step by step but I can tell you even if you have a longly time you could even start with simple minmax or dynamic mmax if you have nothing it will be much better and starting to add something too complex at the beginning you will have these two options I'm going to explain you how to do it but I can't wait to see your your progress with me okay so different Inventory management policies if I if I go back to this if you are if you have very shortly time for example in retail you can use a very simple minmax that will be enough for the beginning if you do have like a warehouse or different level of Warehouse you have a distribution Network for example in the US or in Europe I was working with um Deaton we had 50 distribution centers I was using like Dynamic M mmax including seasonality and lead time that was way way enough for that we were just implementing few rules for shortage management when where we had not enough stock for everyone and if you if for example you're a distributor or you have a big DC you can use the dynamic mid Max or the what we're going to we're going to see with safety stock and EQ and for the storage inside your Warehouse in your for the this just to keep it very simple inside your Warehouse you can keep it very simple with a min max or a coverage coverage solution okay and for the factory it's the same principle than the warehouse you don't have much difference or you don't have much J you want to keep it simple use a mean Max method or if you have uh if you have very longly time and lot of uncertainty I recommend to switch to Safety stock plus EQ and different methods to classify your products it's the same for raw material suppliers and Factory the principle are the same okay so I hope this is clear and we're going to start slowly with the foundation then we go back to we go to professional experts level and step by step I'm going to explain to you how to face uh all the different level of inventory management policies but in this one we're going to start with very simple parameters like KP average say average Le time lot size ABC analysis and then we're going to add more parameters that will give you more performance but also a bit more complexity and risk and we will have to find the balance between performance and complexity to make sure you go step by step to the right direction okay great so I'm I'm not going to present all of this I'm going to go back to this slowly you don't if you if you think I'm going too fast it's okay I'm going to go back to the basics and the basics at the beginning one two 3 four and step by step I'm going to explain to you what uh to do
okay so when do we have to order this is a very important question sometimes we forget about this question we we used to order every month or every week but we never really challenge that with our company policy so that's a very important question when and how much to order in the one to order you have two main options you have the fixed period basically okay I'm going to order every Monday or every month the first Monday of the month or you have you have if condition when my stock is equal to X for example I will order when my stock is equal to 10 I will I will fill up and I will place order to my supplier so the one question is very connected to how much do we need to order that's why uh the for the how much to order you have two options or you always ordered a fixed quantity what we call most of the time economic order qualtity or it could be a minimum of order quantity from your supplier but for example I will always order under quantity and I will try to optimize the transport the cost of the products try to fill my container etc etc and you have the variable quantity to level Max so you could say okay I will order up to 100 quantity I will have 10 quantity I will order to 100 quantity so I will order 90 quantity and the quantity will change each time so you really need to understand this it's quite simple and um but at the end I'm going to show you multiple example sums um more complex than others you don't have to get everything right now because I'm going to get back to this slowly with multiple example after so if I go back to the first one fix period okay and variable quantity that's the first option I for example I will order every Monday to 100 quantity and in this one I will keep it simple it's instantly time means like when you order the stock let's say that your supplier is next to your store or next to your factory okay so in this case in this case for example I'm going to order every week every Monday okay so every Monday this is my stock level and this is my time every Monday my stock okay I'm going to sell sell sell sell sell boom and Monday say okay I'm ordering up to 100 so my stock for example was 20 I need to order 80 okay then I'm going to sell sell sell sell sell oh Monday again boom this time I have fly quantities in stock so I'm going to order 60 next week bum bu bum I'm going to sell sell you see the symbol and he said oh only sold five quantities so I need to order only um five to to fill to this maximum one qu sometimes it's not enough some oh this week had a huge huge sales and I need to wait like I'm out of so on sday but I need to wait Monday to other 100 quantities okay etc etc so this is this example fixed period and variable quantity it's easy to coordinate because basically you you will place your order once a week so you don't have to double check every hours if you need to order it's quite good for Global optimization for transport and suppliers because because you have only one order for your supplies it's easy to for example have a full track or a full container other but the problem with that is other quantity you have another quantity variation sometimes you will only order maybe one quantity when you could order one pet to save cost you have obviously shortage shortage risk because you have to wait next Monday let's say your top seller is out of stock on Tuesday but you have to wait on the next Monday to other another quantity and you also have over Overstock risk sometimes because you will like in this case you will order five more quantity but you have a lot of safety that you you could wait another week to order so that's that's an easy uh easy way to to start with benefits and disadvantages as well uh but this this is just with instant Le time if you have a Le time let's say oh I need to wait one day or two like this is the same example you see but this time when you order you don't get the stock immediately so you have to wait and you will keep selling and at one point you will receive the quantity and boom okay so the main difference I go slowly in this case I got the stock immediately in this case I'm going to wait for one day so you have you order but you wait for one day and then you get the stock okay it's a bit more complex to understand that's why I wanted to start with a simple one but at the end it's the same but you keep selling while you are waiting for your stock so this is the same principle and this is the more realistic um principle that you will see in most of the companies you always have to wait most of the time to get your stock except or only if you have you are very close to your supplier okay so that's the first solution fix period and variable quantity to Max the second solution is variable period and fixed quantity so we do the opposite this time you will say okay you order 80 quantities when stock equal 20 so you see we have a minimum and we can call minimum or re point I'm going to use this two and you say okay I'm selling selling selling and when my stock is equal to 20 boom I'm going to under 80 and it could be like after seven days or after one day or after 12 hours or after 1 minute okay so most of the time this this is done automatically by a 0 system otherwise you will have someone who will be who will have to check every minute okay is my stock 20 is my stock 20 and you will have to do this on multiple items with different minimum quantity of real quantity per item obviously this qu this real point should be different per item otherwise you will have way too much St for one and not enough for another one but I'm going to talk about this later so this principle is safe because you will never wait like in the first one you remember we are waiting next Monday in this one you say no I don't wait if I need the stock I do the stock it will optimize the order quantity per item not globally you say not globally because you could have one order for one item time uh one day and the and another day for another for the same suppliers so for example for your supply you could have 20 different orders in in the week and not one like the previous model you only order every Monday so it's good per item to have for example full pette or full box it's not good for Global optimization and it's it's good like for your buying price per time for example sometimes you have a discount if you buy at least for example you sell shoes or you you buy food or pharmaceutical products you have a discount if you buy at least 10 products or 20 products so you will you will optimize this by say okay I have a fixed quantity and I will optimize my price by this but you won't have Global optimization because you you could have like what I say you could have an another anytime during the day or during the week and that's the challenge with this model okay now I give you the same example that was instantly time means that one I order the stock I receive instantly in this case now I do the stock but I have a lead time of one day this is the same principle but this time I keep selling and boom I need to order again so it's a bit it's bit I think it's more real more realistic with with the current company and you have the same same challenges sometimes you would have to order too much okay so it's maybe too much information right now but what you have to keep keep in mind right now is the first solution you order every every month every Monday in the very cyclic period always at the same time in the second one you order one you reach a different me minimum level and this minimum level could be 40 and then you will order always the same quantity that's the two main options regarding when do do you have to order with with benefits and disadvantages the main challenge with the second one is like okay I will have to order every minute which which can be insane if you don't have everything automatic like this cat or you could order maybe once a year if if you have huge quantity like to order like for example you say no only order one container um at any time but I'm selling few units per per day at one point you could only have one other per year and it will be very bad for your inventory level way too high for your for your cash flow okay so that's the second one now we have a third solution the third solution is using fixed period and fixed order quantity if there is a condition we had a condition if my re Point here is minus or equal to 20 so we're going to use we're going to combine these two and in this case what we're going to do we're going to say okay if my stock is equal or less than 20 I'm going to order but only once a week okay so I'm going to order every week boom boom boom I'm going to check on Monday okay where is my stock if it's below equal than 20 I'm going to pass one 80 quantities to order if it's more like this case I'm not passing I'm not putting any orders because there is no we are more than 20 quantities that's it okay so that's another model it's easy to coordinate you have in the same way Global optimization of transport and suppliers you have fixed other quantities per item uh the problem with that is you have a lot of risk for shortage because you try to optimize the quantity you want to order per itm globally but you have big risk for uh to miss during Mis like for example this one you will be out of stock here and you can have other quantity no you don't have other quantity variation in this case I'm going to correct this so that's the third the third solution is this one you can also have a third B solution is instead of always ordering 80 quantities like this one you'll say no I'm going to order to a Max Level so I'm going to order from 20 to 100 and it could be 80 quantities 190 or even five quantities if your minimum is very close to to to the max level okay so you have three solution you have the we if I go back to this you have you order every Monday to a Max Level then you order when you reach a certain level you order to the max to the you order with the same quantity sorry now we have a third solution and the third solution we're going to combine uh the solution one and two we have the fixed period and the fixed AO quantity if my Realo point is equal or less than x so in this case for example I'm going to order every Monday only if my stock is less or equal to 20 and I will always order 80 quantities okay so in this case you see like oh when I reach 20 but only once a week so I'm going to check every Monday what is my stock level if it's less than 20 I order 0 quantities if it's more than 20 like for example in this case in this Monday I'm for example at maybe 4 quties I said no I can't order because I need to be at 20 quantities so in a it's a good way because you can coordinate easily you have a global optimization and you have also like a big quantity per item so you will get the benefits of order optimization and price optimization for that the main negative point is you will have big risk for shortage if you miss the parent in this case you're going to miss and you will have to wait another like probably you will have five days out of stock because of that so I don't really recommend this one unless you have a very very fixed period like you're going to do it every every day for example and you won't have too much time before you do that so that's my recommendation for that so you have this option of always ordering the same quantity 0 or like before you could do the same but instead of ordering always the same quantity this is a third B solution you could you could order to a Max Level uh so it could be 80 190 quantities according to what is your max level okay but these these two are very similar you just not optimize uh the quantity you want to order you will you will do it to a Max Level okay so you have one two three I know it's maybe a bit too much to start but it's what you have to keep to remind is I can have a fixed period every Monday and order the same quantity or not to a Max Level then you have the fixed period you will order as soon as sorry up you will order as soon as you need the stock this is more challenging to process if it's man ual and you can combine these two and you will have the fixed fixed PA and fixed order quantity but you have a risk to miss a specific period if this period is too long okay so my conclusion went to other I know it was probably too fast but my recommendation are very simple for most of the company I recommend fixed period 95% of the time why because it's too complex to to put orders all the time I recommend to follow the company policy for invoicing order commercials etc etc but keep in mind the shorter is the lead time the shorter should be the review period if you have land at 7 Days supplier lead time I would recommend to place order every working day if you have more than four weeks every week if you have more than three months every two weeks and if you have more than six months every months why because you only like if you have six month late time you don't have you really want to optimize your container and your transport you don't want to have like you you don't want to receive one produ every day from China if you're in the US or or very long lead time in in the opposite if you have a very very short lead time the the C of Transport is much smaller most of the case like for retail industry and you will reduce a lot the level of Stu because you will see my formulas after that one of the key parameters is the lead time the longer is the lead time the more you need safety the more you need stock to to cover against this long Le time so keep it very simple this is very simple rules that I will apply I would just add some exception for what we call for Urgent orders if you have if you have like for example like let's say you order every Monday but on Wednesday or or Thursday you say oh but I have this this super super important he had massive sales and need out of stock I should not wait by Monday and my recommendation sometimes is to do it by exception only is like for very strategic product for example this one you say okay I'm ordering every week but at one point like um on the on on on Thursday I say oh okay this this product is will be out of stock if I don't Place Another right now and I will only do it for very important products so we're going to do that in Excel I'm going to show you in this file so this is the foundation I'm going to have a specific video for that but you you will be able to see quickly what is how many ENT orders are there and if it's enough to place maybe one order for one specific suppliers we're going to do it step by step no worries stay with me but this is the ID uh to make sure that we we don't wait too long if it's a very important products ideally this is the best way you should have a different review period per supplier and per group of products this is much more complex to do so I would recommend only to do it for Urgent orders close to zero zero stock but at the end start simple track and optimize start maybe with once a week and if you feel that you always always have a g order to to place adjust theit maybe try to to have orders twice a week or the opposite if you feel that you are you are spending way too much in terms of Transport optimization so keep it very simple and in the next video we're going to talk about like slowly what are the best quantity how to optimize and go back to this different Inventory management policy
okay so now the next question how much to order I'm going to talk about the min max versus the Safety stock and EQ EQ for economic order qualtity okay that's another introduction but we're going to start with the minan max in this module but I wanted to really to introduce these two I go back to when and how much to order when to order you I I remind you that it's you have you have two options you have a fixed period every Monday or months and you you can have when stock is equal to X so when for example order one stock equal to 10 that's the two options for one to order but these two are always very very very related each other the second one is how much to order fixed quantity or variable quantity and that's what we're going to talk about right now the minmax what is the minmax the minmax is very simple I like it and basically you have a minimum this minimum could be called as well reorder point we have a lot of confusion okay what is reorder point the real point is when you have to place the order okay so you have a minimum you have a minimum When You Reach This minimum you say okay let's say for example 10 you say when I have 10 I need to order to Max so when you reach this minimum boom you're going to place this order and at the end you will still sell this is the lead time for the supplier you're going to you're going to wait and then you're going to refill to be Hest you will not really refill to the max because if you for example if you're the 80 quantity is here when you're going down you're going to refill up to this level just to be honest with you but I just want to keep it simple for for the graph so you have this very simple method and most of the time yeah you're going to you're going to refill this and you're going to calculate what is the minimum and what is maximum why do you have a minimum and maximum to optimize the the transport and the service you don't want to have the min max to close because otherwise you will have to place order all the time but you don't want to have it too um too high because you will have too much safety uh and too much socks in your distribution center or in your store for example okay so the formula I'm going to get back to this formula after we're going to use average say lead time safety lead time and seasonality in the foundation level two and the minimum we going to use a ratio with a Target service level I'm going to get back to this but just to give you an introduction for that then we do have the Safety stock and the economic order qualtity I'm going to get back to this as well in the professional level but basically what would you could do you could say okay each time I go to zero I will order 100 quantity this is like in a perfect world with no uncertainty you know exactly what's going to happen if you know exactly what's going to happen you don't need any safety but this is not the reality so what do we need basically we need to cover from this and for that we're going to add Safety stock and once you have the Safety stock you are going to order always the same quantity what we call economic order quantity this economic order quantity will help you to optimize the cost of transaction you don't want to every minutes and also the cost of um holding uh inventory you don't want to have too much inventory in your in your company okay so we're going to find this balance between these two and at the end we are going to optimize to have uh Safety stock plus what we call EQ that's the two main ways to manage uh inventory and for that we have again we have a re the point as this rear point we're going to get back to this with different formulas and lead time okay the r is more like this it looks always messy but at the end you need to cover from most of the r but sometimes the Safety stock is not enough and it's completely okay to have shortage because if you had 100% of availability all the time you will need infinite stock okay so that's the two main way what is important is to understand the benefits and the advantages of and disadvantages of every solution I'm going to start with the minmax and then we're going to get back to the Safety stock and EQ the minmax is very easy to implement simple efficient like if you have nothing or if your replenishment for example is manual today it's a very very good start you'll have a lot of profits at the beginning the disadvantage is is you you will not consider the demand uncertainty and the supply uncertainty I mean you could do it but more manually uh you will not consider the inventory and alling cost you could have Overstock with long Le time this is one of the trend I get from the mmax and you could have short text short shortage sorry if you have long review period if you if you don't order frequently so I recommend the minmax for if you have nothing for shortly time and if you have also low volumes because when you have very low sales you don't have much much data to analyze or forecast the min max will be efficient especially for shortly time on the other way the Safety stock and EQ I would feel is more accurate it has a more total cost approach it's not only about the the cost but you really consider the co the the uncertainty the cost of holding cost etc etc he will use the Dem certainty and super uncertainty it will we will use the the holding cost and inventory cost we were saying before the disadvantage is it's more complex to implement you will you will have this um this um this impact that you will kind of Overstock on low volume because you have so much uncertainty on L sometimes you have way too much I feel you have too much stock and we're going to use the normal distribution and you have limits regarding the normal distribution I'm going to get back to this after so I recommend this solution for iol if you have bigger volumes if you have longly times and if you can also combine with the forecast to to improve even better the the accuracy of this model so in the first modu we're going to talk about in the foundation we're going to talk about minmax and then we're going to move to Safety stock and EQ I really recommend you to follow the foundation level even if you say ah no no it I want to use the Safety stock because I have long Le time and uh I want something more accurate yes but be careful because most of the most of the foundation like the lead time the ABC analysis uh the seasonality all of this I'm going to see that in the foundation level so if you go straight to the the professional module you won't get everything uh straight to the point so I really recommend you to even if it's really fast check the main parameters first because and on the professional level I will go much faster and I will use only I will just talk about about the new parameters that we're going to use for this level so let's go step by step now let's go back to the Excel file finally we're going to get back to Excel and start building our first Excel to automate your replenishment
okay let's start finally in Excel no more talking no more blah blah let's let's go straight to the point and the idea is really to first of all please don't not this Excel file below or above the video it's very important that you practice with me that you use this data and then you can Implement to your company I can tell you that even this first level Foundation is much much better than most of the company in the world because it's it's very simple very efficient and I can tell you that most of the companies all they are way too complex they don't go back to the basic or they don't even have this kind of structure to give you a clear visibility or okay what are the situation and how to raise orders on with the right quantity at the right time uh so what we're going to do in this first video I'm going to just to I'm just going to introduce you what is this file what what is the structure of this file and in the next video I will have one specific episode per parameter to make sure that you get it it's also very important if you want to go to the next level professional quickly that you really follow me for specific parameters like seasonality average sales lead time because in the next one I would go much much faster and I will not go go back to this one like for example also the capis okay so what is this file this file is called foundation minmax and first of all we have the main kpi avability the part of discontinued stock or obsolete stock the stock turn is how many what is the the inventory turnover I'm going to get back to all of this kpi we can see quickly what is the the the situation per brand the ABC availability is not great especially for acod I'm going to get back to this you can see quickly as you have a quick overview okay what are my main stocks my main stock you can see that the my main stock is $400,000 and it's discontinued stock which is not good we need to clean that uh we have a top 10 sales as well which is good and you can see that the number two is out of stock we need to raise an order because we we we're going to lose $18,000 in sales and we also have a supply report we have three brands that we Supply from this specific um specific location and you can see what is the situation avability stock turn and also how much orders we need to raise as soon as possible so I'm going to also get get back to when do we have to order again I was talking about that before but you have a clear overview okay what is my situation quickly and you can really go straight to the point and you can also raise order for example let's say you have an Erp system or you can directly send to your suppliers okay this is what we need to to raise today uh otherwise we're going to lose money we're going to lose revenue and our customers won't be happy so that's the dashboard to feed this dashboard we need a base and this base is this one so what is really important and most of the company they don't really get it it's really important to consolidate all your data into one file most of the time always it's to me see you have different team with different files or it's in an Erp system but you don't really know okay how many how many items do we have how many of them are active or discontinued what is the situation of stock what is the transit what is the avability so the idea is really to have one file with everything and today it's really possible to have much more data than before even into Excel because you don't have limitation and it can be very very fast to calculate so the first thing I recommend if if you feel that your file is too slow you can go to formula I'm using the latest version of excel if you don't have the the one you can just Google it but you can always go to calculate options and you can go to manual if you go to manual and you press you won't you won't recalculate all the time you know this sometimes you have a like calculation in progress if it's too slow you just go to manual and each time you're going to press F9 or each time you're going to do you're going to save this file it will recalculate so you don't have to do it all the time especially when you build the file so if you have for example 10 20,000 items it could be a good solution uh although there is also another solution if your your file is too slow is to switch to power query so we I'm I'm going to do that I'm going to show you in the bonus um and in the in the the expert level how to use power query is going to be because you're going to you are able to use much more data and you won't slow down your your file okay so I'm going to stay in automatic mod because this file is quite light and in this file we're going to use we what we're going to do so we're going to consol consolidate this base with the product range the supply information the sales ABC classification this capis and then we're going to go back to the stock how to raise stock how to calculate the mean Max and also how to generate okay but how much do we have to order and which part of these orders are very urgent and maybe I should not wait for the next Monday to ra to raise these orders okay for that we're going to we're going to fit this file with different tabs these Tabs are very classic you have the price tab the sales tab per week we have the stock information you have the transit what is in transit between the between this specific location and the supplier you have the lead time I'm going to get back to this and the lot and we're going to create an ABC classification we're going to do some pivot table we're going to create a seasonality in the level two of foundation not in the level one and we will have I'm going to talk quickly of the normal distribution but no is I'm going to go step by step so that's that's the structure of the file it's pretty simple you don't need much data for it um it just price sales stock Transit lead time and the loot size for every product which is quite simple and I like it because you don't need much information okay
so if you want to create this file I'm going to just go from the the first step and in the next one I'm going to get back to the to the to the other ones just keep in mind as well that you can open you see you can open this so how you do that for example you don't want to see that you just go to data and just go to to click to group uh you can add if you need more space in this file okay I'm going to keep that I'm going to remove that contrl Z something also important for the visibility of the file you can freeze and um what we call that I just give you some Excel advice you see like this this part here is not moving when I scroll I'm scrolling down it's very important that you can freeze the pain so you go to view freeze pains I'm going to unfreeze first and if you do that is not very convenient when you go right or left it's kind of messy you don't really see the item Cod and what is at the top so what you're going to do you just C select this cell because I like to to see always my abc CL ification you go to view freeze Spain you just click here and now you see it's much convenient to um to to use this file so that's that was my few recommendation and the last one is when you going to build this file let's say you have this range list from a file most of the time when I do Consulting most of the time just having the clear list of what are my products what give me the full list with active nonactive like discontinued stock and a new products it's always a challenge I don't know why but it's always a challenge so usually like it's obvious yeah give me the full list is oh wa but there is this new cost coming and yeah this one is not clear oh yeah there is one missing so it's very important that you you take some times just to to be clear okay what is my list when you do that then let's say okay you create this new file and you say okay this is my I'm going to copy and paste value this is my my the foundation you need to have the full ranges when you do that it's very important in the structure of your data I don't like this format why I don't like this format because it's um it's not very convenient for example you say oh I want to do I let's say I want to have the the the stock where I want to have a formula like avability and I One Plus One whatever you will understand quickly when you do that great you have one run plus one but if you had a new code for example let's say I have a new item 4444 nothing happen nothing happen so what is important all when you create a tab like like this it's very important that you transform this tab into um into a tab so what we're going to do you just select this tab you can use the you can use the your keyboard for that you can select with shift down with your shift done with your brow and you go to insert and you click on table the table format will help you you see like where is your data from your table you say Okay boom first of all it's much easy to look you see like you have these colors you don't have to you don't have to do it manually it's much convenient to to to see and if you had a new item code here for example boom it will automatically create a new tab and it will also automatically duplicate the formula so it's much easier to look it's much easier to consolidate and even when you create new formulas let's say Okay I want create for example stock boom it will automatically create the same format and when you create a formula for example I will say avability you you know it's not F2 we will use the the name of the column so it's much also much easier to read in the formula for example avability plus two which is completely wrong but it's just to give you a stand out when you start like a for for example this kind of Base it's really important that you use the the what we call the table format and you will see that like when you don't have the table format you don't have this this T table called table design in this case we have it and I recommend to start from this from the table design and then you can just insert one more row at the top to make sure that you have you can have this specific information and these colors you could do the same here okay b b you can meas like this Ranch product and you do like this if you want if you like it but it's very important that use the table design and also I recommend you you see table one to rename this table as base for example because then if you want to do pivot table it's also much easier just to give you an example if I go to insert pivot table I'm going to use more pivot table after you can go from table and rench and you see you don't even have to select you don't even have to select the Bas you just click okay in the here and boom you you have your pivot table and I'm I'm going to do much more of this after so I hope you understand what is important the important is to have the full range list decision R you use the table format because it's much easier to consolidate and to have this format clean format with this different colors if you don't like the design you can change the design let's say to whatever like this you see it's moving automatically you can do use a dark one it's pretty cool you like it and we're going to start building this file so the first one I'm going to just do one V up I hope you know vup if you don't know vup uh you should follow my onl my online course about how to becoming an exper with Excel I'm going to repeat slowly I'm going to just do one but what is V up and then we're going to V up from the the item code please not that theod is in the text format so make sure that mo why the the Cod most of the time are in text when you extract from an ARP it's because um because sometimes the you have a zero before four bar codes and because of that it's like that most of the extraction the item Co is in text format so make sure that all your tab have the same um text format or number format you can also convert but make sure that you don't do much manipulation like this so for the price we're going to just do like this we select the colum I want the cost price so row number no colum numbers three and zero because I want the exact number I just press enter and boom I just have to do it once I don't have to duplicate the formula because I'm using the the tab format you do the same for sales price and in the next video we're going to keep continuing like filling this file but the most important you have the right format all your products and also it's very important that you have the right information regarding If the product is active discontinued or new I'm going to get back to this but I'm going to going to leave that for the next video
okay so before we keep building this file I wanted to go back to what what's the difference between finish Goods components raw materials and many people asking me oh I for me it's different because I'm not selling I'm not selling products for retail or I don't have a factory it's very different for me I should use like something different a different method and my answer is no my answer is no we use the same principle I've been working with retail e business pharmaceutical food oil and gas raw material big factor Sky industry we use I'm always using the same principle the same capier what will change is first of all sometime we don't use unit like if if you sell shoes you're going to talk okay how many unit of shoes if you sell raw material like copper or oil we're going to use volume or weight or tons that's the main difference so in new file you may switch quantities by the volume if all your companies is talking in different units and the second one is like yes it can be different in terms of volatility in terms of scale in terms of time frame as well some industry will work per week some companies will work per day some comp will work per month the behavior of the sales can be very very different as well but at the end like this is just to to show you if you produce like for example t-shirts and you need cotton you need to supply the cotton so we we can use the same structure of the file and the same mod models where we're going to just change the quantity of cotton by the volume or the tons how many tons of Cottons and we have different type of cotons or different raw materials of components that we're going to put into the the same file and we're going to generate the same what may be different is maybe the lead time the seasonality or the relability of the supplier but that's that's another parameter that we can use in the exact same way other words this is the same sometimes we can use we're not talking per quantity but could be per box per pallet uh but at the end we use the same principle and same for the retail so it's very important I go back to this because most of the time people always ask me oh but this is not the same for my industry and I say okay but what what's the main difference and that's the main difference the main difference that yeah your be the behavior of yourselves is different the units you're using are different but we use the same principle everywhere and like for a factory for example instead of speaking about finished products we're going to talk about components and new your main responsibility in the factory is to make sure that your components are available for the production so we going instead of having finished products in your file so if you go back to the file like this instead of having item C like finished goods you will have item C components and you will use the same for ABC classification XY Z avability etc etc so while you while you are building your ranges just to the the products you are buying and if you do in the same time finish goods and components I recommend to split into two separate files because uh there are most of the time this is two separate jobs to to manage that okay so that was just a quick a quick introduction for that but I feel it was very important to talk about it
another video before we we build this file uh is the data extraction this is one of the main challenge for you is okay D I don't I can't get my data I can't get my sales my stock my price so keep in mind that I'm not looking for a lot of information keep in mind that I'm only looking for Price sales stock what is in transit lead time but you can do it manually lead time I'm going to switch back to zero that's the one and the loot size so it's not I'm going to get back one by one but it's not a big deal like I'm not I'm not expecting you to have the weather forecast or the weather history for the last two or three years this is very simple I'm only looking for 52 weeks history which is not a big deal and but if you have if you have some struggle just to give you my my recommendation I always found the way what is very important you have seven steps i' I've been sharing that in my course SM metric but I really want to go back quickly to that first of all you have to be very clear what do you need what is the the data you need and you need to write down and you need to create a first draft so what's that's the goal of this Excel file you're going to build a first draft with the key data and also if you need to have specific ipis I always recommend to calculate this into Excel then you can use it as a specification if you want to update your Erp so really Define what you what do you want clearly is not only oh I want sales okay you want sales how how do you want sales per item per day day per week per month you have to be very clear with that the second one is to identify the key person in the company and I always found someone and the the the profile of this person is most of the time like in it in the IT department this person has a lot of experience a lot of information in his head and most of the time this person is fully recognized and it's a very stressful position for this person has a lot of solicitation from everyone it's always urgent and I feel that it's a bit it's a lack of respect and this person is most of the time overwhelmed and um and my recommendation from that is first of all to identify this person and build a long-term trust relationship don't make this person like I feel they not most of the time recognized and they they're used by people so I will always recommend you to first of all identify this person and make sure this person get a reward of your projects and at least your respect and your and your time it's not only oh I need you it's it's you have to give it me right now so I I'm very cautious with that it's not politics it's just being aware and respectful for this job because this job most of the time is not very uh is not very cool um so you need to identify the data source that's the third step and this person can help you for that you have many many data source different data source database Erp like sap I've been working with ASP orle Manan Neto all the CRP they're basically all the same they use the same the data structure now you have the cloud which is much easier now because you it's I feel it's more accessible more complex but more accessible you can have uh you can also extract data from the bi directly which is not the best but you can do that and you I was using for example sa analysis for many years which which was very convenient because I could put it directly into Excel or you can get Excel file for example for your sales or you can ask it to automatically extract for example your sales stock into a CSV or text file and then you can connect with your file or directly from a database so you have different um data source point the next type is to when you found okay I found my data source you need to do first manual extraction by manual extraction you need to find a way and for example in sap I was using what we call um I was using um sq01 we were creating query to extract different data I didn't have all the access at the beginning so I was asking to my colleague then uh they gave me the access because I I was the guy responsible for the projects but make sure like you have one maybe not the the most recent one but at least to try what you what you want to build whatever whatever is the for the text format I'm not going to give you a full course of a to extract per IP but for sure you have someone in your company for that the the fifth step is to standardize and automate so once you you've done once and you know okay this is exactly what I need you may want to meas different table for example oh I want the cost price and the Sal Price is two extraction but you want to have it into one and I recommend to for that or you do it into Excel or you do it with powerquery have a specific bonus for that after or you have for someone in into your company for I was talking about sq01 before uh to to make sure that it's automatic or it's almost automatic you just have to click to one button to have it but the first step is to make sure like your your need is clear your source is clear everything is clear because you don't want to ask too many times to the same person because most of the time this person have way too many projects uh to brand at the end you need to formalize the process with the the mapping and you need to train at you need to train several people especially if you're a manager to make sure who is responsible and you have a backup plan if this person leave the company or is sick or on holid dayss and you also have to make the process accessible and most of the time everyone is said y I've been working with this guy and no one knows and this person go on holidays and say and for three weeks no one can run or extract the reporting so it's very important the formalization is always the boring part but this is one of the most important and I feel that everyone is tends to recreate the same process and at the end we have so many report and extraction that have exactly the same purpose and don't forget the last step last step and this is the most important one don't forget to reward the key person really really help you to extract the data for example if your project is to implement this this kind of file to automate the replenishment and the of your company you will probably have great results reduce the inventory and improve the service invite this person to the steering committee thank him for her in public by email also by email when you share this F hey guys just just I also want to thank this person because she was very helpful for me in the meeting I always do also I like to do restaurant and I also bring a C and my chocolate cant uh because I feel that's something I like and I like to share and also send private email to the manager of the person help me before uh the annual review to make sure that she can have a salary increase or promotion if I feel that she was very good with me uh so once again it's a long-term relationship and it's not about having something very fast and use this person it's about a longterm relationship and for me it's always a win-win and if my project win this person will win and we will keep working together and will be a long relationship and that was my case for example at deat C after so that was for my introduction how to get data there is always a way do it in the do it in the proper way step by step and I'm sure you will find a solution as well to get your data and when once you have your data you can go back to the file the structure of the data is quite simple it's always a table I always recommend to have the table structure like one row one information when you have sales always have the period like this not on the on the colum format you could have if I give this is the previous version of my file you could exct directly like this with the period like like this on the horizontal format but it's not very convenient because if you have more more like more more weeks sales for example your your file is going to is going to crash so you always need to extract the exact same period which is not very convenient so I always recommend to have the vertical format one period one information you can have 200,000 rows whatever because now there is no limitation in Excel but always use the the vertical format if you can and I'm going to explain to you in the next videos or to use it and how to do a pivot table to have the information
in this video we're going to integrate in Exel information we're going to start with sales and I just wanted to go back quickly to what is important when you integrate data into your file the data structure is very important one file only if possible I was explaining that before do not edit the imported data it's important that you don't really touch it because otherwise you will have to do it every week or every day you want to update your file One Source one sheet one pivot table one cheet because then you don't you don't have too many sometimes I don't respect this rule but because I don't want to have too many uh spreadsheet but it's important to make it very clear very clear name for the sheet the pivot table the name the columns the rows and once you want to mesch table uh you can use vup or you can use uh it's important that you have one table with everything then you can use the segment so just to give you some example you see that my file is very clear you have the price the sales the stock you I'm not I'm not using different names like I'm also using different colors you can change the colors if you select and I you press shift you can change the tab colors to whatever you like which is good I can you can press control to and select if it's working okay sorry sometimes I'm not perfect you see like we we are all humans with Excel so basically um what I was doing like so the structure is very important you see in my base I'm using also different Cod colors for different informations the the name of my colors is Al also very clear I'm using always I I really try to make it as standard as possible then it's easier for me to use but it's also easier for someone else to use it and to um to take the leadership if I need to give this file to to someone else uh the dashboard is another color and what I was saying before it's always good like to have clear names and uh do not edit what you're going to import from your Erp system if you want to have information it's also better to use Excel table I explained this in my previous video then you can use pivot table and the best way also to integrate information if you want also to clean automatically is to use power query I'm going to do that in a bonus module it's not mandatory to get satisi certified Inventory management expert but I feel this is something important okay so that was just an introduction now we're going to use the sales information so you can see that this information is already in the file it could come from a specific file let's say like if it's coming from a it's coming from a specific file like this coming from your e or software or accounting system and you say okay great this is my information it's always better to transform into table formats you can convert into table format I don't have eers where is my e yeah you can select all okay like this I'm going to copy and past this I'm copy and paste value then I insert table so what do we need with sales we want to have we want to connect this file to have the last week last four weeks so quantities last 8 weeks 13 weeks 26 weeks 52 weeks it's a very good way to see okay how is behaving the how is behaving the the product in terms of sales and uh I I feel it's very useful and we can also use it for ABC analysis and also to calculate the average sales for the minan max so it's important to have multiple options we can we can also adapt adapt and simulate to see what is the best way for my minmax uh model we can also convert into a cost price sales for the inventory turnover and we're going to do that later so what how do we do that we need to have the sales so we do have the sales here you can copy and paste from your file or you can use SP query or micro to copy and paste automatically and what I want to do you can see there is a tab called Sal sales pivot in sales pivot what I'm doing I'm doing a sales pivot because it's not it's not that easy to get okay I want to have the last four week sales I could do it with visual bu but it will be way too complex so I will do a very a very simple way and the simple way is to convert this tab this tab here into pivot table here in a horizontal way but you will see that the latest week is on the left so we're going to do that again it's not that complex we going go back to this I recommend you to pause this video copy and paste the sales data into another file and practice with me okay just pause copy and paste this information here and let's do it now so how to do it we going to go to insert pivot table table runch okay great good job no we have a pivot table and it's quite simple I want to have my item card I want to have my period at the top and I want to have my S quantity Boom the only thing I want I want to have my latest week on the left not on the right so what what I'm going to do is just um I'm going to do Z Z2 a yes there is a blank I don't know why there is a blank this time it's it's interesting um yeah because when I copy and paste I copy a lot of PL so I'm going to delete this it's good to have a issues as well and then you can refresh boom and now you don't have it so you see you have this the last week is on the left of course my data is not coming from um is not coming from today but it was just to give you an example my but this is real data from real companies great and now what I want to do okay I want to all my last four week and I'm going to do average oh no it's a sum of this boom if you want the last eight weeks we just do some you can see there is a number 98 C boom and voila and you do the same for all of them why this format is good is when you're going to upload a new file with for example 2042 43 you will automatically have the last four weeks or eight weeks on the left and whatever you have 52 weeks or you have two or three years you will always have the last four weeks like eight weeks on the left if you do it on the other way it won't work so it's going to be messy and you won't have the right information so that's exactly what I've done in this file whatever you have 52 weeks two years you won't youon you won't break the file and the file will be automatically so I have the four weeks 8 weeks 13 weeks 26 and 52 weeks and that's what we're going to use in this file so it's very powerful because you can use it automatically the best way will be not even to have this tab into the file that's what we're going to use in the the expert level with power query but cuz it's quite heavy and you don't necessarily need to have this information it could be directly from the source file in the in the share folder for example but in this one I'm going to keep it very simple so you just have to do the sales pivot like this whatever you're working per week per month I always recommend I recommend to work per week because I feel it's more accurate especially when we're going to talk about seasonality but if you have very very slow set you could work per month if all your companies working per month okay and per day per day will be a I I feel it's very only for very very super super high speeed industry but you could also do it per day if you feel that this you have a very fast-paced industry great so you have this information I just create a link on the left because I want to do a vup and I can't do a vup on this way like if I want to have item one what is the 50 last two we quantity I can do a video C this way so I just create an equal here to be able to do a vup and then when I go back to my base let's just do for example this one the last four weeks I'm going to do it again equal V lookup from my itm code in text format I go back to my sales pivot I'm going to take this one I want to have this is colum number two and zero and I close and boom I have it just one thing because I'm very lazy you remember I'm a lazy person what I'm going to do is you can lock uh your you can lock your formula for like this and then you see there's a two at the top and I just switch to two by this and then I just so the doar is to make sure when you're going to duplicate is not going this two is not going to move like this so I want to lock the row number one and I press enter and then I can just duplicate this formula technically I can and you see like I don't even have to to to press three or four because I I put the number of the the colum on the top so you don't have to do it but I like to do it because um um I don't like to repeat and it's much easier and if you change the structure of the file you just change okay now there is one more colum it will automatically change your results okay so that's it now we have the sales for the last week we has for the four weeks eight weeks so that's something we're going to use later it's very important to have it and also what I've done so you also have what we have the the so you can see we have C do and S do s do is for sales price ciz for cost price sales price is useful to see okay what was the sales of the company so you could have this information directly from the file in this one I just have the quantity it's always good to have the real sales um the sales value because if you do promotion if you have different price per week it's better to have the sales value directly into your file but in this one I don't have it so I'm using a price Tab and is price side I have the cost of the product and I have the sales of the product the cost of the product is what we going to use like what is the value of the stock so it could be the latest purchase price if you don't have something complicated in your software or it could be the average cost price based on how many products that you buy uh this is a more complex um this is a more complex question if you buy 100 products at $10 and 50 products at $9 you should average the value of these products if you want to have the real value of your inventory you can do that automatically with with a software if you don't have it it's okay it's not a big deal um it's just we will will be just more accurate for the the cash flow you're using in your company right now okay so we do have the cost price and the sales price from this tab and if you want to add the the value of the sales you just multiply four weeks quantity time Sal Price and you have it for the sales value for the cost value we're going to use it later we're going to use it for inventory turnover because in important it's important to divide the inventory in cost price by sales in cost price and not sales price I'm going to get back to this just after but I just recommend you to create this kind of structure with quantity sales and value and we going also using it for the ABC analysis so that was a long video but just to give you an overview how to make this file as fast and automatic as possible and then when you just copy and paste for example the sales you just copy and paste so you use for query after you just refresh your say pivot like this boom and you already have your dashboards and your base up to date uh to calculate and generate your your quantity automatically so I see you for another video for the for the stock and Transit
okay great so now we have the we have the sales who wants to have the stock the stock is very important if you want to optimize your inventory you need to have this critical information and for that you need an extraction with your information your item code and what is important is the so quantity and if you can the stock in value if you don't have the stock in value you can just multiply by the price cost price times the quantity that will give you the price in value but if you have ANP I was explaining before uh so system will automatically do an average of every cost price with the quantity left in the in the W or the factory to have the real PR the real cost of your inventory but let's keep it simple let's have only so it would be better to have the the inventory for the last 52 weeks of your it time cost we're going to do that in the expert level but I know that most of the companies they don't have this information per item for the last few years so let's keep it simple we only only need the stock today what is your stock information today and we're going to link it into this file with vup what is very important is you need to have what we call the available stock not the physical why it's important or you need to have these two separately why it's important for example let's say you have 100 products in your Warehouse or in your factory but in this this 100 products 90 of them already confirm or booked for one specific customer but the shipping is in progress so it's very important when you're going to run the Min minmax after that you know that you only have 10 products available not 90 because if you don't consider the 100 you will tend to underestimate what you really need because these products are already they're leaving the warehouse within few hours or maybe few days so it's very important to separate these two like if you some some companies in the system you can see physical stock and available stock and other companies like most of the time they just do not consider the what is available in in the extraction so make sure you have this right information otherwise you will tend to completely like under underestimate what you need to order and you you may face a shortage because of that very important also you need to have an accurate an accurate uh stock it's the the accuracy of your stock is critical for the the quality of your replenishment and um inventory I'm going to get back to this there is um a Capi call um inventory accuracy I'm going to explain to you how to calculate and how to improve that but make sure you have at least one or two inventory Tech per year uh to to make sure you you can replenish correctly then we need to have so I just did a vup very simple then we have what we call the stock I'm going to zoom out zoom in we have the stock value if you have the information you can just multiply by the cost price then I just multiply this is just one formula to say if my statue is this discontinued so we have active stock and we have discontinued that not part of the current catalog then I'm going to take only this information we're going to use this for capis after so basically I will only consider in this colum only my discontinued stock that's it I just equal to this if my stock is discontinued you don't have to I'm going to get back to this after and something also very important you need to have the transit what is in transit with your supplier okay it's very important because if you don't consider the transit in your calculation when you're going to calculate how much stock do you need uh if you have 1,000 quantity coming from your supplier and you don't put it in your the formula you may always order every day the same quantity because you don't see what is coming so you need to add the stock in quantity in value I'm going to use this later you can you can add this and the transit stock to make sure that we can then implement this into the formula so so for the transit I keep it very simple and you just have if you go to Transit is just item code ATM and the order quantity and the order I don't even have when the stock is coming because in this case we have very short lead time the lead times are only one one two or three or maximum five days so I just want to keep it simple in the in the next file professional and nexted we will have specific day because it's important when you have two three four five monthly time to know when the stock is coming okay so just quantity order and and uh then we're going to just do a v cup to have the the the transit quantity it's just a v cup with the item con and the transit time just upload this if you have shortly time you don't need to have much information you just need to know to make sure you're going to take this quantity into account for the min max and Order calculation
okay great so now we're going to talk about kpis uh in this specific module we're going to talk okay how to implement kpis then to analyze them and then to go to the next step for optimization we have the right foundation now we can move forward so the first one the most simple one of the most important one is to track the service we do have avability rate or we do have fear rate uh we're going to talk about availability rate first I've been talking about avability in my previous model so I don't want to waste your time I know your time is precious so the formula is exactly the same it's very important we do it on the warehouse stock we do have one warehouse and multiple sit after I'm going to remove this filter data clears so it's very important we use the same formula only for active code only if stock is super more than zero than one otherwise zero and if you don't have stock you go to zero and that's it for non-active products we do have just a block or something that is not zero and we have this value and we can also pivot table this value to have like if you go to the pivot base at the top we do have the same principle we do the average of the all the availability for the the current week and we we have we have this perun per ABC classification I've done that before so I don't want to repeat something very important if you have multiple sites so let's go back to the stock level it's very important that you don't do it like this is a warehouse stock so we have 16,000 so the diability is 100% but be careful with this one if you have like 39 sides okay your avability is not 100% if you have 4 if your total is 419 right you have to be careful because some of them have zero so if you want to to um if you want to calculate the avability of this one you you will have to count how many times do you have zero okay in these specific times we have only one zero so the avability will be one divided by will be equal 1 / 39 so that's yeah and will be minus one one minus this so it will be 97 97% of availability for the first one so you could add a formula if you if you feel like doing it oops you could have a formula to say if my uh stock this more than zero then one other zero oh sorry so you will have to do it for every single uh plan every SLE site then I have the average of all of them if you want to calculate that okay so I'm not doing I'm not going to do that but you could have a tab if you have multiple sites to calculate okay how many of them are are zero and you will have to average all of them to have the full uh the full calculation of this okay so that that could be that you could also have in this specific in this specific base you could have another colon for for example if you have two sites you could have one colum name sites and you could have site one and site two and then you could calculate directly into this file if you have maybe two or three location for your components or raw material or finished goods products so that's is for the avability uh for this one then we want to have in the dashboard we want to have also this one this one is from the site and we have a specific what do we have we have this so this is the information from your all the the sites we're using the because we have one DC and then we we are delivering to 39 different sites it could be stares factories whatever and we just have the the results we don't have we don't have it per set because there was a lot of data and for that what we're going to do is in the expert Pro avability so we have we we directly use power Cy to extract and to do a pivot table from that so I'm going to do it again directly from this tab just to show you you just go to inser pivot table okay and we want to do here week and the avability is the average Okay cool so we have this and then we can insert pure chart boom that's it so we have this with cool uh cool graph that we can use and uh it's good to see the Evolution for your Target it's good to track the availability of your main DC and it's also see to what is the availability of your customers if you have the information that could be from your DC directly what I like in this graph is is not only about what is the value today but what is the progression versus this year and last year so I've done that for this one this is the same principle I've just done from po query so you just insert pivot table from external data source and in this one I took the the query availability and then in this I could create a pivot table from this in the same way and then I just copy and paste in the dashboard the avability here and and I done the donuts for avability this is from the curent wig and this is from the base so if you go to Pivot P base you will you will get the information for this donut I've done that in my previous module so that's it for the avability we're going to talk about now Fe rate
so we have the the service capier that was the most important one the second important most important one is what we call the inventory turnover to track okay not only the value but how efficient is your inventory so I've done a YouTube video that you can watch I'm going to put the link below but I'm going to give you the the the most important today and we're going to implement it with the full base with all the items all right so what is important before is that you want to have as little inventory as possible with a good service for your customer because the less you have inventory the more you have cash to invest the more you can invest for example in new products marketing recruiting talented people in supply chain the more you will have sales the more you will have profit and you want to have this Snowball Effect in the right way it could be the opposite you have too much stock not enough cash you have to stop all your investment you have less sales less profit and you can even go to bankruptcy and many companies the next few years will go to bankruptcy because they're not efficient in a good way and the macroeconomy is not doesn't look amazing all right so we can fix that now is we have we have stuck and we need to track this kpi all along the supply chain and what is the formula the formula of this kpi is called inventory turnover or we can also call it stock turn stock turnover I'm going to use stock turn in my in my Excel file because it's just shorter you don't I don't have much space in the sale and the formula is average inventory value divided by sales or consumption so if you Factory don't sell products you're going to use consumption to your factory for example for raw material multiply by the the periods of your sales and consumption okay so for example at the global level I recommend to use 52 weeks in from a a f like an accounting point of view to say okay in the last 52 weeks what is the average performance of all my inventory but for that you also need to have the average value of your inventory per week for the last 50 two weeks if you don't have this uh that's what we're going to use in this current file we just have the the inventory today you can start with this and use a shorter period of time I'm going to give you a lot a lot of example just after all right um per item that's why when you go per item I recommend to have like a shorter period of time because what is important per item we're going to see that in the Excel is you want to know what is okay I have one quantity how much how many days do I have do I have left and you don't really need to know okay last year at the 2,000 quantities now have 100 what you need to know is like do we have one week left of stock or do you have one year left of stock that that's what we're going to going to implement right now okay what is also important is because what I was talking per item it's important that you don't have the same inventory turnover all along the year if you sell a lot of products let's say you have Christmas coming you will have to for example have a lot of inventory before and then you will have the peak of sales or maybe Black Friday this number is not consistent during the time so at the global level it's good to have a long period of time to say okay what is my average um use of my cash flow of my money during one year because this is what I'm going to pay to the bank and per item it's interesting to see what is the evolution but it's normal to have a variation if you have a low months of sales or consumption you your inventory turnover will be higher than if you have a very intense amount so it's good to track this cap the more you will see it the more you will get used to it and in the professional and especially in the expert level we will have more much more details and much more data to play with okay but I'm going to keep it very simple so yeah that was the so between inventory and sales you see that the value is different you have different cycle between 50 to 100 days okay so if I go back to the inventory turnover formula first of all you need to calculate the average inventory value and it could be an average per week or per month and it's important to use the cost the what we call the cost price of the cost of goods of good sold it's really important that uh what is um what is important is if if possible to have the average cost of every single and you do the average of all the items you buy if it is this is not possible just keep it simple what that what was explaining before use the current cost price or purchase price that will be enough just talk to your finance department and they will help you then for the sales and consumption you need to use the total sales of consumption but be very careful the the valuation has to be with cost cost price or C the main mistake I've seen so many times during my career even i' I've done this mistake many times you're going to divide your stock in cost price or cogs by your s your sales in a sales price which doesn't make any sense because you don't want to include like the margin or the profit you need should divide Apple by Apple not Apple by banana okay it's very important so be careful with that that's why we're using the cost price in the Excel file and then for the um for the period you just multiply by the number of day all right there is another formula called inventory turn cycle formula and this is almost the same the same formula but this time we want it's not in number of days but it's how many cycle per year is rotating my inventory and in this case we just going to divide sales or consumption by average inventory value we just switch the formula but at the end it's the same principle so to give you a few example regarding Apple and Samsung to for the calculation you do have apple with five billions of stock C cogs and you have Samsung with 29 billions Apple has has a very very low stock then what is important is to say okay what are the sales not in the sales price but in CS as well and app is around was around just to give you an example 200 billions but the total revenue was 274 billions when Samsung is 144 and the revenue like in sales price is 276 so you see that Apple has less stock and less sales which is a good sign now what is the yeah just be careful regarding the the valuation in C not in sales price now the sot so for Apple you just divide five by 20 multiply by the number of day not 365 days we do have 9 days which is amazing amazing it's amazing to have such a big company with so so little stock I'm going to get back to Apple in the expert level why they are so good but they don't have much products they don't have much storage so that's a very fast-paced Lo um Logistics and subl chain on the other way Samsung of course they don't sell the same products because they also do a lot of components television and stuff but the their value is like 29 divided by 104 time 365 which is 73 days which is more classic for this industry okay so that's one example if you want to have how many cycle we just switch the formula we divide 200 by five we have 40 cycles that mean that the the inventory will turn 40 times within one year for apple and for Samsung it will be only 4.9 times okay so now you have the introduction of inventory turnover we're going to get back to excel to calculate how what is the stock turn per item and then what is the stock turn for the um for the for the dashboard to have an idea okay what is the performance of this industry and to do that it's very simple again we do have the stock turns for the stock turn per item you don't you don't need to use the value because the the you can use the quantity because the quantity is constant so you could you could divide the stock this stock um in value by the the sales in value multiply by the the period but because it's you don't have multiple item you could do it in quantity for this time it's you will have the same results I can show you the after if you want okay so now let's calculate the formula into Excel we have the stock turn per item and we have the stock turn globally at this time so you can see I'm using quantity when I said no you have to use value why because per item it doesn't change anything item by item is correct but if you do you count with the average like this or just sum the number of quantity in stock by the average sales in qu if you have different cost per item you will be completely wrong so never do that but let's do it in value let's WR value like I did in the formula so let's open this and what is the formula say say okay we need to divide the stock in value divided by the average sales in case because in this case we only have the stock of today we don't have the average stocks for the last 52 weeks it's better to use a shorter period how long should be the period in the past it's it really depends on the volatility of your sales I recommend you to try and to see if it's relevant the more you will have seasonality and we're going to use seasonality and observe seasonality later the more you should use a shorter perod and the more you have volume the more the shorter period should be but in this case let use 13 weeks 13 weeks like three months of sales so we we can't we can use this one you can see we have 30 week sales cost price it's just the quantity multiply by the cost price and then we just have to multiply 13 * 7 is the number of days of the period okay it's very important to use in days otherwise because you want to have the results in days right so now we have this results if you do this per item in stocking quantity and in in in quantity for sales as well you will have the same result okay it will be the same per item so now it's great because we do have well we can see we have the this information per item zero because you don't have any stock and for example uh this one we have 241 days which is a lot and it's a discontinued product okay you can start you can play and if you want to maybe move to four week cells you can change this but don't forget also to change this you will see that the result oops four weeks what four week I I didn't use it okay so let's do setting I don't have the colon too bad let's do for example 26 you can add the colon if you want boom you will see that the result can be a different because we're using a longer period so it's good if you have very low sales on you you don't have much data all right but let's keep I like this one 13 weeks and then you see we have this um this alert this alert you say like if you are less than seven days you are red if you are more than 100 you are orange like if you're less than seven you are close to shortage if you're more than 100 you have you have way too much talk you can of course change this allet if you want it's completely Dynamic and it's pretty cool and to do that you just select uh this you can select the full branch just manage BS and you just have to say for this one you can add a new one if you want if it's greater than and then you put the formula greater than um 100 then you change the format you f orang you apply you press okay I won't do it because I've done it before that's the one and you can do the same and you can edit the rules for that okay there is something also you need to change if you don't have any data you can add an if error if error then if ER is because you are dividing by no cell so you can add 9999 that means that you have um you have a lot of stock and whatever it's 1,000 10,000 you will have the same it will be the same okay so now we have it per item it's very convenient we have this red alert and it's very useful to see okay what is for example my top stock largest to smallest and you can see that most of your most of your stocks they have very really bad stock turn uh starting with the first ones discontinued this one 500 Days this one 4,000 days and this one is pretty good this one is a card we're going to go back to ABC classification after and 30 38 days all right so that was the first one I'm going to give you in the next modules how to use a different way to calculate with seasonality and average sales but we're going to do that later uh but don't if you see these two in your Excel it's normal okay now we're going to do it per in the global level so in the global level let's go back to Pivot you remember we've done this pivot we're going to just copy and paste this pivot here and this time we want to have the stock in value where is the stock in value boom and we want to use so because we don't have the average sales per week for the last 52 weeks we're going to use the same period we're going to use 13 weeks great so what we want to do now we want to divide this two in USD USD we want to divide this two we want to divide stock by S multiply by 13 * 7 all right to have the three month period but you can do that automatically you don't have to to do it in the on the side because let's say you have another one coming it's not very convenient so what we're going to use is calculate so you click on this pivot table pivot table analysis field an items here calculate it fi and then you're going to create a new one but we already have two because let's call it stock turn two and what we're going to do we're going to divide the stock divide it by the sales in cost price 13 multiply by 3 * 7 why because 15 weeks times 7 days we're going to add this and now we have the stock turn we don't even have to do that that's exactly what I've done so we're going to remove this and we do have the stock T which is very convenient because you can then if you want to see per family it will automatically give you the stock T per family which is amazing but at the end we have the total result of 80 days all right so that's why I love pivot table because they are so flexible and then you can use it for the brush and we can use it for if you just want to have the total you just remove the brand here you have 80 80 Days of to turn and that's the the number you want to improve um with the inventory optimization and then we're going to put this into the dashboard so it's good to have the global a the global average okay we have around 80 Days of inventory based on the last three month sales you could also combine forecast and seasonality we're going to do that later but it give you an overview okay the base on the last three three months sales this is my the rotation of my inventory and it's not what is important is really to find the balance between inventory and avability in this case we're going to see that later that the focus would be really into improving the U the top salers availability without increasing the inventory value okay so that's it for inventory turnover now we have avability and stock turn in the in this tab and in the next video we're going to talk about the discontinued stock
so we have service we have inventory inter now we need another very important one for inventory management is what we call the slop slow and obsolete stock the first one slow we already done that slow means like we have your your produ is very slow to in terms of cycle and obsolute means it's discontinued stock so it's not one Ki but it's two kpi let's go back to the Excel file basically slow means you have this file slow is I inventory turnover stock turn so let's go for example go up to 200 this is all your slow item okay so if you want you can you can use a formula to condem but for me it's more about like a top done analysis I will go from the top what on my main stock above for example 200 and then I will have an action plan I will give a lot of example in the professional and expert level right but just to give you an idea what is slow obsolete means discontinued so you need to have this information accurate in your file this is a very very important information and it's very important that you have a you have a process in your company to automatically update this it could be at the end of the season manually or it could be like start date and end date in for every specific it and when the date of today is after the end dat then automatically the the item will switch into a discontinued and then you will we will be able to have a clear visibility of what is the value of that so what is what is important is what is the percentage of this continued stock versus the total so what is the total of thison stock basically is just this value so this value is 1.9 million of USD right I'm going to switch that to USD as well great and what I want to know is okay we have 1.9 million what is the total and total is 16 million so we want to have the percentage of this divided by this all right I add this colum and this colon will just show me the value only if the product is discontin because we're going to use it for the reports as well it's very simple it's just if discontinued then use the stock value all right so we have this information but I want to have the the percentage in a more efficient way and this is um this is not for me the the most efficient way so what we're going to do we're going to use a pivot table again let's go back to Pivot I never know if it's p or pivot I think it's pivot all right so let's go back to a discontinued stock we're going to copy this one always use your previous pivot table and what we want to see now is p stock stock stock we want to stock in value and this is what we we don't want per Bron we want thison stock status TR so now we do have discontinued new we have zero stock okay I want to have the percentage of this how to do that or you do it manually on the side you do like this divided by this which is not great because if you have more information coming or if the table move that will crash so don't do that what I recommend to do and that's very very simple you should you switch from you can add another one and then we can compare St add another one boom and I click on the right F settings I go to show value as percentage of ground total boom and now you have 11. 31% which is amazing you don't have to do anything if you want to see per per Brun one again once again boom you have it automatically amazing now cool so I can remove this one what is important for me is this percentage 11% 89% of active and that's the this number that we going to you're going to track and you say okay my focus is by the next two weeks I want to be less than 11% of this continued stock okay so that's it for the this ipia it's very simple to track you need to have the right information what we're going to do now is we want to do it per Brown in an automatic way we want to have this this table like this so I'm going to go back to this I'm going to copy and paste I'm going to so I do have avability let's have the 52 weeks of sales why not the stock in value you can also look for this information here if you don't find it perfector and then you see I this this um discontinu stock here and I like to see see what is only the percentage for this continued stock I don't want to have like in this tab here what is the percentage for active discontin I just want to have for discontin stock okay so for that I'm going to do this it's not mandatory for the the course but I feel it's important you to see different way to do it stay with me it's okay I want to adjust the percentage of discontin stock so for that I need to create a calculated field if I just do like this I will just have the value right I would just have the value but this is the total value and I want to compare the total value versus each brand not the total of this discontinued stock okay so for that I need to create another calculated field so I will go back to pivot table calculated field I will connect percentage of disk two for example and I'm going to divide the discontinued stock in value yeah this one it's in value by this boom and now I should have the percentage 77 16% which is very convenient because you want to see how how efficient is each brand and you can see that brand number three has a big problem with more than 16% of discontin stock which is important is like when you have a global Target you say okay we want to have less than 10% sometimes good to go deep into details you say Okay per brand this is the priority is Brand number number three and if you want to go per family you will see that few brands that for example 32% 21% etc etc so the power of the pivot table is you can really go micro level then micro level and for the analysis it's much more efficient and then you go back to the top list and I will always recommend to analyze like this you get I want to see all my discontin stock and I will filter down largest to smallest and this is basically your priority and one of the item represent the majority like is like one quarter of your discontinued stock the number one priority will be to to clean this one and make sure maybe you can do promotion etc etc I'm going to give much more example after in the expert level but now you have a clear visibility of what what is the most important to improve uh this um this continued percentage of inventory that's it I see you for another video
so we have the main three important kpi service we have inventory turnover and we have obsolete stock now we need also an ABC classification the ABC classification I've been talking a lot about the last five years my the name of my company is called ABC suppl why ABC supp because I really want to focus on the 2080 what is really important to make the difference and you know that 20% of your actions will give 80% the result is the same for products 80% % of your sorry 20% of your item will give 80% of the sales and also 20% of your item will have 80% of your inventory but that's a mindset that you should always have whatever you are starting or whatever you have 25 or 30 years experience in uh in the operations and that's for me also the the goal of this course is to really keep it simple with example that in L than 20 hours you have this expertise to implement this immediately in your company so we're going to do an ABC analysis and in the next module we're going to do XY Z analysis and if you really want to have more details I have in the YouTube video U with the all the principles but I feel you already know it and what is important is like 5% of your atts represent 40% of your volumes 20% 80 and so it's a plus b and c 80% of your attemps represent 20% of the volumes okay so we're going to do it in Excel I've done it multiple times if you have one of my other course for ABC I always do an ABC analysis so I'm going to go fast and you can accelerate this video if you know how to do it and you can slow down if you feel that I'm going too fast so what is important for that we need to use a period of time to say okay what is the most relevant period of time for the ABC analysis in this example I'm going to use the last six month sales but you could also combine forecast with sales or you could use like shorter period or longer period according to the volume of of sales the decision is really like regarding if you have very very low s take maybe 52 weeks or 6 months if you have strong seasonality I recommend to use a shorter period And if you have the forecast combine sales and forecast to make sure you also consider the new products coming because the idea is really to identify what are the most important products to focus and make sure they have the right stock and uh the right availability and this is the one you need to check every like especially Aon and because this is the one your team should check every uh single week if there is any issues because this is where all the revenue and the mistakes have to have much more impact on your business all right so how to do that we're going to do it quickly you you start from the base you can remove the filters you won't change anything we're going to insert a pivot table new worksheet yes next to ABC we're going to see the item code the item name I want to see see the sales in values I always recommend value you can use cost price if you have a factory or sales price if you have like a business you are selling something then I'm going to change the format of this I've done this so many times but the good way with a private table is then it's effic you don't want total of table of form great then you go you create the ranking ranking one one plus one I like to think sometimes when I do excel because I feel lonely in front of my spreadsheet just kidding thank you for supporting me you you always add more just in case you have more prods coming in your database so at least 30% more all right so cool you have this good job that's a great start I'm going to just copy and paste from this so total it's the I want to have the total so my total is 52 Millions for the last 26 weeks number of item 828 it just count if more than zero because you don't want to if you have less than zero it should be more and equal than zero actually actually yeah more than equal than zero you can just copy and paste this formula and then we want to have this percentage of item it's not article percentage of dollar great so we're going to do this by this and before that I forgot to say you need to sort by values so we're going to go this way Sol options descending by sales so no you have the top seller first the number one seller for the last 26 weeks is item number 10 congratulation you are the number one so you are probably the mo you are the most important to watch every single day 1.7 so in terms of item you just have to do like this oop you need just need to freeze this one F4 to make sure when you go down there you don't lose the you just stay to this one great so you have the person percentage of item is going one by one and you'll see that it's incremental to up to 100% then the percentage of sales you do this so don't get this just type the the formula D4 divided by the total sales and you lock the formula with F4 with the dollars right Perfecto and then you do you do this one like this but for this one you will add plus the previous one boom then you do like this you double click and you have this incremental okay perfect and the last step is to define the conditions for that so I'm going to copy and paste this tab e I4 right and the formula is simple I'm going to copy and paste and explain you can just copy and paste if use the exact same position what is the formula if if my percentage of cell is less than 40% then it's an a code if it's less than 80% it's a b Cod otherwise that's a c Cod okay I just have one more condition to say like if this is empty if there is nothing here like if there is no item code then you just put this because you don't want to have a c code if there is no no space no item code here I have more space for the formula why because if you once again if you have more item coming you don't want to copy and paste this formula once again you want to have it as automatic as possible so I've done this multiple times I end this is the formula you can use you have the the percentage of items sometimes for some companies like you have one or two items that represent 50% of the of your Revenue if this is the case you can play with these numbers your ID is that in this specific we have 6% that represent 40 and 20 80 that's very very similar to the paror distribution but if you if you have like few items that represent way too much I recommend you it's not it's not a problem to change for example to 50 if you feel like you have only one two itm 240 okay so don't be afraid to change that if you the IDE is really to focus your energy on the most important but you can also adjust a little if you have way too many or not enough but I like this dist distribution it's almost almost the par analysis and then we just have to if you want you can create a graph you can create a graph with the this distribution inser there we go control X you have the graph there is also one question that people ask me should should you include this continued stock in your distribution you can decide yes or no I like to include everything because I feel like it's about selling if you are using the forecast it's even better because you will you will have less impact of your your pass sales but uh if you if you want to remove them you can just avoid them and and say that if they're not not discontin if they're not active they are C Cod automatically or you can have a specific classification for discontin stock for me it's not necessary because we already have this information on the on the left so I like to use all all my information you see that if I change that the distribution is almost the same but you have much less like slow sellers that don't sell anything all right so I'm going to go back to this yeah soorry there was one if I use active only it's a 722 if that's if I remove the the discontinued if I then it's it's quite similar so I will use everything but just to keep in mind you can add or a specific name for this continued or you can remove them if you don't feel they they should be part of the the focus of the company all right so we have this you can add the same visual if you want I just insert some objects you can copy and paste and then you just have to vcup here V lookup item code V lookup lookup from item code to ABC ABC six z uh and that's it and what you can do as well if you don't have all the product for example if you don't select the discontin stock you can say if error then uh you could decide or discontinued or you can just say c as well the C basically are not the focus of the company okay so we have this ABC analysis then I just add a conditional formatting for a b and c if it's a then it's green if it's B it's orange and if it's red it's it's a c why because it's very important to always focus on the most important and I will always like at the beginning of the week will say okay guys what is the situation for A and B code first of all regarding availability availability I'm going to select zero and that should be your focus right now what's happening what is the action plan I don't see any transit for many of this product we can go like this up and you can see we're going to see that later that you have urgent orders and you are losing money because of that because these products are out of stock so it's very useful to really focus you don't even have to to say okay but what is what are the top sellers blah blah you just filter A and B you fix your issues with A and B and then if you really have time you go to to C C because but most of the time we don't have time for that so it's very powerful to have this ABC analysis and for the dashboard as well if you go to the pivot I will always what I was doing before I will do it again here I will always do an availability brand not per brand but per ABC to see okay what is the situation for ab and c and I can tell you that the focus is to have much better availability for your top sellers because that this is the one that represent 40% or 80% of your Revenue new and they don't represent 80% of your inventory so that's an easy way to make much more money and most of the company forget that so please do it that's it
okay so now let's talk about average C this is one of the most important parameters underestimated and if you don't do it correctly that will crash the the all replenishment system so why it's important this is one of the whatever you're using like Safety stock or minmax we're going to use average sales and we need to do it in a good way right and for minmax just to give you the formula I'm going to get back to this after slowly but in the minimum formula you don't have much parameter but you have one called average sales that we're going to multiply by lead time and safety and it's important to have the right one again so how many days that's a real question that's a big deal how many days of average sales should I take one week average sales per per day um two weeks 3 weeks two months one year that's a good question and I'm going to I'm going to summarize that with this basically the more you have volumes and the more you have delivery frequency the more can be your average your average sales okay if you like at deat for example we were we had like two or three delivery per day in at the store and we were selling we had we had product that were selling a lot so in this specific case we could take 14 days average sales 7 to 14 days average sales if you for example have been working with a car accessories like on mainten products for maintenance and you had one sale sometimes once a month month once every two months in this case we have and the delivery was only one delivery per month for the supplier we were more into 6 months or up to 12 months um 12 months for the average sales so the good thing with shortterm it's very reactive so if you sell a lot the last few days the average sh is going to accelerate very fast you your your average sales will increase very fast that's also very volatile so if for example you have one someone coming to your store or your or you have a big production for your factory and you produce a lot of one specific item but it was just for a very specific order then you go back to zero you will create an a huge order to to your system that you don't really necessarily want so the good way it's very reactive like when you have something happening like in terms of business that is you need to follow it's good but sometimes it's too reactive and you will have too much stock on the other way if you have a long period for your average sales you will more stable so you you will avoid this uh noise but you won't be as reactive let's say you have a new trend for I don't know a specific color or yoga mat if you're using the last 12 weeks average sales uh it will takes six months maybe just to wake up and say okay now we need to we need to accelerate the sales so the decision really depend on sales volumes delivery frequency and there is no secet no secret again you need to test track and adjust but this is this is what you have to keep in mind okay different warnings very important warnings before we go back to excel sales is different from demand when I say average sales it should be average demand but everyone is using average sales why because if if you can have the information you are selling 80 but the demand was 100 but you had not enough stock for that you should use the demand and not the sales so in this specific example in Excel I don't have the demand I consider that my sales equal my demand but that's something very important to consider then the second one is short like one of the solutions should be for example or you have the demand from your customers or you use the what we call the the shortage or backorder uh service to readjust your average sales for example you have 80% um 80% availability you will say oh okay I have 20% of sales missing in my average sales you have to be very careful with that it's not as simple that's why I'm not going going to share examples right now because it can be very sensitive if you have like 0% or 1% availability you you don't necessarily want to multiply by 1999 so I just give you ideas and if you have more question I can do private I can do private consultation with you or I can share with my members but just to give you ideas another one is you have to be careful with business day and calendar day uh some company that are just open for five days a week others from seven days I always like to work in calendar day whatever you are you are working on you are working on that but you need to be very consistent if you use SC business day for your average average sales you should also use it for your average lead time and for all all all the rest of your calculation that's why I always recommend calendar day then you also have to be careful with exceptional sales um for example like I can give you example from Decat again you had like okay we are selling a ball for like soccer ball and uh you you sell maybe five or five or 10 balls every every day and one day one team wants to is buying 200 balls 200 balls okay so your average s is removed from maybe five days to two or maybe 50 or 70 a day because it's an average of the last seven days because of that you will have a huge order of soccer ball if you want to avoid that there is a solution but you need to have more code in the system and it's not that easy to do it in Excel is you could limit the number of sales per clients you could say like I'm going to take all the the sales but I will take I will cap to maximum three sales per client this is one of the tricks I was using for multiple companies I was doing the same for fashion industry for maintenance etc etc and there is another solution you could also use exponential smoothing exponential smoothing I'm not going to give you details but basically the last day is more has more weight than the the the days a long time before uh this is very good for acceleration and deceleration but it's much more complex to use and it's very volatile again so I don't really recommend this to start but once again if you want more information we can talk about it in private consultation uh okay so at the end ideally you should use for the average s you should use the the forecast and not the average sales if you already know what's going to happen it will be much more than to to use the P sales if you don't have a good if you don't have Focus or if you don't have Focus accuracy that will be good enough to start no reason for that but this is just to give you a full picture okay what are the the average says you have a lot of question beyond that how to manage the exception the difference between demon and sales or to manage the business day and calendar day and the exceptional peak of sale that could trouble your average sales you once again you need to try you need to test and you you will feel you will see it when it it looks it looks relevant for your company okay great so now let's go back to Excel and we're going to use this formula it's a very simple formula you will see you have average sales daily great and in this specific case we're going to use four weeks why because we have some volume but it's not it's not super super fast sales there either when you see this is the top sales quantity but you have also a lot of low sales you see like per per week one one so in this specific example uh we going to use four weeks quantity and we can we're going to try different ways and adjust if necessary but I like the four weeks and we're going to also use it for the seasonality after so this the formula is quite simple it's four weeks divided by the number of days so 4 * 7 and you have your average sales daily that we're going to use in the formula after for the minan Max uh formula but also we going to use a different one for the re point and Safety stock
now let's talk about the lead time this is one of the most important parameters in Inventory management clearly one one of the top three most important parameters with average sales and so we do have the average sales or the average demand that we're going to multiply by the lead time and the safety lead time we're can also use the Le this lead time for Safety stock and reorder Point okay so we have different lead time we have very very short lead time for example in the store between like the storage and um where you're going to sell the products you can have one or two or three days lead time with your suppliers if you have a distributor supermarket in the warehouse you have a very short lead time between the storage and the PE picking and packing it could be could be only few hours but you could also be a six month leak time with your suppliers in China or maybe few weeks between Mexico and and the US it really depends if you have the production the the supplier has to produce the product or not and for the factory is the same between the components and the prodct you can only have few hours but with your suppliers you could have two three four five six months okay so you have different time and this lead time will really Define once again what is the level of complexity that you need to implement because the longer is the lead time the longer will be your uncertainty regarding what you're going to sell and the also the relability of your suppliers okay so we are now in this in this situation but just to give you an idea we have a lot of confusion regarding the lead time many people think it's all about the transport so it's all about this part but it's much more than that the first thing that you need to consider and most of the time it's people will forget is what we call the review period if you don't check if you don't place order every single minute you need to consider what is your frequency if it's once a week you already have seven days of lead time just because you only place one order every week so don't forget this what we call period of frequency in your totality time then you could have some it confirmation to create for example what we call a purchase order po you could have the production then the packing and picking uh from the the warehouse or the production then you have to wait for transport because you can't ship immediately and we have we had a lot of problem the last few years regarding the congestion of the port in shangai or in Los Angeles for example where you like basically both were waiting for weeks to get the the products uh and then to ship them then you have the transfer then you have you can have one customer multi multiple custom challenges before having to transport again or consolidate to different distribution centers then you have to deliver and at the end you have not only you have to deliver but you have to confirm the delivery into your system so at the end before the I need the stock and I receive the products this is the total lead time in this specific example in this this the one we're going to use today it's a very simple one but in the next module in the next level experts and professional we're going to use long long-term lead time and we're going to have more tools to make sure that you can face the um uncertainty of this lead time but in this one it's very simple it's a short lead time we are talking about like a review period every day was once a day the replenishment time is 1 three and one for this specific brand and I just add this um this features called the safety lead time the safety lead time in this example we're going to use something very simple is like we're going to call it in the gut and in the next module we're going to use data to to Define this automatically but in this one you say Okay brand one my supplier for the Brand number one is very accurate is always on time so I don't need any safety but for this this one BR number two sometimes I have some issues and I really want to have safety so I'm going to put one days above this three three days lead time and for this one this one is really not accurate so you tell me one day but like 50% of the T 50% of the time I have two days so at the end you can Define you could also use 0.5 if you want you don't need to have something something like a with a run number but at the end what is important is what is the total time you have the review period plus the replenishment LM plus the safety L time and then I'll give you the total item two five and three and we're going to use this number in the formula for min max you also have this information for transport optimization free minimum order value and extra cost delivery but we're going to use that later no pressure so we go back to this smoothly we have the lead time and we just look up the lead time from the brand it could be supper 1 2 3 or four and we have the total Liam and this is the Liam what we're going to use so you see it's very simple but even if you have short lead time it's good to be very clear about your riew perod your lead time and if you want to have some safety this safety can have a lot of impact on your inventory level so make sure you you use it wisely you can also track the average lead time to adjust and remove the safety lead time if you feel that there is no much variation with the average lead time okay that's it for the lead time I see you for the next video
in this video we're going to talk about the load size and the mq for minimum order quantity this is a very important information because it's good to have a Mini Max for example a min max will tell you oh you need to order one quantity but you can't really get one quantity for example if you supply only Supply by box like this one 10 quantities or maybe just per pallet 120 quantity or maybe you need to fill a full container otherwise this is not profitable for you so what we have these two information what we call the size lot or lot size for like it's like would be the carton and the minimum other quantity would be the minimum for the supplier to supply you so he will say no no for me I don't I don't Supply less than one pallet or less than 10,000 quantity because I need to launch the production and it's won't be profitable for me this is a very important information and this is a very also important negotiation this is for me one of the main reason why company have Overstock it's because they don't really challenge the size of their lot and the size of the minimum order qualtity and I can tell you I will go back to this but if you need if I go back to minmax you need you say okay I need 50 and your mq is 80 or your load size is 80 at the end it's the same results you will have another stock just because of that of Sol quantity and that could be 100 quantity that could be sometimes 1,000 quantity you need you need a 15 in stock but you you need to order minimum 1,000 quantity and that that can have a massive impct impa on your inventory level okay just to give you an idea and I will go back to this in the expert level or to track the inventory turnover of your minimum order quantity but if your one year forecast is one quantities and your supply mq is 500 quantities you will have five years of inventory just because of that and I've seen so many example in my life for example in the Cosmetic industry uh sometimes we are to order for two or three or four years stock because it was impossible because of the the packaging because it was a specific language and the marketing was pushing no no we have to do it it's very important we need we need this product but from a supply chain point of view it was just it was just it didn't make any sense to to have it so be very aware of it in this specific example if I go back to the Excel file uh we have we have the lot we just have the lot we let's the because it's coming from a distribution center so we don't have lot size and minimal order quantity but you could also combine these two L size is basically is the multiple and minimum order quantity is the minimum but you can order plus order more if you want okay so you just V look up this information with this one and you will have in the superer tab here you will have the lot size and we're going to use the lot size after calculating the minan max that to show you in the formula you have the minan max then you're going to define the need I'm going to go back to this formula after but then the order quantity will be the Roundup of the need divided by the load size because it's important to uh respect what is the the multiple of your orders so in this case 70 quantities or 100 for this one so you need to have this information that's one of the main pillars it's very critical for for retail sometimes always one quantity but most of the time you need to have this multiple uh and also the Min minimum order quantity if you if you have that in the we're going to see that also in the L in this specific case we don't have minimum order quantity per item but we have free minimum order value it will be like $112,000 for Bron one 50,000 for Bron two so you can have per item like a load size and for supplier a minimum order value to make sure it's profitable for them and the extra extra cost for the delivery but I will go back to this after as well okay
I'm very proud of you because now we have all the parameters to start our first minmax Formula congratulation we have the itm list the St in transit the kpis service obsolute stock inventory turnover we have the average sales we have the average lead time we have the loot size we have the ABC analysis and now we can start having this Mini Max are you happy I'm happy great so what is the formula go back to this you have the minimum is average sales time lead time plus lead time and the maximum is a minimum mini multiply by fixed ratio that's it and once your stock reach the minimum you to the maximum and to be completely honest you don't check this all the time so usually most of the companies if they have a very short lead time they will do it every day if they have a long lead time they will do it at least once a week or once a month if they have very very long lead time that's the reality of the business okay so if I go back to the file let's go back to the base so I'm going to start with a simple way to calculate minan max and then we'll have in the next module I'm going to we're going to go back with more parameters with seasonality and Target service so it's normal if in the file you have more information that you should see we see about what is this optimized service Target I'm going to explain this in the next module relax but I really want to keep it simple because with this formula very simple formula you can already start optimizing your inventory you don't have to to do everything I'm going to explain to you at the next few days okay amazing so what is the mean the mean is we're going to do it in a simple way first so I'm going to insert another one main symol simple with great and my main symbol is my average sales where is my average sales daily multiply by my lead time total lead time so that include the safety and the review period and that's it that's my minimum let me check the formula yeah because I have my safety minimum simple and then the question is okay but what is the ratio what is the ratio minan Max and you have multiple options you can have a very simple way and you can have a more complex way a very very very simple way is you have one number for all your products you have one number for all your prod you will for example multiply by two Why by two because you want to optimize you don't want to order every day or every a minute you want to optimize the transport and the the service and the the basically the bigger will be the ratio the more you will optimize uh your your your volume with your suppliers and the transport but also the the bigger will be your ratio the bigger will be your safety kind of your safety stock and that will increase your your your stock value from my personal experience a good ratio is between 1.5 and 2.5 okay uh so you don't have to trust me you can just experiment and try uh but I really recommend you could start simply by just say my mini is 73 and I'm going to multiply by for my simple Max I'm going to insert here Max I'm going to do 73 time 2 okay it's just multiply by two that's a very very simple way to start and once your stock plus Transit is equal to 73 then you're going to order up to 146 and you're going to round up with your Lo size so in this case it will be Round Up by 70 okay so that's a very very simple way I have another solution for you is you're going to focus more on your most important item so you can see we have the ABC analysis here and we're going to do like simple ratio and the simple ratio will be 1.5 for cods two for B cods and 2.5 for a Cod so we're going to add more safety uh for a cods and we will have also more volumes of course we will increase the safety for the top sellers that's if you think they're more predictable that's a risk but we're going to cover that in the professional model but I feel this is a very safe way to start if you don't know if you don't know how to start and anyway the SEC because they have very low volume so you won't order this one a lot so I just V look up 2.52 and 1.5 in my tab this is what we call the ratio mean Max simple and it's just a v cod with ab and C code that's it so you do a and C code here and you have your mean and your max okay so you can multiply this Max times simple one and that will change automatically all your uh mean Max and then to order let's see what is this Max 2 round up Max I'm going to remove this one as well so you have the rum in Max and the max here and I'm going to change that to so what is this Max 2 is because I have a first Max Max Syle okay Max great so we have this minan and Max and then when the Stock press Transit is less or equal than to minimum it will order to Max and then round up with the load size and the quantity to order is basically the need so I'm I'm going to go back to this in the next module with what are the definition of orders etc etc but I just want to introduce you that if you feel it's already too much for you like to go further you can stop with this very simple method and try it and if you feel that you can go further then you can check the next module after but that's a good way to start and then I will explain to you all to optimize and the need is quite simple is that it looks complicated but it's not it's like if the stock and the transit is less than the max then you will order the difference if not you put zero and if my product is discontinued there is no uh need because that's an old old product and to the other quantity will be just the r up of the need divided by the load size and you will R up by the load size that's it so you can repeat the formula and you will have what you need let's check one for example this one you have a minan Max you have a mean of 43 you have a Max of 98 and so your need is two because your stock plus Transit equal let's check that stock and Transit equal 96 so you need two products but your slot size is 10 so you are going to order 10 that's it so that was the the first um the first modu was really to introduce you okay what you need to order in a very simple way and the simple way will give you probably 40 50% of performance if you start from zero there will be a there will be an amazing start but if you want to go further I'm going to give you more uh more tools to integrate the target service the seasonality and if you want to go even more further in the professional level we're going to go to Dynamic and Safety stock so thank you for watching this one and I see you for the next modu we're going to go deeper with the same Excel file
[Music] okay so now we have a simple minmax we're going to go to a dynamic Mig Max to make it even more efficient and also more efficient if you have long longer longer link time than one two or 3 days um you don't have to go to this um level if you feel it's already too much for you but I'm going to show you every steps up to a dynamic Safety stock to become an expert so what is what is now we're going to start talking about Target service and seasonality the seasonality will help us to see the future to anticipate the future if it's going down or if it's going up okay and then we're going to move to a dynamic mid Max to have even more performance and to have something much more efficient especially if you have strong variation uh regarding your your seasonality and also if you if you really want to secure your your your safety stock if you have like if you have a strong variation between different products all right so let's talk about seasonality first so the new formula know is average sales multiply by late time multiply by the coefficient of seasonality and what is the seasonality what is the seasonality the seasonality so if you go back to this file you have this tab called seasonality and in this tab you have this beautiful graph wow so what why seasonality is important let's say that you use your we are week 41 here and you're using the average sales for the last four weeks so the this is the sales for the last four weeks I'm going to zoom okay so this is the sales for the last four weeks let's say for one specific product but you can see that the next the next four weeks let's say for example it's after Christmas you are selling a lot uh let's say this is this is not Christmas but let's say it's Christmas you are selling a lot uh during Christmas but after Christmas your your sales are are crashing really fast and if you only use the past sales you will you will have this this trend that you you will are the way too much after the peek and you won't accelerate as fast before the peek so when you accelerate here I want to to go faster than my average sales when I'm going down I want to anticipate that okay I'm going to do less just in this specific case we are doing minus 31% versus the last four weeks and the next four weeks so this is this coefficient that we want to multiply with the average s to say okay you you sold under quantity the last four weeks but next four weeks your your trend is 71 quantity so minus 31% okay I hope this is clear and this is just one example and what we're going to do we need to Define seasonality uh for different group of products to to to connect with the average sales and then to link to the formula Min minmax okay so why how do we do seasonal that's a really good and not an easy question because you have multiple way to do seasonality I'm going to do a very simple way and usually the simplest is the is the is the best uh because Can it can be quite complex if you have a lot of products one of the key element for seasonality is you need to have a group of products with the same behavior for example when I was working for the catlon we had the running um we had the running brand so every sport accessory for running and in this brand we had accessories for summer and accessories for winter and if you would only take the seasonality what is the seasonality basically is you can see this is the revenue per per brand and the seasonality is just this is not the value it's the percentage because it's not easy it's not always easy to compare different um Trends because they don't have the same value so you can have one brand who will sell for example $1,000 a week and another brand will sell $1 million a week and they are very very different so we we we're going to convert all this value into percentage to a base 100 percentage maybe you've done that before we're going to do it again slowly no worries but what is important is to have a group of products that are very similar for example if I was if I would take for example the running uh running sales there would be something quite flat because you will sell some quantity in Winter some quantity in summer but at the end will be quite flat but if you separate the winter products and the summer products you will have a big curve in Winter for winter products and we will have a big peak in summer for summer Peri and these two kind of compensate for the full year okay so we want to have different products with the same behavior some some products will have all the same behavior some of them will be very different but it's imp for me it's impossible impossible to have one seasonality per products because the sales are too low and you will have this for example let's take one example for example let's take one example that's a good example uh let's take a big cell for example this one oops that was not what I wanted to do insert okay I have too many products I'm going to copy and the just to give you few examples file new if I take item one that's the the trend of item one right so why not so that's the opposite the on the left you have the latest and on the the right you have the the soonest let's take for example not this this one insert you have a different pick right very different ones let's take now a very very low sell and the the the main problem are with these kind of products in set randomly you see like you could be out of stock it could be something like a promotions new price so it's very very difficult to have one seasonality per products because they are all very different and most of them don't sell much if you I remember remind you in the ABC analysis what is really important is the A and B the c c they just have few sales sometimes and you don't want to overthink uh the season IDE or even the forecast for low low low sales prod because at the end they just in one or two quantities in your Warehouse or in your store or in your factory okay so it's better to have a group of produ product and the bigger is the group the the the most easier will be to have like something smooth for your seasonality but you don't want something too big because otherwise you're going to lose the effect for example summer winter if you have the same same all these prodcts in the same group you will lose this effect of seasonality so I could spend 20 hours talking about seasonality but I won't do it because I want to keep it simple what is very important it's not only a supply chain job you should have you should have groups of products that are very similar together and it's not only a sulation it's a marketing and product management strategy as well as well it's the same when you do promotion you do promotion on a specific group of category of products so they should have the same behavior then it's easier to to plan it's easier for the pricing strategy and for the distribution as well so in this specific case I will always recommend first of all to check what is the global trend of the company so for example this is the global Trend that we're going to do the red one and then if you feel that yeah but if if you know by experence that you have you have group of RS that have completely different seasonality or TR or curve you should isolate this group it's better if they already part of the when we go back to the base of it could be a brand a category a family would be much easier so I would recommend first to know how many groups you need to have I would do a curve per if I go back to seasonality just do a curve of revenue for brand for your different brands or category or family then do it in a lower level then in a lower level if you feel that this curve are quite relevant you could keep them if you feel like you you start having this kind of of curve and they're not it's it's kind of messy that that means that you want to find the level of details okay so it's very important that you really understand the the the the level of details the bigger is the easier but the the big the bigger is your group the less intensity will be in terms of seasonality and coefficient and to start I think this is the best way so for example I was working with a um a car parts company they were doing also maintenance and it was basically the same seasonality for all the products it was mostly everything before summer before people going to to on holidays and we just had one specific product for winter products everything wrting to car uh to care for winter products it was only like something like 50 items so we did one B group and one for 50 items for winter products and that's it in this specific case we're going to do brand one brand two and brand three and that's what we're going to do in the next video in Excel I'm going to explain to you how to create first the Bas 100 then the coefficient of seasonality and then how to connect with the min max
all right so now let's start and do this coefficient of seasonality what we're going to do you need to have as much history as possible so you could you could have it per item or you could have it just at the Brand level if you use the brand or category level okay so in this specific case I just have one year history if you check my sales I just have one year history so this is not enough for my seasonality so in this specific case I don't have per item it's not important to have it per item so I have if you go to seasonal I have my CS for brand one brand two brand three and I my total my total is just the sum of BR one two and three only have two three brands what I was explaining before you should use your current category and see if they looks if they look coherent or not in before checking your seasonality so you just starting by doing this curve I just did a graph of my Bron one so what you do you just do that don't take the total insert boom and you have this okay oop great you can double click have this color so this is the revenue for Bron one for Year 2007 18 19 20 and 21 the 21 is not full because in this data set I don't have 21 yet s it's here sorry you can see up I have data missing so the 21 is interesting but I don't feel I I could use it for my seasonality let me check that yeah I don't feel I could use it for my seasonality so what we going to do first so we're going to take it for Bron one Bron two and bronze three you should do the same I should you should ask your accounting and finance department if you don't have all this information I feel that five years is a good is a good is a good way four four years four full years is a good way to start if only have two it's okay but it's better to have three four or even five or six unless you had a you had a huge event happening during a specific year if you feel for example like covid was a complete mess for your Sal history maybe you should remove uh this this year that make no sense you can also correct the history if you had a huge pick one year for example World Cup when I was working with spos company like the Caton we had a huge Peak for World Cup once every four years and we didn't want to use this seasonality uh this seasonality um one once we have the peak so we are removing the the year with the World Cup and we're using your seasonality without the World Cup okay so have a look on the curve and if you see that one is crazy or you had massive out of stock or you have so many products coming to the new category because also what is important is to have stable category if you start adding 100% a new products in your category you will have much more sales but it doesn't make sense because it's it's because of the the number of products not the consistency uh not the increase of the the current product so you you have some cleaning to do but just observe the curve and you will see and if it's too complex go to the a bigger level maybe at the company level to start so we have this I'm going to remove this and what we're going to do first we're going to do an average so we just do an average of the the the the full years you have I'm not using 2021 because 2021 is not full not completely over and I don't want to to have something that is too influenced by half of the year so I'm just using the average sales of oops the average sales of the last four years 2017 to 2020 that will give me this this curve iner this is the average sales for the last four years full four years okay this is good but what I don't like I don't like this PE you know like okay this is not something because at the end you don't want to to increase your stock by 20% and the week after to reduce by 20% you want something smooth what we call smooth how to do something smooth we're going to smooth the sales and to smooth the sales what you going to do you just have to do the average of one week before one week after and one week in between you could also do two weeks before two weeks after and the current week you could also do this work per month so all my file is based on weekly sales but you could also do it in a monthly and this is one of the exercise you're going to do just after that okay so we're going to do average so I'm going to do it with you average just check the formula up and that will give me something a bit smoother just for the the first week and the last one you just have to take these two plus the last one here and for this this one let me check if I'm I'm correct you take the last two and the first one and you divide by three okay make sense so now let's see how it looks insert sorry for all this graph I want to keep it for you because it's easier to see now you see you have the normal one you have the normal one here and you have the average sales and you have the smooth s you see that this curve is much better I mean much much stable I don't say better but stable right and this is the one we want to use now we still have this um seasonality in value and it's not really a seasonality it's just a smooth sales average I want to have now what we call the base 100 and what is the base 100 the base 100 is very simple once again is I'm going to remove this I want to just divide this value by the average that's it so I do equal this divided by the average of the full column and by doing that okay great so I'm going to I just need to freeze this formula F4 and F4 boom perfect and you just copy and paste the formula and that's it and you will have a b00 what does it mean if you for example this one let's see if for example this one is close to 100% 146 is very close to the average of the year so if I select the full year my average is like you see 14672 and if you are very close to that for example this one you are very close to the average sales of the year so you it's 101% 101% means that you are you are in the average basically this one for example let's move me this one for example you are way below the average 72 so you are 72% of a normal um normal week for this specific brand and we're going to use this coeffic this base 100 then I'm going to remove that to create what we call the base 100 so I'm going to show you the graph I'm going maybe a bit fast but it's very simple you just have to repeat now you see we have the same curve than before but no it's not value it's percentage so it's the the same shape than the red one but no it's a it's percentage and it's easy because then we can compare different groups and you can also use a ratio to calculate okay what is the acceleration or the deceleration great so next we have this B but what is also very important is you need to know I was showing that in this gra okay am I am I doing I know what is my level today am I 70% of a normal read but what is what is in front of me am I going even down or I am going up and my I need to anticipate that my sales are going up and I will have to to increase my stock in my store or in my factory so for that we use what we call a coefficient of seasonality what is a coefficient of seasonality for example for this minus 8% we just going to divide what is the next after 76 what is my current read 83 so I'm going down by 8% that's just a division between these two minus one we call it weak Plus plus one because it's only one week difference if you are using the one week average sales you should use the plus one week if you use like we use in this current file the last four weeks average sales let me check which one we're using yeah we use the last four weeks average sales you should consider the last four weeks and then you see okay what is going next for the next four weeks and then multiply by this coefficient right so I'm going going back to seasonality and for this this one is a bit more complex you're going to make the sum of the next four weeks divided by the sum of the last four weeks minus one and that will give you a coefficient of seasonality okay that means that if you are in week sorry for this graph I'm going to remove this after T tck tck in week 41 what is my week 4 1 here we go by week 41 you have minus 31% what is Theus 31% is basically this so the average no no sorry this so 73% divided by 105% okay and you have this 31% and this is the this coefficient that you're going to multiply to the average sales if you want to do I'm going to remove this t t t t t great if you want to do two eight weeks you will have to do the same principle last eight weeks versus a eight next week so you have to do it once manually but then it's ready to go and you don't have to do it anymore okay so I'm going to do it I'm going to clean this you can do the same for every single brand so I have done it for brand two brand three and you can also use it for the total I I'm not going to use the total in my minmax but let's say for example you have a new category or you have products that they don't relate they don't they're not really related to a specific category you could say okay for these specific groups I'm going to I'm going to use the total SE coefficient seasonality okay perfect so I know it can be a bit too much for today but it's not that complex you just you just need to make it again and I really recommend you to do the next EX exercise and it will be much easier when you're going to practice by yourself so we have the brand one we have first of all you get the the dollars or the Euros or the whatever is your currency then you move back to base 100 then you calculate the coefficient of seasonality and the last step is to link to your uh table so to link to your table let's go back to the base we're going to open this you have the seasonality four weeks okay so the the seasonality four weeks you see R -2 -2 - 31 and what what is that it's just a vup of the brand and the current week so how do we do that it's just a concatenation of these two V lookup and brand and seasonality but to make this link you have multiple option but what I did I did a link uh link table and the link table is what going Zoom the link table is just the week the brand and the coefficient of seasonality for example for this one and I just create a link between this one and this one equal so you have to do it once manually but then even if you had two or three or four years more hisory you don't have to do it this again so you have the the this is just like a database that you can V look up in this specific case it's very complex because you will have a v cup for brand one here then here and the V cup won't work because you will have different colors for according to the the brand the brand that you are looking for so I'm going to go back to the base and I will do it again slowly the coefficient of seasonality here is V lookup and what are you looking for you you're looking for two combination you're looking for the brand and the weak number to get the weak number I'm going to it's just a just a trick if we go back to the sales pivot that we are using in the previous videos you can see that the my latest week is on the on the Left Right 2021 41 how do I get the latest week automatically it's coming from the sales and to get this you just do write formula oop of this cell and you want the two characters and that's it you have 41 and this is the the latest three because this is the one that is coming when you update the file okay so this is the formula I was using 41 is the same formula right or sales pivot and to have the seasonality you just do video cap of brand and Weck number you're going to log this and then we go back to seasonality and we can select this and we're going to select one two 3 four or you can select the table it's up to you let's select the table and then we're going to select five and zero great so I don't think it's going to work yes why because I need to invert I need to have the week number first and then the brand great now now it's working and just to to keep in mind that I create this link what is the link is just a concatenation between week and Brand number okay so I did this for brand one brand two and brand three and now I can create the link and get automatically my coefficient number for plus one plus 4 and plus eight if I change my mind I say no I want to use the the the average set for eight weeks what I'm going to do I'm going to just change this five to six and I will automatically change all my coefficient you see it's a it's a bit of excel but once you get it then you are you are free to go you just have to do it once and then you can multiply in the mini the new mini will be here it will be the average sales daily multiply by one plus the coefficient of seasonality one one plus because if you are going by minus 6% it's only minus 6% so you don't want to multiply by 6% you want to do 1 minus 6% to have 94% so we're going to reduce the average size daily by 6% multiply by the lead time okay so just rep slowly and that was one of the longest video but at the end this is something quite simple average size multiple by the coefficient of seasonality you just have to Define how many weeks of sales for your average sales and then apply this formula so just to conclude what is important at the end is we're going to multiply a coefficient of seasonality and between for example brand two the brand two is going minus 31% while brze three is going by plus 2% so the impact on your minmax and on your in will be the difference between different brand could be in this case 33% different that's why it's quite powerful so at the end the conclusion of that is you will see that we have different behaviors at the end it's you can see that we have a peak around at the end of the year maybe Christmas and we have a peak for for summer but you can see that the Brand number two has a huge Peak uh in the middle of the year and it's crashing a lot at this time when like in week 41 you can see that the bronze 3 is quite stable so that's why it's very interesting and once again it's the quality of the group that will give you the quality of the seasonality but if you feel that it's you don't have enough data is too compx just keep it simple start with a normal one seasonality for the full company of the full group of products and the the more you will learn about it the more you will maybe classify and change your product but sometime can take months or years to to convince as well your marketing team and product team to change the category of your products okay so I hope you enjoy we'll have another exercise just after uh but this is one of the most important principle that we can also use use um to forus the products
in this video we're going to talk about service Target ABC ratio what what this is about so before we had only one ratio mean Max and this ratio was just mean was with a specific ratio and what we're going to do now we're going to we're going to split this ratio into different categories just to go back to the principle we all want to have a good service and avability for the customers but we also want to minimize the inventory and the more you will have stock the the more you will improve the service but at one point it will be very difficult to reach 100% it's impossible you need an infinite stock to get 100% of of um service so you have this kind of we'll say profit because at one point you'll have way too much stock and this stock will impact your profit your storage your promotion your etc etc so you need to find this balance point and this balance balance point can be for me a very different in according to the the products you are selling if you I'm using this example a lot if you like if you sell a t-shirt but it's the same for components or any products or raw material you have like prod it's aod clearly the most basic products are most of the time the most important so you want to have 90 Almost 100% of availability for these products but on the other hand you have fancy products that you you know you do test it's Innovation you don't really know what's going to happen but you want to try and this one is not a big deal if they're not available or if the customer they have to wait for it okay uh so at the end you could have for example two or three targets like one for a Cod one for B Cod and one for C Cod three different targets okay and that's what we want to do and what we're going to do so before in the in the previous module I was explaining okay let's just R the ratio minan Max two then I was explaining maybe you can just split 2.52 and 1.5 that's where we're going to need to start that's a very good way to start in a very simple way and then you can adjust if you feel you need more stock or less that's by implementing that you will know but I wanted to tell you about okay but let's talk about service right not ratio but service and you say Okay I want 90% of um of availability or or service right or maybe I I would like to have 95 for my a code for my B code I want 90 and for my C code 80 you it's very important that you accept it's critical in your mind and and you also need to educate your company that it's not possible and is not profitable if to have 100% of availability and service and you really need to sacrifice a group of product and most of the time you need to sacrifice the less important one but the less important one most of the time represent more inventory so I always recommend you to keep this in mind and then you can adjust the value but it's very important everyone is on the same page what is important for the company and what is less important sometimes the c c you don't even have to have stock you could just say I don't have safety or you could just say my client they need to to conf to pay me before I order to my supplier where where start the production in my factory okay very important so for that we're going to use what we call a minan Max Dynamic mixmax with the target service level and I'm going to get back to my abc so I was explaining before it was just here you can you have the ABC and we were using the simple ratio 1.5 to 2.5 okay so if I go back to my base to my simple Max and my ratio is here I just did a v c of ABC and I will get okay if it's an a Cod 2.5 if it's a two if it's a b and it's a see if it's 1.5 okay this is by experiment but you can adjust these parameters you don't have to change here you can change directly into this file to say no I want three on this item and if you go back you will have three and you will increase the mean max value okay but now let's talk about service targets and for the service Target you see we have 95 90 and 85 and we have a new ratio oh what is this ratio 2 2.64 2.28 and 2.04 for that we're going to use what we call the normal distribution what is the normal distribution I I want to keep it simple the normal distribution will give you like a probability uh to um to reach the the demand or not what what is the the no distribution what are the main principle it's a mathematic low that is very common and this mathematic law has few principle the first one it's a s symetric law so you for example if you sell your average sale is 100 you have as much chance to sell less than 100 than more than 100 tomorrow so this area has the same probability that this one also you have more probability to sayell 101 tomorrow than 400 or three quantities okay so you can see that the the biggest is the shape the more is the higher is the probability okay and the middle is your average basically the middle is your average let's say you you sell 100 you have the the most probability to sell tomorrow is still 100 and then the the the the the more distance you have from the average the less you have the probability to sell it okay so if you want to cover let's say 90% of your of your of your demand 90% you will say okay you are here and with this if you want to cover 90% you need to cover all this probability and the low will give you a ratio and this ratio will give you like it's something you're going to multiply to cover to face against uncertainty and for example in this specific case if you want to have 90% you have a a formula called Norms Norms ins coming from the the normal distribution that we give give you okay the ratio is 1.28 if you want to cover only 50% of it let's say 50% here you will have zero you will have zero that mean that you just want to cover to the average and in this specific case it will be the min max that we were you you you don't want to have any you don't want to have any uh you want mean equal to Max okay so it's just to give you an overview of what what we want to do but just to give you an idea this is not the perfect load that we give you exactly what's going to happen because you have so much elements and inputs that can really influence your demand but this is just a tool that will help you to defend approximately what is the best ratio for you if you are targeting 90% it doesn't mean that you will have exactly 90% of availability in your warehouse but I will give you like the the the direction and the tcy basically the more you see like the more you're getting closer to 90 91 or 100% the more the the value is is increasing exponentially to move from just 98 to 91 I need to increase by 0.3 one in this case I just need to increase by 0.6 0.06 so if you do this curve I'm going to do this curve set you see that the the closer you're going to 100 the the stronger is the ratio okay great so we have this probability you can Define you can play with this number and at the end what is the mini mini Maxi ratio you just do this coefficient that we call Z plus one and I will give you something a ratio that you can use according to a Target service level this is not perfect nothing is perfect but this is a good way to start and this is a good way to start playing with this normal distribution in the next module with safety St I'm going to use this um normal distribution again and I will give you VOA uh the advantage and disadvantage of using this distribution this distribution is not perfect but it's a good way to start great so now we go back to ABC and let's we're going to use the same formula so we're going to use the norm Norms in Formula plus one and you can change this parameter for example like this let's say we want 80% for this and automatically I will have a ratio Min and you can see it's quite it's quite close to the one was I was spelling manually but you can play with that if you want to change automatically for example no I want 82 I will get I will get you that or if I want 60 50 I will get one so my mean will be equal to my Max okay so we have this three we have this and now we're going to link this ratio min max to the file and what we're going to do so here we have the fix so you could only use one fixed service Target if you don't want to split a b and c and in this case you will have you will use the formula with this number but in this in this one I will say let's use a separate one for a b and c and we're going to use optimize service Target ABC and for this case the ratio mean Max will be the formula we are talking about of this specific ratio for a is 95 for B it's 90 for C it's 80 and we have the different dynamic mean Max ratio according to the ABC classification and at the end we have a different Max you don't have to see that all the time but you have a different minmax according to the ABC so you will have more safety and more inventory for your more strategic produ you could also decide to do the opposite I don't recommend that if you are not used to invent Inventory management policy in the professional module we're going to talk about how to also consider the the demon and certainty with the BC XY Z classification but that's a very good way to start once again I'm repeating myself but it's not a big deal if you start this way this is this is perfect to start okay so great we have a min max know that is dynamic according to ABC and different targets you can obviously adjust according to what you're going to track every every week you're going to check the the percentage of availability and you will be able to to adjust to see oh I feel know I have way too much for my echo so I can reduce by two or three three three point and once again in the next man I'm going to explain to you how to optimize how to tune and to see what is the impact on my inventory by touching these parameters we're going to see that in the expert module but um you can you can set this way you don't have to track everything at the beginning that's it for this video
okay so now let's talk about which quantity how many quantities to orders and also when to order because these two are very related as I was explaining before so we go back to the minmax on the paper you should only order when the the stock plus Transit is equal to minimum or less then it will trigger an order to the max okay that's the theory but on the paper if you do that you may have to order every single minute for every single item or you don't know that was was that what I was explaining before you have a variable period to Max you will only order when you reach 20 but when you need to check every maybe every minute that you do not reach the minimum for maybe 10,000 items so I don't I don't think this is sustainable unless you have an automatic replenishment I was doing that with the St but even with the with like a big distribution Network we were running this calculation not every minute but every every 4 hours or one we movement of the stock for every specific item so for example I will run the calculation the mini Maxi only if there is a a sell or if there is new stock coming into the the store of the warehouse but I will not do this and this check every single second for every single item right so the other option to say okay I'm going to I'm going to run this uh this file only once a week but if you do once a week you may have some issues you are above 20 at this time so you don't you don't put any order and you you have to wait wait maybe 5 days without any stocks before uh passing a new order to the max so that's that's why I always what I was talking before I recommend to have this hybrid version then you're going to check for example this file every week but if you have urgent orders you won't wait for the next Monday you will you will play this file and you will run this file only on specific items or only for the the itm with the most uh the biggest value to make sure that you don't you don't lose too much sales with your your clients okay so we're going to Define two different types of orders we have the Urgent orders if the stock when you want to check if you need to order if the stock is below the minimum then all the Urgent up to the max is urgent if it's above for example this example you have the current stock you don't need to order right now but you still have a need you have a need to say okay I maybe have 50 quantities my mini is is a 20 but I already have a need to the Max and you will also have the r up of the load size who will maybe increase the quantity so we will have two kind of of products I'm going to give you example just after so if I go back to the formula before checking Excel the you have different formulas for the max whatever the one you're using what is important is to really defend what is the stock the stock is the available stock so if you do have any ping orders with your customers you should not consider you should remove this quantity from the available stock I was explaining that before but it's really important if you have one other quantities but 50 already confirmed and ready to ship to a customer your available stock is not 100 your available stock is 50 okay you need then if you have urgent in and normal needs if your stock plus Transit is more than Max then you don't have any need if your stock plus Transit is less than the max then the need is the difference between these two Max minus stock plus trans this is not urgent and for the Urgent if your your your Stock press Transit is is more than the mean you have nothing have nothing Ur and if the stock PR is less than the mean then the full order up to the max is ur because I don't want to split if I want to order something I don't want to split into into two different orders okay so that's the principle and then the qualties to orders you have to be careful you don't want to have any discontinued stock so you want to only orders on active items with need more than zero and then after that you need to run up if you need for example nine quantities but your loot size is 10 you need to run up to 10 so that's what you're going to do now in Excel and I was mayit a bit fast but it's not that complex you see on this file you have the need you have the order quantity you have the ENT order quantity and that's it and then you have the ENT order quantity and sorry in value okay so we're going to do that we have this minmax whatever the the formula you're using the simple one the target service Ratio or the fixed ratio you will use the same principle and after that we have the need so the need need is just I put some description here and you have stock plus Transit if stock plus Transit less than Max then this is the need so you do Max minus stock plus Transit if not zero you have the the need of in in quantity then you have what you want to race in like with the load size so you're going to round up you're going to divide the need by the load size for example in this specific case you need is 1232 quantities but you want to run up to 1233 because your Lo size is three in this case your your Lo size is 30 so you want to run up to 270 and the formula you just divide the need by the loot size you round up this that will give you a run number let's do one here just to give you an idea so we're going to do this divided by 30 right so we have 8.7 we need 8.7 lot but we want to round up this 8.7 round up because I want to have run load size so my 8.7 become 9 and then my 9 I will multiply Again by my Lo size and I have 270 okay it's not complex just have to do it once so we have this need run up with the load size and then we do the same we do the same principle for um to check if my stock is less than my minimum for for this one is everything below Max for this one is everything below minimum and we always fill up to the max round up load size so we have order quantity and we have urgent order if you don't have the capacity or if you don't have money we only focus on the Urgent order quantity if uh if you really want to optimize your suppliers or your transport cost you want for example for Bron one you want to have all your needs you will have it will be wiser to to fill all your quantities up to the Max and that's the way we're going to work and then we're going to consulate all of this into the dashboard and you will be able to see okay how much of urgent orders do I have how much of normal orders do I have and if this is enough for my minimum order or not and some sometimes is it some sometimes it's not for example in this case we going go back to Brand two for example uh if you only feel the the ERS less than the mean you have $47,000 and your minimum is 577 so you will probably F to 70,000 to be able to avoid this minimum orders and to also avoid extra cost for that okay so that was the example how to identify the need the best way for you is to practice and to check this formula slowly but then at the end it's very simple you can check very fast okay what is what are the most urgent orders and this is the one you have item 18 then item 65 and basically you don't have much to order but this one are very because all this one have stock for example this one let check this one all this one they have zero stock all their their stock is very low like for example 84 quantity in stock and my my minimum is 131 so I really need to raise this order as soon as possible and not necessar like in this specific file the Le time is quite short so I would not wait one week to order but that's just give you an ID and then you can just play with these numbers and if you feel that they're too low you can also adapt the ratio minan Max okay that's it in the next one I'm going to explain to you how to optimize better but I was just to explain to you the the calculation
in this video I'm going to talk about a question I received from my members I I got this question many many times it's about okay but what if my mean Max equal to zero I I won't have any stock I won't have any orders so let's take few example let's go to Max equal zero boom okay so I remind you the the formula of the max is very simple it's just we're going to multiply the mean by the Max and also I didn't I didn't explain before but it makes sense for me to run up to have a wrong number for me and for Max okay so you can see the r up R up is just to to have the the the the full the full number above that will have an impact on your stock but for me it makes sense when you want to to have a r up number so I did the same for the max R up and you just multiply the ratio by the mean and in this specific case we have a lot of Max with zero why because we have a lot of discontinued stock and I I remind you that if my product is discontinued then we going to we're going to just put zero because we don't want to order obsolete stock okay so let's remove the discontinu one let's just take the active one great so now we do have the active one and we see we have minimum and maximum equal to zero why do we have that the formula is very simple we have that because we don't have any sales for the last four weeks so this is this is the reason for these products it's not a big deal because we do have stock quantity but for these two we don't have any stocks available and that's that's a problem because that means that you want anything else automatically so basically you could have all of stock for the rest of your life for these products and this is not necessarily something you want so you have two option for these two items let's see the first one the first one as you can see we were selling a lot before I know we don't sell we don't sell any products anymore why do we have that you have two option for that or there is a global shortage and we can't have these products anymore and we forgot to to raise new orders or this product is maybe not part of the active products it's maybe a discontinued product but we just forgot to update the file so you could check this manually that's one option but it's critical to have the right information for for each status of each product or you could uh you could add another condition and I'm going to do it not to say okay even if my minan Max equal Z I want to have 01 the minimum zero so means that one might stock come to zero I can other one but I don't want to have z0 because I want to make sure to have at least one products for every um for one one quantity for every products okay that's that's a big decision that you have to take and you also have to evaluate what will be the value of the stock but otherwise you will just never never raise any others unless you have one customer worth for the products and you have to do a manual order okay so how to do that we're going to do it from the top we don't we won't touch the mean Max formula because we want to keep zero but for the the max the mean formula but for the max what we're going to do we're going to copy we're going to say if my um this equal zero we're going to do an end so if this equal zero and my salue is active equal active then I'm going to put one otherwise this let's see if it's working oh I forgot one parth if and I forgot this one boom so now let's go back to the mean zero this now active one okay so now you see we have 0 one perfect and now we need to raise orders for these products the only problem you see like for example for this one before we orders now we need to raise 18 the need is one but we need to to raise 18 quantities because of the the lot size of the product so that that will be probably an over stock because we're not selling these products a lot right now but I recommend to do that the only challenge for example in the retail industry this decision of 01 or maybe 02 or one two or 13 for for the products that you don't sell can have a massive impact on your inventory because 80% of your products don't sell uh for the last seven days for example and because they are very very low sales you have to be very cautious with with the decision of your very with your low sales moving from minmax to 01 to for example one two or 13 manually could increase your your inventory Global by 20 or 30% so be very mindful check what will be the impact on the on your orders to to make sure that you won't you won't just kill the cash flow of your company and also be very cautious you should also have a review of your lower sales and inventory return to maybe decide to not to order specific items to to have it only available ready to order with no stock in your store in your factory if you feel that they are not profitable because of the mq because they they only sell maybe one or twice a year okay so that was a very important question I wanted to to raise with you and I see you for another video
in this video we're going to talk about um we're going to create this Supply Report with all this information this urgent orders and also what is the oos risk what is oos risk is out of stock risk in sales value okay so I'm going to start with that then we're going to calculate we're going to create this dashboard so if I go back to my base you can see we have this oos risk how do we Define when we have a risk I think it's very important for the business to know okay what are we going to lose in terms of sales if you do nothing if you don't have stock for that we have this formula it looks complex but it's not I'm going to take one example before let's see where you have this mean and Max and your current stock is below than the mean because it's below than the mean today because you not you are not you are not raising order every single minute and sometimes you just sell a lot and you say okay I'm below I'm below my even if I the re points at me I I couldn't raise the order before in this case you have a risk because you are below like technically you me minimum is only enough for the average Sales Plus the lead time plus one maybe one day safety lead time in this specific case but you have a risk of losing money and we're going to quantify okay but what is this risk for example if you sell 10 products a day you have three days delivery and you have only 10 quantities left you may lose 20 quantities because you need three days to get your stock back into your your your factory or into your stores or or if you have an Ecommerce business okay so we're going to quantify this number and this number we're going to use the same formula we're going to say okay if my stock and Transit is more than the mean then it's zero but if my mean minus stock quantity and Transit is uh is like if you have less than the minimum basically we're going to we're going to multiply the difference between the minimum and the St quantity and the transit and this difference we're going to multiply This Time by the sales price and that will give me okay for example for this one my minimum is 466 466 my stock is zero so basically uh I have a big risk because I didn't raise any other I don't have any Transit so my risk will be 466 times the sales price let's ver let's verify this now will be four equal 466 times the sales price because and you see 16,000 this is the risk if you want to do it perfect you could remove the safety safety the one day safety lead time we're talking about having one day safety lead time if you want to do it perfect but I feel like you also need safety Le time because your your supply is not relable so I will keep it just to to to have it simple and if you have a safety Le time you could have also a delay in your transport okay so we do have now this uh I'm going to remove this colum we do have this information and it's very interesting if you if you don't have for example enough money to to to pay all your suppliers or if you really want you don't have time just to do it because you are overwhelmed and you have too many too many things to do you just focus on okay what are my main out of stock risk you could go by value of the order you could go by okay what are the main the main impact for the business and you you will see that this is this is critical to go fast so that's the first step is to identify okay what is the value of my um oos risk and now we're going to build this dashboard o this dashboard to have a full picture per supplier what we're going to do so we already have a part of it what do we want we want the stock quantity availability stock turn we want 100 other quantities value and this so let's go back to Pivot pivot F list I'm going to remove the family so we have aity sales stock discontinue we don't have stock turn I'm going stock turn [Music] great right then then we want to have the sum of orders order quantity order value urgent order or and the risk cool so now we have a lot of percentage we don't want percentage we want quantity for that for that and that you can hold control key to do it in one shot voila and then you can remove just just select the row contrl H or you can do contrl F or contrl H and you're going to replace Su of su of by by just a blank you need to add a blank otherwise it won't work up so you see now it's cleaner and you can also remove this one manually you just need to leave it blank cool right so we know now we do have this contined we don't need this in value so we have avability stock turn we have all of these we have the Urgent order quantities urgent orders order stock risk that's amazing I'm very happy we have everything and then if you want you can add some um colors like this so let's say okay I want to have you select this you go to conditional formatting and you do uh this one this one is the opposite the bigger is the worst so you're going to go like this like this you can change the color of your perfect same for this T and same for autof stock risk you can see that we have a big risk on the Brand number now for this one we can un select I just want to have this shook so we have a big priority on Brand number number three it's also the biggest value we we have to raise we have to order and we also have more agent order quantities so this is very important and this is also one of the worst cretion in terms of avability and you have also Le your the lower to so if I have not like usually you have a process per supplier but I will focus first on Brand number three uh to make sure that we we don't lose this 15 $51,000 because of because we don't have stock today okay so that's the first step the next step is okay but I want to optimize my transport if you go back to the lead time you can see that we have three minimum order value if we order more more than for example $12,000 for brand one 50 for brand two and 80 for bron three we don't pay any transport which which can be very good because for example for Bron 3 you would pay $10,000 or for number two you would pay five $5,000 so what we're going to do now it's very simple we're going to go back to the pivot we're going to just V look up V lookup my brand with this six great so we do have this uh value we don't need this you can also if you want to keep it clean you can just use this and do like this up uh minimum order right now we have the minimum order and most of the time you want to optimize this so what we're going to do now we're going to uh we're going to check okay what is the total order quantities if we only do the Urgent one the Urgent one keep in mind this is only when the stock is equal or below than minimum so that will be technically the one that you will only raise if you really want to optimize your your inventory level without having too much stock okay but the problem is you have 48,000 uh you have $48,000 and you're going to pay uh you're going to pay because you need need to reach minimum $50,000 so you have two options or you want to keep it very simple and you just raise all these orders or the other options will be that no you're going to pick only one or two items that cost maybe $2,000 in orders to reach this 50,000 of minimum of order so you have two option if you want to keep it simple I will keep it simple in this case because it's a very shortly time anyway so I will go to my base what is the this is Brand number two yeah so we go to my base we go to Brun two and I will rise basically this is the total and this is total of all my you can just say okay I'm going to take this one plus maybe you could take this item plus this one and now I have 50,000 you see so you can do uh you can do this manually and say like okay which item represent more than 2,000 and you just raise it or if you really want to keep it simple you say no I want I want to to protect my my my service just in case we sell a bit more so what we're going to do we're going to just take all these orders we're going to take all these orders we're going to pay more but at least we will be safe for the next few days and I don't have to raise another order tomorrow morning okay so it's quite simple when you have all the tools you have the visibility I created this uh this dashboard for you you can also review the parameters to say okay let's say that you don't have for example for this one for Brand number two Brand number number one you don't have enough urgent order you say ah I don't have enough urgent order I need to to go to $112,000 and I really don't want to pay for it that's your calculation if you feel that this is way too expensive you you could increase the quantity to order or you could say no I'm going to pay my my my my fee and my fee for this one is $2,000 that's your call but what you can do as well instead of changing manually your your ERS say okay I really want to reach $112,000 of orders value what you can do you can also Force let's go back to my dashboard sorry I'm moving a bit my screen you say no I really want to oh no we already have 12,000 we already have 12,000 orders 9,000 or this one 12,000 so we already reached the minimum but let's say we don't reach the minimum let's say that the minimum now is 13,000 okay you say ah I I need a bit more or 15,000 what you can do instead of pushing more products manually you can increase one parameter to raise to increase just a little bit all the need of all your products and for that you just go to lead time and you say Okay Brand number one now we go to 0.5 safety lead time okay so we're going to we're going to add an extra 0.5 just to force the quantity then we go back to the dashboard we're going to refresh yes I know you see boom we went to 15,000 um 15,000 in order value the good thing with that is you are not going to to give too much talk to one produ that you don't really need you're going to increase just a little bit all your products now you reach $15,000 you can raise the order you can save $2,000 and don't forget at the end to go back to zero uh to make sure you don't always have this safety if you don't need the safety so you see that's a very very flexible tool and at the end my conclusion of this is when you have this visibility regarding the how often when do you have to order is basically you will run this file every day and you will see every day okay do how much stocks do I need to order is it like $5,000 or is it $100,000 and you will find your pce step by step by by playing with this file and at one point you will defend okay the best for me after using this file for for the last two or three months is to raise maybe orders twice a week or three times a week and I just asked to my team to just refresh this file quickly to see if there is not nothing urgent in case we have like we have massive um urgent orders to raise immediately okay so that's it for the how to use the file it's very flexible and then if you really like it you can also adapt this file into an Erp system uh to make it more even more automatic but you can work with this file for many years without having any it development to do
in this video we're going to create this dashboard so it's always cool to have a dashboard right to to have a clear visibility it's not mandatory you can only work with this base it will be enough to to deal with all your your orders your priority you can also analyze this file pry quickly by selecting A and B and C code and check on avability stock turn orders etc etc but I do feel like it's it's it's good and it's cool to have something nice to show to show to your direction and also it's a good way to have um to really have the the global vision okay what are the situation of my of my business in terms of inventory so I'm going to explain it's going to be a long video because I'm going to show you multiple tricks if you already follow SM metrics for example on my Excel Excel course you don't have you don't have to follow step by step you can accelerate this video or go to the end because um my goal is to really improve your inventory management skills and but this is a bonus for you if you also want to have something with a cool design okay so let's do it if you want to do it with me what we're going to do now we're going to create this graph first of all the principle to have a cool dashboard is to have all the data into one spot into one database okay so this is the base we have only one base so it's much easier we're going to use its all base on pivot table so pivot table we have this tab that we already created it's it's a bit we have a lot because because we don't need all of this I just duplicate this one let's say that we want the first one no first of all the title so for the title you see I can use I add a formula equal dashboard and week and then there is a formula to get what is the the latest week just to keep in mind the latest week is coming from sales pivot pivot I have a problem with pivot if you go to sales pivot you have the latest week so I just use the formula equal right right right right and this is the latest week because I sort I sort this data to have the latest on the left and you want the last two character cool so we have the week 41 and then you can say okay you can add some text you need to protect the text with this weak and concatenate you want space boom week 41 easy so you do the same you can also insert icon if you want from this is from this one icon for example you want to have let's say you want to have a shot like a fancy shot like this [Music] one insert you have this shart you can change the color to white you can also like if you want I forgot to say that I already I'm going to create a new one I recommend to reduce the size of this to have more more playground you can then view remove the Glide line you can also F the oh sorry you can also change the the layout to have something with a specific color I like this then I go back to dashboard okay so now let's do this avability avability avability we go back to I'm going to remove this you're going back to Pivot and for the donut if you want a donut I love donuts that's sometimes too sweet but I like sweet sometimes and for the donut there is no graph for you can use it through directly a pivot table you need to create a link so I just did that equal to the total and then I just did one minus this one then you you select this data you go to insert and you create a donut right and these Donuts we going to go this way you can just double click let's put it [Music] blue then you can change the donut size I'm going fast but it's just I like the donuts for example like this then you can the the secret is you need to hide this one into no fill oh it's always tricky to select this one cool no F uh you can remove the label you can fill this one with make sure solid F pattern fi yes so this kind of pattern you can call it avability [Music] availability and then you need to add the the percentage this value for this value you need to insert uh where is that text okay okay okay shape and then you go it's simple you go to the formula bar you go equal and you go back to the pivot to 88 great we are getting closer no F no line okay you have your ders well done easy then you can move it uh for this one discontin stock um we go to discontin stock great we're going to take this insert then you can do it directly from the pivot chart we want this one and that's it we remove the we add this button and then you can change the color it's not a big deal okay you can also move like this change the label if you want thata label and that's it okay not a big deal it's not the first time follow mymetric course if want to have a lot of example stock turn I'm going to go faster now stock turn insert pivate chart colon boom easy you always add this remove F button and you can change the layout to this for example easy then brand a brand avability brand avability we go back to this we select this one insert same so for this one I'm going to show you something cool you can go here and you can for example you say oh I've done this one before you can contrl + C you select this one and you go for this paste and boom you will copy automatically the same uh the same layout that's pretty cool right I think I picked the the wrong one that was the stock turn you want the avability so the avability was this one insert pivot chart pivot chart go back to this so you can yeah I will do it again quickly you can contrl C right click boom you don't have to do it again you can also save it you say you go to save save as a template you can save it and then you can say Okay I want the template so when you change the CH shart you go to template and you can say oh I want this one oh I want this one and boom you have it so it's much faster you can do it for this one this one is almost the same and we go to this one stock turn insert and we have this one and then you can change the charge type template boom easy all right so we have all of this I recommend you to do this one try to do this one as an ex as an exercise so make pause this video and try to do it exactly the same it's not a big you just need to change the shape format I just had this kind of goals I feel it's quite cool to have this kind of goals so for that you just insert the line just do like this and you change the color and you change the and the size okay and it's it's pretty cool if you want to to visualize okay what is your goal in the next module I will have something I will also add some sell with the goal and the targets so we have all of this perfect then for the top 10 Stock I recommend you to pause this video and to try to create this this time I'm do it with you so you pause and we do it okay cool good job I'm very proud of you we can start from this one for example let's copy so what do we need we need brand stature ABC no I think that's a big one I'm going to start from this going clean this so we need the item code no we just need the item number great we don't need the brand we want to switch to tabular form no total of we want to have the S statue ABC ABC then we want to have stock stock quantity min max stock stuck St quantity me Max mean Max for we quantity for we cells for quantity you can set up four here sales and the avability and the stock turn oops see we're good stock [Music] turn AV ability and discontin stock okay so we have this tab great good job very Pro view you can remove the sem of contrl H replace sem of then I only want to have the top 10 so what is important I want to have the top 10 Stock I just want to have my biggest stock it's very important to already see what is my biggest stock so what I'm going to do I'm going to go back to my Pivot and there is first of all you want to filter more you want to sort as descending stock in value right and then you only want to have the the top 10 and the top 10 I've done that multiple times if you follow my other course you go to Value filter and you go to top 10 you can also change you can have top 50 top 20 but I'm going to keep top 10 in stock you can change here if you want the top 10 in sales or whatever you just press okay and now we only have the top 10 beautiful I'm very excited when I create dashboards and this is this ISD and this is quantity and VOA and now we have this we can also add some conditional formatting if you want to have more like this you could also have this one is discontinued so you have an error you can also what was that pivot table options if you have an error you can you can change the display now instead of having this div you just right click oops sorry for an error you can show slash CH now we have this so Al also something very important when you right click on pivot table options I always recommend to stop autoit because otherwise the colum will always move and your dasboard is going to be super messy so you unselect this one and then when you refresh it won't it won't move again okay I mean it it's moving because of this one I think you have you have many you need to unselect all of them so you need also to do for this one etc etc okay so you have this you have the top 10 you can also do it for Stockon it's it's good to have a in a glance what is the situation and what is the Stockton as well this Stockton are really bad uh this is the wrong I would like to do the opposite J yes and you can also change I'm going to do it now you can change to say okay but I don't want to have the percentage that mean like it's 50% you will take okay the maximum is 4,000 so it's going to be range if it's at 2,000 you don't want this you want it's better to have a number so you say okay if it's more than 100 it's this way right I apply and now you see it's you have a better it's almost the same to be honest man rules number I Val low value yeah you can also have a number 300s let's see how it looks boom much better right uh so we the stock time we have this I recommend you I won't do the top 10 sales because it's almost the same you just copy and paste and you change the filter to basically here your top 10 to sales four week sales so in a glance you can see what is your top 10 in stock in sales it's you will always see a problems in this way like in this case for example I really need I really need to take care of this products especially the first one because it's discontinued and for the second one uh my top seller is out of stock so there is uh I I could even check if there is any Transit coming you could also add this at the end there is no Transit coming uh so you you need to take actions right the superly report we've done that before in the previous video so you just have to copy and paste I always recommend to do it in another Tab and then to copy and paste at this tab and the last one is just just the order item report I didn't change much it's just a pivot table with all my orders so if you go to this one I think there is a value there is a value filter to have at least orders greater than I think others other quantity greater than zero I think so yeah so we have this filter to only display what you have to order and if you don't have time you just you just have this dashboard and you just copy and paste and you or you send to your suppliers directly it's pretty efficient you can also do it with this tab Okay so we've done all of this you see it's not that complex the last thing we can do is to insert this segment so how to insert this segment you need to select one of the graph not you need to set one graph designed by by the by your pivot table so you can't select the doners because the Don is you know if you remember we did a specific link so you can select whatever graph you're using for example you can use the um the Stockon one you click on inser slicer and you will say Okay I want to have my brand segment or and family segments so you have these two great and then you can so if you click on this one it will only change specific it won't change all of them so what you have to do next you need to go to report connection and you need to select select all the pivot table you want to so you see all the the pivot you can select all the one you want to change when you select brand it will only give you access to the one from the same base so if you have another base base two it won't be able to connect unless you're using powerquery but that's another level of Excel and I won't do it today so I wanton I would this I want I don't want to do it for ABC analysis because I don't want to change that then you press okay and now everything is changing woohoo so that's it for the the segments so you can do it for brand one brand you can also do it for ABC and then you can in a glance see quickly what is your situation and how to take fast decision so that was a bit fast if you follow me till the end and thank you I'm used to do a lot of dashboard if you if you love the dashboard and if you have if you want to have this wow effect I recommend you to follow my full course ESS metrics I've done a lot for multiple Industries
last but not least how to update this file if you want to use this file I told you every day or every week you want to do it as fast as possible you really want to focus on the quality of of your analysis and to for decision making and action and for that it's it's quite simple because I'm using a very standard format you just have so you have three uh options or you have four options the first one you see you just have to extract the data and copy and paste and replace so you can replace the sales it's quite simple you get from your software you just save as you just copy and paste okay that's the first option you have nothing like this one can be change manually but not every day same for the load size unless you have item missing I recommend to double check if that you don't have any item missing we're going to do that in the expert level but yeah you most you need to the most important is to update the sales at least once a week the stock and the transit and this one I guess you have to do it maybe once a month so it's not big process the second option is you record a macro or will copy and paste automatically that's the second option I'm not going to explain that today but I have an Excel course if you want to learn how to do it and the third option is to use power query so power query for me is much more easy and it's much easier and efficient for example in the expert stock and I'm going to create also a bonus for the pro level to explain to you how to use it just the introduction but enough to refresh the file in this file for example you can see that I create a link with all my folders if we go to expert data expert this is all the file I'm using and I'm not they're not not even in my file there is just a link and to update I just have to create to refresh the link or I can refresh all and that by refreshing all it will update my file automatically for all my information and I don't even need to have my sales in my Excel file so that's the third option the last option is to leave Excel and to use this as a specification and to say okay guys I love Excel but I want to have it in the software so when I do Consulting usually we start with this Excel we play with this Excel with the team for few months to make sure we have everything right and correct and then everything is ready and the team like it if they if we have the budget and if we have for example a lot of information to to take manually to take manually we can uh use this as a specification to to use an IT development but to be honest if you use for example power query you can use this file for many years and that will be that will be enough and you don't have to spend thousand of Euros um to develop something in with it it's up to you it depends if you're a consultant if you're a manager or if you want to keep it simple okay so you just have to do that and then so to refresh the only thing you have to do is to copy and paste do automatically or manually then you go to data and you just click on refresh all so we will refresh automatically make sure that you have also the calculation is automatic or if it's manual just press F9 or just save this file you can save this file and sometimes just to make sure if you don't see anything moving you just take one uh pivot table and you just press refresh to make sure that everything is up to date but usually you don't have to do that okay so at the end you have your your F ready you can just directly go okay why is the the global situation right now you can also save your result for example if you don't have any avability history you could start saving this avability rate every week to have a to have to see the evolution every week for for example for the one avability discontin stock and stock ton that will be good good to see this Evolution and then you can see quickly okay what is my situation of ABC code always start with from macro to micro first of all the global situation of your of your business then the a cut then the B cut and the way to do it is always okay what is my for example avability I will start with my acot I we okay this is okay I have this four products do I have any orders to to raise for this yes I do have orders to raise then I we I will go back to the the B Cod say okay oh I have more more products to to take care out of stock and then I will go to the sec5 time or you can also do another way is to just focus on what are the main all of stock risk and you focus on that if your priority is the service always balance between risk of service and risk of Overstock for the Overstock you do the opposite way I always do that with my team it's it's so efficient because it's so easy when you have the full visibility you say okay this is my biggest stock and then I say okay I want to see first of all greater than 300 I take care of this I have Antion plan to see what I can do in terms of promotion we're going to do that in the expert level and you can say okay now I I took care of this one so I'm going to go back to more than 200 etc etc all right so that's the way I'm working we're going to see much more example in the professional and expert level but that was for me the foundation to start working whatever you're using a simple minmax or dynamic minmax maybe it was already too much for you but at least you can see the full picture while the foundation to start um working and optimizing your inventory and I'm going to show you much more in the next ones if it's already too complex Stay With Me the idea is really to get the most the an overview what is possible you're going to start maybe with this file for a few weeks few months and then the for the next one for the when you you feel ready for that you can go to the next level I see you for another video
congratulation we you pass Foundation level now let's go to the pro you want to become a pro that's that's the way we're going to go even deeper with the number of parameters and stay by step you will become a professional than an expert so stay with me we're going to go step by step and it's very important that you follow the first step because most of the steps the foundation I'm using a lot of foundation even if this is not the same formula we use a lot of similar parameters dashboards and kPa all right so now we are ready for more more complexity and uncertainty it's it's quite useful if you have for example very long lead time like three 1 two 3 four five 6 months the more you have lead time I was explaining that before the more you the longer is your L time the more you need to face against this uncertainty and the more you need to have a strategy a very specific strategy per product and per supplier okay so we're going to go even deeper we're going to talk about economic order quantity we're going to do a lot of a BC XYZ analysis we're going to talk about how to classify your suppliers and your products and at the end we will have a dynamic Safety stock with EQ to manage automatically your stock just as a reminder I've done I've done that before but the minmax is quite simple it's really easy to implement and we done that in the the previous module it's a good way to start if you want really want to keep it simple you just have the average sales maybe use the the seasonality the lead time and the the safety lead time and you can use the saice target ratio ABC that's the level Foundation now we're going to the next level and for the next level this time we're going to use what we call the economic order quantity plus Safety stock we're going to combine these two and we're going to go step by step first with economic order quality then with the Safety stock and recalculate the re point to trigger The Order each time we reach this level all right so once again just to remind you the minmax is simpler efficient it's a good start it's easy to implement but it won't take into consideration the demand and supply and certainty of course on the other side it's more accurate you will have a more total cost approach because we're going to also consider the inventory and holding cost and transaction cost as well we will also consider the super uncertainty it's also more complex and I recommend this for longly time ey volumes and you can also combine that with the forecast so I'm going to go stay by stay with another example I'm going to show you what is the Excel so that was the foundation level with the ABC and the minmax we we've done just before now we're going to the Pro the pro is very similar we use the same range of products we're going to use the same pricing but this time we have much more information for suppliers right we have suppliers we have lead time we also have let me show that we have the country we we don't need this one because it's the same we have you see the lead time is much longer so we have a longer review period as well we do have a safety lead time we also have the supplier and certainty so I'm going to explain to you how to classify automatically your suppliers we have this new category called XY Z and then we're going to use the same like average sales we we won't change this we use we we use sorry the same type for that we use the same kpi as well but then we're going to start implementing new parameters with EQ econom all quantity and we'll have a new formula for the safety stock and at the end I'm going to also compare with the the current minmax just to compare just to give you what of the main difference and we will also consider like the out of stock risk the orders and the agent orders as well all right so I hope you're excited we going to go stay by step we'll have a very very similar dashboard but this time we have much more suppliers we have something like 20 suppliers and we will create these dashboards together we will have all so the XY Z analysis we're going to go step by step with that and we'll have more information regarding the suppliers how to classify them with different pivot table etc etc so please don't know this file below the video and then we're going to start slowly step by step but it's very important if you I'm going to go super fast I'm not going back to sales or Price or stock because we're using the same data but this time we have longer late time more suppliers and also more information regarding the economic order quality so I see you for the next video
in this episode we're g and not only this one but the next one because I'm going to get more into details we're going to talk about the ABC XY Z analysis I know you have expectation regarding that and we I'm going to explain to you why ABC analysis is not good enough what are the solutions to to to go deeper and I'm going to give you also a lot of examples and different methods to do it so why this is not enough let's go to in the the pro professional file let's go to XY Z simple why this is not enough it's because let's take these two items item one and two they have the same level of sales or demand you see like 3,400 quantities but one is very stable the item one and the item two is moving from 100 to 600 so you you don't need like if you only apply what we we learned in the in the previous module okay I want to have more safety on a code and less on C code you you won't optimize your inventory because it one is very predictable is selling from what is the mean and the max the mean is the minimum is you can check here average the minimum and the maximum so the minimum is 260 the the maximum is 304 when this one I was saying before oops this one the minimum is 80 the maximum is 600 so you don't need you won need the same safety this the second one is very unpredict predictable so if you go back to the this uh graph we need to move from three categories to more to a better level of details to improve the performance that's why we're moving now to nine categories and I will explain later if you can go if you want to go further okay what is important so first of all you need an ABC analysis I won't I won't I'm not going to repeat this ABC analysis I've done one just before in the previous model in this tab I'm using the same level of data this is the I'm using the last 26 um last 26 week sales you can also combine with the forast I'm going to do that in the next module but I'm not going to repeat that it's just based on sales okay so if I go back to my presentation first of all you need an ABC analysis but the problem with the the ABC analysis you have two common mistakes the first one is oh I'm going to put High stock coverage because it's a top seller or I'm going to put the low stock coverage because this article a code is very very predictable and sometimes sometimes correct sometimes not correct this is the example we could just see just before in Excel then you you you could have the same the same common mistake for low for the the C codes low stock coverage because they're not very important I stock coverage because they're not predictable you sell one then zero for two weeks then three then zero etc etc okay so that's why we're moving to nine categories because of that and we need to classify the the products regarding the level of uncertainty when we say uncertainty it's about the demand not the sales be careful with that sometimes we don't have the information the difference between sales and demand but if you have it it's always better to use the demand so we have very predictable products like the toilet paper when you don't have a pandemic like covid most of the time they are quite predictable I've been working with multiple retail company supermarket and the sales are very very stable if you don't have a pandemic the it's the same for the French baguette we do eat baguette every single day so it's quite predictable we have more fancy cant and and cakes for for the weekend but the baguette the one year baguette is very predictable yes it's one year only in France I mean it was then we have the products less predictable and you have products very unpredictable for example umbrella you don't know when it's going to rain so you can have you can have a time times like in terms of demon you can have a big variation and it's not easy to predict unless you have very good weather forecast okay so it's very important to understand that even if you have the same volume you have different categories that's why we're going to use we're going to combine the ABC with I volume to slow volume with the level of uncertainty IE volume stable I volume fluctuating and ie volume very fluctuating okay so we're going to we're going to cross these two and we will have nine categories from high volume to stable to low volume to very fluctuating and based on this we can have different Inventory management policy I'm going to get back to this you have two main inventory management policy you can have one really focus on okay if this is not predictable I want more safety so I want to make sure I want to improve my service the risk regarding this approach is you're going to you're going to have much more stock on on these products and if they're not profitable you also have a risk to Overstock your your your level of stock so you have to be careful I will never take a lot of risk for my low sales very unpredictable whatever in my strategy because this ones most of the times it's because that they have very very low sales but for the top sellers and the beers you could have a different approach and if you focus on service then you can apply what we call the service rate target I'm going to get back to this after with different service rate targets or you could have an inventory management policy really focus on cash flow or profit you could also do your ABC analysis not based on um on Revenue in value but in in Prof in profit or profit margin and you could say okay I will only focus my safety on the most predictable one for example if you have if you have a war a pandemic you are really in a crisis situation I will not take any risk on an unpredictable product because I don't want to have any over stock so we'll do the opposite we'll put more safety St on this products and less on this one and even zero on the one with uh low sales and a big level of uncertainty I'm going to give you more example just after with how to define these parameters and optimize that okay so now that was the introduction in the next episode we're going to I'm going to talk about how to calculate in Excel in first of all in a very simple example then in the big base that we have
so in this episode we're going to start calculating the XY Z classification I'm going to give you a simple method that you can use today immediately and in the next video I'm going to give you also more examples with the limit of this method and what are the other solution so let's start with the simple XY Z simple example what we're going to do we're going to use what we call the standard deviation what is the standard deviation let's just do this formula again St Dev you select this and you have this 40 14.7 and this 174 what is this value this value I will try to keep it simple is let's say like your average is your average is oop 283 for this one like the a like the standard deviation is what is the average deviation versus your 283 okay so the the biggest is your standard deviation the biggest will be the deviation versus your average so basically you can see that for the for the green one for ATM one your standard deviation is only 14 one the other one is 174 when the the average of this one is 290 which is a lot okay so you have you have the standard deviation for every product the problem is these products are not very comparable because you can have a big variation but you can have also very very small values for example this one you say oh I have 2.9 I only have 2.9 um deviation but this is because also the average is very low the average of this one is six when the average of this one is 290 so it's important that the standard deviation is not enough you need to it's like the seasonality before we were using where I don't know if you remember the base 100 where is the seasonality here we go you can't really compare you if you only use the value you will have one brand with $1 million one BR with $10 million so you can't really compare all this um all of this that's why we were dividing by the average to have what we call a base 100 and we will do the same with the XY z um XYZ classification so what we're going to do now we're going to just divide this standard deviation by the average of the period that you selected okay so in this case one year one per month okay great so now we have a coefficient of variation and in this case we cannot really compare in this one we can compare all the items that are moving basically from zero to to maybe 200 300 maximum but that you can really compare them then the next step is to Define okay what is what is X what is y what is z that's a very good question you have multiple way to do to do it there is no Golden Rule for that in this specific example I just say like if my value is less than 10% than x if it's less than 25 than y otherwise Z okay so that's one rule the IDE is you you want basically to have approximately the same distribution than ABC you want to have 5 to 10% of X you want to have um 20% of Y and you want to have the rest with with zed I'm going to give you more example there is no golden R this is one of the limit of this classification but this is also a good way to start the idea is really to identify what are the the one with a lot of variation or not and that's one of the main question I have is okay but what is how do you define the the X the Y and the Z that's why that was a very simple example you can do it again if you want now let's do it in a bigger base so let's do it with this one so it's already done to do that so we're going to use the P sales and then in the next me I'm going to tell you why what are the limits and why what are the other options for that what I've done I've done just I'm going to copy and paste that so I've done this pivot table in the in the previous module it's just a pivot table with all my um my sales for the last 52 weeks so I recommend you to have always the one the most recent one on the left so I did by sorting Z to A if you do this way and you have for example 53 weeks or 44 54 you you won't get it won't be easy to get always the last 52 weeks for example okay so we have we have this codes perfect and what we're going to do we're going to do the same we're going to insert two colum so if you take from the previous file I just insert one more colon and I say okay I want the standard deviation St Dev St there off and you select the period okay if you have more than 52 weeks you can just do 52 weeks so it's important that you get this horizontal format so you could do directly the standard deviation in the in the pivot table but I like to see what is visible and sometimes you don't it's good to see the value to analyze okay so we do have the standard deviation for every single item then we do the same formula we're going to divide the average of the same period by the standard deviation and we have a coefficient of variation I do it for 52 weeks I recommend to have the more what is important for the standard deviation is more or many period you have so if you work in months I will not do it for three months because the standard deviation for three months doesn't you only have three three data set three data point of data it won't be very relevant so if you have it per week um you can you could use at least six months it really depends also on the seasonality of your products once again don't don't look for Perfection take something that is relevant for your business if you have a lot of variation in your products and you have a lot of seasonality you could use a shorter period but I feel like the longest is the better unless you don't have any sales history okay so that's it for the the standard deviation and the percentage of varation and then we do have a formula and this formula will give you okay but what is my repetition so we use the formula called if if my value is less than B2 and B2 is this this time 30% then I put X if otherwise if less than 50% then A3 otherwise I will I will put blank I I will have equal equal and that's it okay so you can just repeat this formula can copy and paste it's not that complex I would just say like if there is nothing at the end because I extended my formulas because I want to have more if I have more information I don't want to copy and paste then I just put blank because I don't want to have I don't want to have Z so you have this I'm going to go back to the coefficient after then you have the number of item for the number of item you're going to just use the formula count if what is the range is this one and what is the criteria is this one that's it so you can see the number of item you can see the the percentage just divide the number of items of x divided by the total okay so you can see that in this Cas we have 7% of X code we have 19% of Y and we have 74% of Z so the question regarding okay but what is what is the right coefficient of variation what is the the the right balance between XY Z what is the limit and this is not there is not this is not the rocket science the the perfect one and we go back to the perfect world you should have a you could have you you could even directly use this coefficient of valuation in your inventory management policy and you you could not you don't even have to classify XY Z that's the perfect policy you could also use machine learning it could be much more more complex than that the problem with that is you're going to get many people lost and you use this tool not only for for inventory management but it's also an edication tool to also take strategic decision for example during your SNP process so I like to keep it very simple especially if you never tried XY Z classification before and I like to to get something close to the ABC and ABC repetition 540 2080 and the rest okay so I like to play because it doesn't make sense if you say no I want to have for example less than 5% variation you don't have any so it doesn't make sense for me to have any um it doesn't make sense for me to have any item X just because de okay you remember in the previous example we say oh my minimum was 10% and this in this case in 10% I have zero item I have zero item with less than 10% valuation so you have to you need to have a policy that include at least a few products if I do to 20% I only have seven items which is like not much if I go to 30 I have oh now I have 7% of the item which is I feel a good number you could go to maybe 25% and now we have 3% so let's go to 30% you could go to 29% but I like to have run numbers as well I'm like this uh you could go to 28 and say okay for 28 I have 5% but I like run run numbers and I go I go to 30 and I did the same for the Y I could go to maybe 45 13% yeah you could also do that or 50 and then I just have a formula this is an automatic formula that will automatically do the same so keep it simple you you should play with this number and you should just simulate and see okay what is the repetition and after that if you really want for example if if you have a big Focus to reduce your inventory and your focus is mainly on z and y Cod and you feel that you need you need to reduce more inventory then you can play with this limit and say no I want to have more Z products so you can reduce that you will increase this number okay so not a big deal start simple play with this number and by experience you will feel okay I need to adjust yes or no so that's the first example now we have an XY Z analysis perfect beautiful and now if you go back to the base we just V up base we just V up here the item code and we have XY Z analysis automatically which is amazing you can do it automatically or you can do it in a separate file and the defined to do it maybe only one per quarter when for example if you have a lot of new products you could also do it manually and change for example few products if you don't have enough data I we go back to this maybe you have also new products and you don't have enough data you can also Define manually specific items if they only have maybe two or three three weeks of sales or if there are new products you don't know yet what's going to happen to them but I'm going to talk about also the limits of this methodology in the next video but I hope this is good enough to start I've been working with big Corporation and this is already a very good start and then we're going to get deeper
in this video I'm going to talk about the limit of this first method with the standard deviation this this is a good way to St but this is not perfect nothing is perfect so I'm going to tell you what to be careful with and also another method if you want to avoid this these problems the first one you have to be careful to have enough I was saying that before enough or we call data point if you only have 10 uh like five five weeks or five months you won't have enough data to really see if you have enough data another point which is very very very important you will have products for example this one you see that you don't have you have blank you have blank and it's it's a big difference between blank and zero I'm going to copy and paste that and explain to you that was I got this question multiple maybe 50 times from my members so I'm going to copy that many consultant ask me this question as well I'm going to copy that you could do the same boom okay so we do have this data set and what I'm going to do you can always let's make it a table insert table yes cool very excited so now let's do the standard deviation and you will see that let's say like I'm going to give you two example oh sorry I'm going to copy this two they the same right but this one I'm going to put zero zero boom okay so we're going to focus on these two these two and now let's calculate the standard deviation St Dev great so we have a standard deviation of 11 10.9 and this one we have a standard deviation of 9.3 so we don't have the same value why because this one we will consider like this one is blank so when you do the standard deviation you won't have an impact if you if you select the full year or only this you'll have the same value but in this one because you have zero you will lower the average and you will also you will change the results so let's do it with the average equal this divided by the average I like to Mi noise when I do excel I'm sure you know that cool [Music] uh so you see you have a huge difference in terms of you don't have massive difference in terms of standard deviation but in terms of um percentage of variation you have 50% and the other one is 249 why because in one case we consider we are not selling so it's blank and in the other case you have zero so it means you the product was for sale but you didn't sell you could be also consumption for factory we have the same principle so it's very important when you get this data that you have make sure that okay what does it mean when it's blank and what does it mean when it's zero what should what should be the perfect data it should be like if this product start selling or consuming like for your factory in this week it should be blank before not zero if it's zero the Devi the standard deviation will be wrong and your average as well will be wrong if I do the average of this let's keep it I'm going to do the average average and this is STD dep I'm going to copy this into this because I'm lazy average so you have average for the first one of 21.7 and the other one is 3.8 why because we have so many zero so be very careful with that and I know I was talking with a lot of Consultants sometimes you only have zero and you need to clean manually and you need to get the starting date and sometime yeah you need to clean you need oh no I need for example for this one no that was always 00 Z what I should do is I'm going to go down let me give it's a bit manual but I I feel this is very important and you will understand me when you'll face this uh this problem come on buddy okay whatever so for example if I get this example so this item as a coefficient of valtion 142 but I do feel like if you only have 00 0 I will clean this sub o suppress I know my coefficient is 35 so it's very important to have this right information if you don't have this at least I would check maybe your top sellers first the one that you really want to focus on so because if they they they just started like few weeks ago you should have some problem so you have two options or you do it manually or you do it automatically you have a starting date and the ending date or you can what you can you you can do it manually like cleaning visually like this you can for example you could have a special to help you you could add conditional formatting for zero you let's create a new one it's it's manual but you have to do it once in the past and then if possible you create a condition in your in your software to make sure it doesn't happen again okay apply boom so now you can see in the better way if it's for example this one is you should not clean this one because you have one sometime but when you have a long long one with zero maybe for example this one I will I will clean this one look at yeah like this one definitely is not accurate in the database so we have a coefficient version of 259 I will clean I know we have a coefficient of of 52 okay so that's one of the challenge we have with the quality of the data but to be honest even if it's not perfect it's better than nothing why because for example if you only have three or four story and oh you still have z0 whatever when you start selling a new product you have much more uncertainty most of the K because you don't have any um you don't have any sales history so even if you don't clean the data it's better than nothing because it's always good at the beginning to have more uncertainty because you don't really know what's going to happen and you can adjust manually you can Al also Force manually to say no no no no there is this product for example this one this one is an xcode because I know I know I know it and it's quite stable okay well it's not the case really but just to give you an example so you don't have you can do it fully automatic that's a good way to start then you can have a look to say okay is it relevant for all my itms maybe for this group of items I can correct manually and but you just go stay by step go get 40% of the performance then 60 then 80 and if you start overthinking you won't do anything it will be much better whatever whatever you're doing today will be much better probably than what you were doing before okay so that's that's that's the first um thing you have to be very careful and in my next video I'm going to give you another method to uh to get to avoid this kind of problem and I will be in the next video
let's talk about XY Z again but this this time I'm going to give you another method why because the first method is not perfect why is not perfect this is the item one and item two I like to I like to joke with myself right it's okay okay it's okay great so we have item one and item two education should be fun right my teacher was so serious they were never smiling never playing I mean most of them but I try to be different okay let's go so what is the the limit with method one um for example you have this item one and item two and one is very like fluctuating and the other one looks like there is there is a trend there is a seasonality maybe it's ice cream and we sell a lot of a lot of ice creen in July and August maybe it's something that you can really predict okay so in this case we have the same coefficient of variation because we have the same standard deviation but one it looks like the number one should be more relevant so what is the solution for that you can't clean the data right so the best solution for that is to use what we call the forast accuracy so what is the forecast accuracy the forast accuracy is the quality of your forecast we're going to use this method in the expert level just to show you in the expert level you can download this file now if you want but please stay with me because we have we still have a lot of things to see together and what is that okay you have you have one solution with XY what we call XYZ sales and another one with forast accuracy I want to explain to you in this episode how to calculate the forast accuracy I did a special article and I'm going to talk more about the forecast accuracy in the next module but just just get this information if you have Focus if you don't have Focus basically you don't have much option you need to use you need to start focusing maybe and I'm going to cover that later and you need also to um to you you have no choice that to use your what happened in the past or to use your your your experience maybe to do it manually but I don't like to do things manually I'm I'm lazy and I don't trust humans when you have too much data to to analyze okay so what I recommend to do is if you have access to the forecast accuracy you could use it as a coefficient of of variation and the better is the forecast accuracy the lower should be your your classification and for example in this specific example and I'm going to go back to this in the expert module I have the I did the same table but this time I say okay if my focus accuracy is great greater than 75% then it's X if it's greater than 55 then it's y otherwise it's Z okay so it's pretty simple if you use so you have the focus accuracy but you also have the forus deviation the deviation is the the opposite so if you have for example 80% Focus accuracy the opposite will be 1 minus uh 1 minus 80.8 oop I know it's 20% but I just wanted to show you the formula come on so this is the accuracy and this is the deviation the deviation is the error okay so you could use if you use the focus cir see use more than if it's deviation use less than and then once again you can play with this number you can say okay no I want 80 80 but if I have 80 I only have three % of the time if I go to 75% I have 7% and if I go to 50 I could use 50 as well and you can see that then we can compare what what will be the difference between uh the sales XYZ sales and XYZ with forast accuracy most of the time it's quite similar but for some products for example this one you have a very poor Focus accuracy you will switch it to to Z so it's more to be honest it's much more relevant for me to use the forecast accuracy but I can tell you that many companies they don't don't have Focus or they don't have Focus accuracy okay so that's why we're going to keep it very simple if you have it use it if not the standard deviation is a great start also the good the good thing with the focus accuracy if you calculate it properly you won't have the problem with this Blan cell with the zero I was explaining in my previous video so that's that's a good way to start you have to pick the right one and I'm going to keep talking about if if this is enough even if you are using the focus area accuracy is it good enough the the ABC XY z um method to be honest you could go to 36 categories you could go much deeper into how many categories you could also use infinite categories by basically using for example the focus accuracy level and you you could use the variation of the focus accuracy it's more complex I'm not going to cover that uh today if you have more question you can also ask me and I'm going to share with my members but you could also use for me the the absolute solution is to use to have an infinite solution for an infinite items and you will use machine learning to always optimize what is the best solution to be honest that's the the end go but most of the time when I say most of the time is 99.99999% of the company they're not ready for that and because they're not ready for that I would not recommend to start from zero to that I think this is uh the level of maturity of your not only your supp but your company you you need to go step by step and it's also very important because this is an education tool it's not only about it's not only you with your inventory it's also a very important tool to educate everyone about what is important about to find the balance between service and inventory and the ab XYZ analysis is an amazing tool people will love it it's simple to explain but it's simple if you only have nine categories if you talk about 36 categories people will get very confused and we say okay what are you talking about even ABC analis for many people not working supply chain is not that simple okay we they don't they are not like people from sales or marketing sometimes I just say sometimes they not used to play with numbers okay except for the bonus uh when they get more sales right just a private joke so okay so it's important it's an amazing education tool that you can present to during your SNP process if you have one to your marketing your sales department Finance production suppliers and also customers to really explain okay to Define together what are the key strategic products and you can also have a a manual selection for specific items that you can Define with your suppliers and customers and also with your marketing and sales for example if you when you launch a new produ you say okay this one is a very important one so let's put it manually a code and then we don't know about the market because this is a new color or this is a new component for your factory so let's define that it's a z z code because we don't have much uh much information about it so for all the process of new products you could do it manually and you could be really a different like um a global strategy and for every category for example if you have a a crisis management you have a you have a big crash of the market it's also an amazing tool to really align all the department to say okay first of all we all agree on the method of classification for the products and then what is the different what is the strategy per different products and for for example the low sales and Z codes we could just say okay for this Cod we just canel all orders we only wait for ERS from the customers to get stock in the warehouse or in the factory so keep in mind once again this is an amazing education tool this is also an amazing tool to really align all the department and if you keep it simple it's much easier to explain and to align everyone if you have much more category like I know that like I did a lot of work with data science and we we were using like many many different categories but it was but basically impossible to explain so you need to accept that if you want to work as a black box and don't explain to anyone great do it but for most of the time we are not ready for that and you will get 80% of the result by doing that and you will also align all the department your suppliers and your customer by doing that with a proper strategy
in this video we're going to talk about the lead time and the supplier uncertainty that was one of the biggest challenge we had over the last few years with unexpected event like the S Canal block the pandemic the shortage of critical component raw material the inflation the problem of transport and then at the end is not only because of the the factory I can feel you it was it was not easy before but the last few years were quite challenging it's not only because of the factory or your supplier whatever is the supplier in the world it's also because of so many events so you have an average you have an average lead time but the average lead time sometimes is just one number but you could you could have for example between China and the US from 20 days or even less if you ship by plane 2 120 even two or three years if you have a global shortage for specific components and it's very important that you understand that it's not only because of the factory of the transport you have multiple events that can really impact this lead time quality issues custom transport etc etc so it's very important in the my previous example if we go back to this example in the foundation level my lead time was quite short so it was not that important it was quite easy to track you didn't have much complexity was one to three to four four days lead time but if you are going to a very long lead time it's very important that this this information is the most important with average s if you don't do it properly if you don't have the right information in your file or in your system everything else is less important you can do the whatever is your safety stock seasonality XYZ classification if your lead time is not I'm not I don't say not I don't say you have to reduce all time this is this is a good solution before even reducing you need to have the most accurate information and that's what we're going to do right now okay so we we're going to track this lead time quality first of all average and then the level of uncertainty and we're going to classify these suppliers and consider like a different safety according to that okay and don't forget that in the lead time it's not only about the lead time but you also have the review period if you only place one order every week you need to add this extra week in your lead time then you have the it confirmation the production the picking and packing I was talking about that late later before but it's very important that you understand it the lead time is not only transport it's not only production it's a consequence and addition of multiple steps and multiple steps can um can have an impact and have a delay on your total lead time from I need the stock to I receive the I receive the qualtity okay so we're going to go back to excel again the last time we just need the manual safety lead time that was the very simple way to start you could also use this way but we're going to go much deeper right now so we go back to this file and this time we we have so if we go back to the base you can see that we have we have a lead time we have a review period and you have a supplier level of uncertainty and we're going to we're going to go step by step first of all we're going to focus on the average lead time and then how to classify in a very simple way three level of uncertainty okay cool let's do it so what do we need first we need to have orders so if you want to update your lead time I can tell you that most of the company they update their lead time in the cstem once maybe every three or four years so they will create the the supplier in the system and they will say okay this supplier on the paper is solid days so 30 days three years after no one changed this value and maybe the late time right now is 60 days but no one and because of that you can just double your inventory level just because someone forgot to actualize this information the C this is one of the most impactful one if you double your de lead time you're going to double your level of talk so you have to make sure that it's accurate before even trying to optimize by five or 10% your inventory so in this tab we have we have orders in the past we need to have the more you will have a in the past the more it will be easier to evaluate the level of service of your supplier you have the item item number you have the PO what is the PO is the purchase order you have another date you have the name of the supplier you could also have the country of your supplier you have what we call the CDD and the Ed what is CD CDD is contract is sorry contract delivery date Ed is estimated delivery date that was what was the plan at the at the beginning and what was what what happened so it could be it could be something that is happening in the future you didn't receive the stock yet which could be for example a new estimation or it could be like the the the reality if it's in the past it means that the the products already arriv the CDD should be calculated automatically when you raise a new order you'll say you the system will say okay the average is 60 days so I'm going to put my other date Plus for example 60 days and this is my CDD and the Ed is the reality it's like when did you really receive the stock okay it's very important that you really separate these two if you really want to track the quality of your lead time if you already update this one you will never really know what is the quality of your supplier okay so make sure you really have these two separately the what was in the contract and what is the reality otherwise it's good for the average lead time to have this one but it's also good to challenge the the supplier sorry I need to drink tea I'm going to drink tea but no break you can drink tea too that was the break okay I'm I'm still alive don't cut no cut for this one okay uh next so we do at then we have the quantity orders and we have the value the value is the the cost of the stock then we do have the the quantity receives and the dollar receives we can use that for the fear rate of the the supplier okay and then we do have what we call the committed leate time the committed leate time is what was what was the contract in this order 65 days and then I'm going to explain to you how to how to calculate um all this information to calculate first of all uh the average lead time and then the accuracy of your supplier okay so you need to have this kind of file if you don't have anything like this you should start tracking and then or find someone who can give you this information so the first thing we're going to do is we're going to calculate the average lead time what is the average lead time we're going to use this formula and it's oh it's a bit more we're going to start with this one actually time no cap Max and then I'm going to give you example actually time no cap Max is just a difference between the Ed and the other date so one when arrived the stock and one one was the order created okay you have the actual lead time in the system great I'm proud of you so now let's create a pivot table yes from this table six and let's analyze the suppliers raise the number we could check the number of orders we have the count and we have the Quan We want to have the the let's take this one first I'm going to explain to you what is the difference between these two and the committed lead time great so we're going to do this we're going to do average and average great great so we have the commited leate time and we have the actual lead time and you can this is the first and this is a very simple but very important step you can already see the difference between these two you can do it manually or you can let's do it with a calculated field ah no it won't work this way you can do it manually you can just do uh D4 minus C4 and this is your difference yeah that's a big difference for example Belgium one is has a huge difference 56 uh this one is minus one so this is the first step you need to have is okay what is my commited what is my contract lead time and what is basically what do you have in the system or in your contract and what is the reality and the biggest is the the Gap the more important you have to make sure that it's up to date in the system all right so the first step keep it simple you check one by one and then you you you double check okay is it relevant to for example increase China One from 95 202 or maybe there is a problem and there is a problem for example Belgium why do we have 50 like the the the average committed Le time is 18 days and we do have 74 day 7 24 days that's why we have another colon
okay so I cut this episode in two because I like to have suspense and I go back to this one so the first step was to keep it simple you have your average um lead time you can update in the system but some sometimes it's just crazy like you don't want to have Belgium with like an average lead time of 74 days which is insane right I know people from Belgium are very professional they're very accurate as as sanan hello if you are part of this course but yeah it's you need to check it's important also sometimes to check these numbers and you don't have to do it this automatically all the time so let's go back to these past orders and see okay but what happened in Belgium what happened with you guys and let's go to the supplier Belgium one there we are so we do have an actual lead time for two orders that was 383 days which is a lot okay and the problem is yeah effect effectively we have we had this order in 2020 and received the products more than one year after you have two reasons for that the first reason could be okay maybe someone forgot to scan the products at the warehouse at the factory so that could be a human error maybe there is a problem with it the the date was maybe one one year too late that's the first that's the one possible solution the other one is you have a global shortage with your supplier or the Factory close for for whatever is the reason and at the end you receive this order one year after okay so make sure you can sell the order if you don't really need that but in this specific case we have a huge impact because of one or two other you can have a massive impact for your average lead time and if you do if you do it automatically without any like safety roles you could completely explode the level of stock just because of that or you could have the opposite you could have like one orders with one one day lead time and that will crash completely and you will let shortage just because of that so it's a very important episode because you need to have some safety rules and these safety rules is called we're going to cap the maximum variation and we're going to use a very simple parameters called Max variation lead time and you can change this parameters to 50 50% 100% I'm going to use 100% so how does it work the principle of this is what is I don't want to have more variation than 100% of my uh commited lead time so if I have 18 days you see you have 18 days here I don't want to have more than the double of 18 so the double of 18 is 36 right so I don't want to have more or less if I have more than 36 Days in average I will keep 36 I don't want to have 383 and at the end my average will be much lower so in this case my average is 21 in this case my average is 74 so I will really reduce this impact you could also say no I want to have 50 50% 50% variation only and when you do that now you will have 19 and this this case it's 18 you see like Belgium like I mean suppliers 2 Belgium are very accurate it's always 18 so it's a very powerful and very simple tool why I'm using percentage why not using all plus or minus seven days because it really depends on the how many days of lead time do you have if you have for example let's say if you have five days Le time you don't want to have a variation of plus or minus seven days you don't want to have a variation of 30 days you you will say okay two or three days is the maximum I want to have if you're in China or if you have a very long link time for example this one you don't want to have like a variation of seven days you you could say okay I could go up to maybe 150 180 days okay okay that's why the the percentage if you have big variation of lead time between like short short lead time suppliers and long lead time suppliers are always recommend to use a percentage and the formula looks a bit long but it's not that complex you just have to repeat what I'm doing I will just check what is the the current actual lead time so I will just do I will Define first of all what is my maximum and my maximum will be this one so this actually time so Ed minus the other date multiply by 1 plus my percentage here you can lock with A4 Tri so now you have your max Time Boom Bravo and you can Define to 50% 100% we're going to play with that just after and then you just set an if if basically my time is more than 92 then I'm going to use 92 if it's Le if it's less I'm going to use the the actual average lead time that's it okay it's a bit fast but just check the formula and you can also have multiple columns if you feel it's too complex for you for that you could do it for the minimum you can also do it for the maximum in this case I'm just cying the maximum because most of the time you have more L time than less but you could do it in the in the in both way it's more important to understand the principle then you can do it in Excel or in your Erp system I can tell you that most of the company they put lead time manually and they don't have any safety rules like this one and the powerful the power of this rules is you can you don't have to double check manually you just put this rules you just need to adapt what is the best parameter I like 100% because I also don't want to if you have a very bad uh lead time I also want to consider this one and you you will have much more um you will have you you will cap at the maximum but you also you also want to reflect the reality of the quality of this player okay so that's it for the cap lead time and at the end if we go back to the Belgium lead time you can see that instead of having let's switch back to that if we now use the new colon actually time oops oops actually time the one we're going to use we're going to use the average of this no average my friends here we go I'm very instead of having 74 now we have 21 okay so this is the one you want to update in your database this is not the one okay for for some of them I think there is another problem with Spain as well or is Spain Spain Spain we don't have Spain yes we do have Spain this one as well I think no yeah this one was 14 and know it's nine so sometimes you have big difference sometimes you have not but it's very important to have this safety rule so I did the same here you have the number of orders you have the commited lead time the actual lead time and we're going to you're going to work on this to make sure that you update your database so this is is your database you have like you have you need to have a specific base it could be in Excel or incm I like to have it in Excel as well but make sure you have the same value you have your supplyer your country you could have a minimum order value we're going to go back to this you have the review period is the same for each supplier it means that we're going to order once a week for the for every supplier and then you do have the committed lead time and for example for Belgium where is [Music] Belgium Belgium one the committed lead time is 18 and this is your decision to say okay based on my Pivot my actual lead time with Belgium is Belgium one where is Belgium one sorry it's been a long day my actually time is 21 so that's your decision you say you can analyze or you can say okay there is was just one one problem with that sometimes you just apply the formula sometime you will say no you know what for Belgium I was checking it's just one issue one time and it's not because of the supplier it's because of us so we're going to keep 18 or you could say you know what I'm going to follow my this 100% variation so in this Supply you you're going to say okay I'm going to 21 so this is a manual thing because I don't want this to to be automatic because it will impact uh your supply chain and your inventory management a lot and if it's too much automa you can lose control of that so I like to really like compare these two oh sorry I did a v look up it's much more efficient you can just compare these two and for example for China China n you can see there is a big difference so you need to decide okay what happened and if you feel your agree with that you can say Okay 129 and I will automatically change all your safety stock your RAR the point automatically so that's a big big paramet that's why I'm taking a lot of time for this because it's very important to have this information as accurate as possible in your system and in the next video we're going to talk about the level of uncertainty to have a safety lead time
now let's talk about lead time uncertainty so we do have the average but now let's have the the the level of uncertainty and the safety to face this so before that I have an exercise for you maybe you know this one from my last live Workshop but I want to do it again because this is a good one so for you which one do you think is the most relable supplier between supplier one two and three you have one they all have the same contract Le time 80 days and the average for the first one is 95 the second one 8 3 and the third one 92 so which one is the best you will probably say okay this is the number two because you have a low difference between these two right so now I give you okay I give you the answer but with more information so the this is you have 10 ERS for this supplier same for this two and the same for the three and this is the pattern for every orders and now I ask you the same question okay what is the the who is the most reliable which one is the most reliable supplier because you this one has the best delay average but it looks like it's a bit so what who do you think is the best one okay so if you know don't know the answer the answer is this one the first one for me is is very reliable because it's quite stle the problem is we just need to change the average L time that's what I I was explaining to you before I don't see I don't have big main concern because it's very very stable you don't have a lot of variation the second one it doesn't look great because you have a lot of variation so at the end the average you are close to the average but you have you could be like 60 days or onward than 10 days which is not a good sign so it's very unstable and the third one this one is you only have one extreme case the race is very very stable but this one there is something wrong happened that's what we we've done in my previous video I explained to you okay it's probably it problem or you had a global shortage of someone forgot to scan uh this order so in this case if you ask me which one is the most stable I would say like it's probably between one and three one because it's quite sa and if we can if we really understand the rot CA I will say that super three we just need to remove this order from the calculation and this one will be super super stable okay so it's very important that you understand that the average is not won't give you the level of uncertainty it's just a number in your system but then you need to cover against the certainty and this variation so now let's go back to Excel and in Excel if I go back to my S this one yes now we're going to talk about okay how to define different level and based on this level we're going to Define different safety lead time we're going to go step by step stay with me stay with me so let's go back to pass orders and we need we have you have multiple options to do it which we can use the level of delivery on time that's a kpi or you can use the what we call the standard deviation of the the actual lead time let's check first the delivery on time just for your information I won't use this one but I think I feel it's important to calculate so what is the delivery on time is just to say okay is it on time yes or no for that you have you just need to know what does it mean to be on time and to to be on time you could have this very simple rules to say okay it's on time if my DeLay So first of all you need to calculate the delay the delay is just the actual versus the commited leate time so in this C you 4 days before in this one you have 14 days after so you have the delay then I'm going to take the absolute delay the absolute delay is just the ab the absolute value so it's always positive minus 4 become four and 14 remain 14 and then you need to Define okay but what does it mean to be late and most of the companies have a policy in number of days if you are Min - 7 or plus s days you are okay if you are before you are early early do we have any early yes for example this one you are 20 days in advance you are too early so if it's too early you have it's not good to be too early as well because you don't have space in the warehouse you may pay before as well so it really depends on your payment on your cash to cash CLE and payment but this is something very important and too late basically you more than seven days so you can use this in in number of days or in percentage if you want to go further out to track I'm going to remove this if you want to go further so I use this formula it's very simple if my DeLay So it's my [Music] absolute a little mistake it's absolute delay yeah or whatever no no no it's this one if my delay if it's less than - 7 is early if it's more it's late otherwise it's okay you can use this formula if you want to go further into how to really track the performance of your of your supplier in this one I just did the dot and the dot is only if it's okay 100% if it's not okay 0% based on this all stue and then to have the total level of D you go to this one and you just do the average here we're going to remove this don't you have the order do so this delivery on time is the average per order so we don't use the the value we don't we won't use the weight of every order in value this is just to give you one example how to track it I prefer to use the value but I won't have much time because I want to keep it very simple straight to the point if you want to track the full performance of your supplier not only for the lead time I have you can check if you are not already part of it I have a full course called SM matrics and in procurement I'm going to teach you how to create not only about lead time but for the full a full dashboard per supplier and where is that yeah suppliers and I'm going to tell you how to create to calculate not only the the lead time but also the delivering in quantity in quality and the full cot so I'm I'm going to spend much more time please uh but check my C if you don't have it yet it's a full you're going to go much deeper into that but for regarding Inventory management I don't want to spend three hours on suppliers today so I'm going to focus on the most important okay so what is the most important that was about do but now let's talk about uh the level of uncertainty the level of a centy we're going to use something very similar to the XYZ classification we're going to use the standard deviation and what is the standard deviation once again is what is the average deviation versus the average and for this one I'm going to go back to this tab to do it with you I'm going to take my actual time again and it's important to use the one that is clean with we we don't have the we clean from the maximum values more more than 100% otherwise you will have a wrong standard deviation as well so we're going to use this one and this time you can use directly the standard deviation perfect so you could also use for the ABC for the XYZ classification you could use the the pivot table you don't have to display all your your weeks or years or months to calculate the standard deviation but I feel it's important to see the value at least for the products but if you if you trust your data you can do it this way okay great so now we have the standard deviation per with actual time so we are not using the No Cap Max because we we want to avoid this kind of situation we want to remove this one and for that that's what I was explaining in my previous video we used this percentage of variation to clean all of this okay maybe it's too much today but at least you see you you understand the full potential of it and you can come back to this after great so we do have this standard standard deviation actually time we have the delivery on time I use the same but I won't use it so I can keep it and then what is the level of uncertainty the level of uncertainty is just a division between your standard deviation and your actual lead time so it's quite similar to the a XY Z analysis I'm going to zoom I'm going to divide this actual standard divis actual time by the actual time and I will give you a level of percentage variation and the higher is the percentage the higher is the level of uncertainty okay so then you could use this value directly but I feel this is this is a lot this is too much and I like to keep it very simple in three categories for my suppliers I like to have low level of uncertainty medium level and high level why is three level because you will also probably if you have for example super only few orders for example this one you may want to do it manually but you don't want to Define okay the percentage of a certainty is 27% you want to keep it very simple for example when I was doing consulting with bsh or Red Bull we wanted to keep it very simple for everyone and in your file when you see this file you want to see only three maximum four categories and I like Simplicity it won't change much and uh I feel it's very it's much easier to understand for your team for for everyone and also it's easy if you want to Define manual parameters okay so I like to Define three categories and in these three categories I will have this table and I will Define okay if I have more than 10% variation then it's low if it's less than 20% sorry less than 10 low less than 20 medium and more than 20 high once again you don't have a golden rule for this 10 20 or 30% you will really depend on your suppliers so I recommend you to play with these numbers and to have this role so I just say like if this is less than 10 then low if less than 20 than medium if not high okay but it's completely automatic and then for for the for the to to adjust these parameters you can just count so I'm just counting here I have a count if medium low and I like ABC analysis and XY Z and you can adjust to say no I have 50% of my suppliers less than 10 so let's say no I want to I want to go to 5% why not you could do that but I feel that 10% is good enough for variations I will keep 10 20 even if I have 50% of my supplier low it's okay you don't have to respect the symbol than XY Z because in this case um I feel like you don't need to to put even more safety for for these suppliers okay so then you can check manually one or 12 itms I always recommend to filter by descending number of orders because the most important at this one you can also make keep check the biggest suppliers in terms of value of purchase and this one are quite important to Define okay so you have these two levels three levels you have the number of suppliers we are almost done and then you need to define a safety lead time to say okay if my my level of is low I don't I don't want to have too much safety Le time remember in the foundation level I was doing that manually with my with my guts so I was do saying okay this one is our label zero 0.5 this one is one this one is one two we want to do it automatically once again because I love automation so let's Define a simple rules if my Supply is low I will just add 5% of safety LM or even zero if you want but let's let's add 5% if it's medium 15% if it's High 30% CU I don't want to have I don't want to double my lead time just because it's not um I have a long uncertainty because otherwise I will have way too much sucks anyway and maybe at one point you need to change your supplier right could be your supplier or your transport so in this case I'm going to defend a very simple to say okay I will add 5% of my total lead time if it's low 15% if it's medium and 30% if it's high and what is the new safety lead time you just multiply you just V look up medium so the medium is 15% multiply by your committed lead time I recommend to use the committed lead time because at the end this is the one you're going to keep and I was explaining before that you use the actual lead time to challenge the committed lead time but then this is the one you use in your formula all right so at the end we have the commited lead time of 85 and I have a safety lead time of 12 for the low I will have six days if you don't feel comfortable to add the safety lead time you could just move this one to zero and you will have a zero safety lead time okay that's it so we have the we have three different level we have the level of uncertainty we have the safety lead time and we're going to use this in the formula to calculate your um your safety stock and your reorder point so I I want step by step you need first just to remind you the step first you update your committed lead time then you define your uncertainty level and then you include the safety lead time according to your supplier uncertainty once you have that I'm going to go back to this we go back to this file and we just V up the lead time the review period as well this is very important to consider the review period in your file because in this past order we don't have the review period we don't want I mean review period is if if I put one order every week I won't see that in this file I need to include the review period in addition to my actual lead time so I go back to my base I have my lead time my review periods and I have my Supply uncertainty and my safety L I'm going to add in my formula but we're going to see that later the last the last point is why I told you before why I have three level is sometimes you want to change manually for example for this one and say okay I Supply certainty you want to do it oh there is some yeah this one you see like like this one sometimes I won't use the formula because I don't have enough orders for for the all this new one I will do it manually so you can say no I want a medium one boom and that will automatically change my safety ler okay so it's okay to do it manually if you don't have much much data then just to do it automatically with two orders and if you have only two orders for one year you won't have any like your standard deviation doesn't mean anything so you have some manual work I recommend to do this work at least twice a year if you can one a quarter to make sure that this average lead time is relevant and if you are facing like something crazy like your supplier is getting super super late you have a problem with your transport that this us Canal is blocked again you can also change manually to say okay we have a problem with Romania we move to 25 days and automatically it will increase all the safety stock and real the point of all your products from Romania for example so that's it for the late time was a long video but that was a very important one and I hope this is clear in the next video we're going to talk about how to integrate this lead time into the Safety stock and re the point formula
all right Lami we're going to talk about economic order quantity EQ and the willson formula I've done a YouTube video I'm going to put the link below this video but you you don't have to follow this one because I'm going to go back to all the the principle and calculation so what is economic order quantity is the most economic way to order your product and it's the same quantity Val quantity value for every for different items so of course you don't want to have the same quantity between two different items with two different demands if you sell one product every year and the other one you sell 1 million you don't want to have the same economic order quality we're going to implement that for every single item in this Excel file you the question is is it better for you to order every once a year and optimize for example the purchasing purchasing price and maybe to fill your container and optimize your transport or is it better to maybe order every day so if you order maybe every day or every minute you will have as you will optimize your inventory level because you will just order what you really need but it could be very exhausting like this very cute cat to order like each time you sell a product you order a new one okay so that's the re question how to find this balance and to find this balance we we have this economic order quantity and we we basically we're going to find the balance between the holding cost or inventory and the transaction cost and the IDE is really to optimize between these two and scientific and work for many years to find what is the best formula we don't have to rein invent the mat we just have to apply this formula on one side you have what we call the holding cost the more you will increase your order quantity the more you will have to you will have holding costs in terms of inventory in some of storage etc etc I'm going to get back to all the details and on the other side you have the transaction cost and if you have very small order quantity you have a lot of work for the transaction to make this order happening in terms of invoicing uh time for for your team etc etc I'm going to get back to this so what is important is to find this to what is the total cost and the total cost you have an inflection point and this is the lowest total cost that you want to have to find the balance between this famous holding cost and transaction cost okay so there is a Formula you just have to apply this formula the formula is I'm going to give you example just after you have the demand we have the transaction cost TC and you have the holding cost HC and you just have to do the rot square of two times the demand multiply by the transaction cost divided by the alling cost okay so to give you one example we I use this example in my Youtube video um the demand is the quantity forecast it for a period if you have the forecast if you don't have the forecast you can use the consumption okay it's not a big deal to use the consumption it's a good start I'm going to give you more example for example this um Nike isues 12,000 quantity or for the next year uh this is per it's very important to do it per item not per like if you have for example shoes you have to do it per size you don't do it uh at the super model level because you you you will have a different production and you will have a different order quantity per size it's the same for a factory if you have different um piece from the same supplier or they you just have a size difference for example or color difference it's very important that you do it at the item the smallest level possible otherwise you will have way too much talk for the extreme size for example all right so for the holding cost I'm going to go back to the Excel after but this is just one example you have the annual demand the purchasing price the annual cost you have the insurance expenses if you have insurance cost they could be also part directly of the the storage cost so you need to check with your Finance with the finance department you have the cost of money how much is your money and the money is a the cost of money is increasing right now with inflation and interest rates you have the inventory Gap like is what is which what part of the stock basically is stolen or disappeared after your inventory check or stock Tech you also have the promotion cost how much will be the promotion cost like because you have too much stock you need to to promote and to get this number uh just it's not that easy to get this number but just try to find the difference between the what we call the catalog price and the real price at the end if you are in the in the retail industry in the factory we should you should not have more much more promotion it's more about uh inventory Gap or maybe um this you can you could replace the promotion cost by the destruction cost okay so that's for the holding cost and on the other side you have the transaction cost you have multiple way to do it you could you could take the the the cost of the full department is responsible for that or maybe okay if one Department takes 20% of his time to raise order you could say okay we have 1 million order per per year the cost of department is 10 million so we divide and divide the the cost by the number of ERS and you have your cost or you could just give an estimation uh for the time you spend and you just have also an estimation for the the early rate with tax for every for every order this is just one example you don't have to be perfect for this one it's like the first one the most important is to to be close to it and at the end like for the olding cost what is important is not the cost per in dollar but the percentage cost and for this one is what is the cost in in dollar or Euro or whatever is your currency uh but you have multiple steps you have the ordering process the order validation the communication with suppliers the followup reception inspection putting into storage supplier payments if you need to have some people to for example reclaim a payment that are late etc etc and at the end you have what we call transaction cost in this example is $42 okay so we have this cost and this cost then if you go back to the formula the the eoq is equal to 2 * the demand multip by the transaction cost divided by H um holding cost and we do the root square of that and the form the result for this one will be 598 and sometimes it's good to run up if you can do it you can run up you don't have to do it but it's just just good sometime when you have 598 just keep it simple it will also depend on your load size I recommend to to round up with your loot size if you have also have for example a lot size of two pieces or 10 pieces then you go to 600 and you have your economic order quantity okay so that is for for the formula you can also use this formula to Define what is the best frequency to order every year to be honest I'm not using this formula a lot because I feel that it's more I was talking about when to order in the previous module you can use it as information but it would be too complex to have a different frequency per product like if you had like okay this one I need to order every month the other one every week or the other one every 3 days at one point is going to going to be a mess if you have to wait too many things to do so you can do it if you have an automatic system but if not I will just keep it very simple and I will just use the economic order quantity plus the Safety stock all right so we have this order frequency you will divide 365 by 20 and you have one order every 18 days if you want to use this formula now we go back to to this example you have an eoq of 600 and every 18 days you are going to order this that's the the principle in reality see you have to be very careful because you I really recommend you to use this EQ to challenge the minimum order quantity from your supplier I was talking about that before I will reinis and I will give you more example in the the expert level if your economic order is for example 120 quantity and your supplier say no no you need to order under 3,000 quantities there is a big problem there is a big problem and you're going to you're going to have a lot of issues with Overstock just because of the minimum order quantity so you can use this EQ to challenge your supplier and for example if you have one year forecast and your suppliers is 500 quantity just do the calculation on your science say to the supply look it's it's really not profitable I'm going to have five years inventory if I take your minimum order quantity and that's another tool to help you to assess if you if you have your mq I way toi or not all right so now I was a bit fast but let's get one example that was the first example the second one so you just go to the eoq tab and in this eoq tab I just take one example what is important is not this annual demand because we're going to we're going to apply the same R the same rate for every everyone just take one random price whatever and in this one you have the um what is important is more the the percentage so you need to define the percentage for everything annual unit cost insurance expense I will probably increase the cost of money to 4% right it's getting more expensive to get the cash flow right now inventory Gap promotion cost etc etc you can replace the the promotion cost by destruction cost if you are in the industry for example and at the end what is important is the total value you have this is the the value for $3 but what is import is okay in average my stock cost me 12.5% a year which is much more than people think most of the time people will only think oh my my cost is only like few few per for the interest rate of the of the FED but at the end we never get the the rate from the FED we get the the rate from the bank they take a profit so the cost of money more is more than we think and also we have much more cost like Pro promotion could even be to 10% sometimes for the fashion industry or even 20% so you can really go exponential you have to be very aware of this cost you don't have to be perfect either it's okay if you don't exactly know just talk maybe 15 minutes with your with your CFO to see for CFO is for Chief Financial Officer to see okay what what would be something like um relevant and you can adapt this these values after same for the the transaction cost this is another example at the end we have a cost of $47 and at the end we have this formula for one item but what is important for you you don't want just for one item you don't want to do it one by one okay what is the demand blah blah blah blah blah you want to do it for all your base and that's the big difference between YouTube and my courses I explain to you how to to scale and how to do it automatically and it's very simple what we're going to do now we're going to go back to the base great going to zoom and on the right so all of this we already have supplers I'm going to get back to supplers after we have a section called EQ and we have two columns the first one you have this you just need to have a link equal to your percentage this one 12 12.5 all right great do this 12.5 and then you just need for the holding cost you just need to apply what is the cost of your product so it could be the cogs the the real cost of your products when you buy it or the average cost or the just the cost price if you don't have it and you multiply this two 12.5% by this cost price and that will give you a different holding cost for every produ why because every product has a different value if you one product like this one product like let's keep simple this one cost $100 if you keep this product for one year in your company the cost will be $12.5 okay but for this one which is much more cheaper like this one because the cost of the produ is lower the oing cost will be lower per product right it makes sense perfect then we have the transaction cost and the transaction cost is very simple you just put equal go to EQ and this time you don't take the percentage you take the the Val the the dollar because whatever you you are putting an order for one quantity or 50 quantity the price should be the same or almost the same if you have difference you could have more complex formula but I will keep it very simple and at the end you just put equal this you log the formula and that's it and you have all the always the same transaction cost you don't even need a column for that but I just put one column because sometime you could say ah from this supplier maybe it's a different cost because if it's from China you have more paperworks you could have a dynamic cost per per supplier I won't do that but it's possible so that's why I like to have one colum for each specific item and you could have like one per supplier or one per category or brand or family if you feel this is different but at the at the beginning I will keep it very simple it's important to have a value to balance the cost and the trans the holding cost and the transaction cost okay then we have going to zoom see it looks complex but it's not EQ EQ I'm going to apply the same formula so two times in this case I don't have forast in the in the expert level we're going to use the forecast but in this one we don't have forecast yet it's okay it's not it's not a problem you can you can do most of your inventory management without any forecast I mean we do have a forecast with seasonality but in this case I recommend to take the 52 weeks uh demand to have like where is the global demand you could use if you feel you have a lot of new products coming frequently it will make sense to maybe take a shorter per like three three months or six months but the best will be to use okay what is the next the forecast for the next year and you use this forecast but in this case we're going to use the 52 weeks once again you don't have to be perfect it's not because you don't have forast it's not because you don't have clean sales history that you Cann use it to be honest you be better to use not the sales but the demand if you have the demand it's even better because sometimes you you are not supplying all the demand but that's a good start and we we're going to stay with that okay if you are looking for Perfection you will do nothing and it's very important to always go to 80% of accuracy do the job improve your performance and then improve later if you have the time for that so the the formula is two times the demand this time we're going to use 52 weeks sales quantity multiply by the transaction cost $47 divided by the holding cost and if we have an error we just put zero because we don't we don't want to have um we need to have a quantity at least okay that's it for the that's it for the EQ and then what we're going to do we're going to round up this EQ to the the loot size why because we we want to have like something like if your loot size is 36 you can't really have some 305 quantity we want to have 324 so we just divide the EQ by the load size you round up like we did before for the orders and you multiply Again by the load size and we do have the EQ with the load size and this is the one that we're going to use for the next calculation so that's it for the EQ you see it's not it's not that complex you don't have to be perfect for all these parameters you can play with that and of course if you change to okay now my promotion cost is 5% and you go back to the to the base that will increase all your EQ so it's a very powerful tool as well I'm going to go back to this you can play with that it's also very I really like to have the to to play with this tool with the CEO of the company of the the finance you can also use it in in the snop meeting it's a very good way to explain to people hey guys it's not only about service it's also about uh the cost for the team and the transaction cost obviously if you have the capacity to generate a lot of orders without any cost that's also a very good way but we're going to talk about that uh later if you really want to optimize that
in this video I'm going to talk about the limits of the EQ formula the limits of the EQ first of all it's about the demand if you use for example the last 52 weeks sales or even the forecast you know that the demand is not consistent you have Peaks like for example Black Friday or you have a big production to launch for your factory before summer etc etc so for that there is it's okay that's why I recommend to take a long period just to have an average you don't have to make it perfect or you do it per for example every qu you have a different economic AO qualtity but it's already a very complex and advanced level but you could do it for very specific item that represent a lot of stock I also recommend to do maybe a specific forecast for your top maybe top 5% item in terms of volume of purchase and also I don't necessarily recommend to apply what the what we what we calculated before regarding the order frequency recommendation it some times you can you can have more than one estim estimated order quantity could be two EQ sometimes just to face the demon okay so that's the first one the second one is you could have an inconsistency regarding the the PCH purchasing price you could have a specific price for 1 to 10 quantity then uh different price for plus plus than 100 quantities etc etc you probably know this kind of purchasing price you have once again you have multiple solution you could have a Z with your supply to say no I don't want this table I want to keep it very simple and you just just use an average you could also accept that it's not perfectly optimized and you just use the average what is the average purchase price per item or you could have a dynamic dienic way to optimize your EQ it's more complex I'm not going to do that here because you you need more much more time for that and I don't feel this is a this is the this is something very very relevant I could spend maybe two or three hours just on this one so keep it very simple at the beginning and if you have time just focus on the most important item and do it manually if necessary it's very important to understand that you don't need to recalculate the EQ every single day uh it's automatic in my file but I recommend to do it uh maybe once every quarter or once every six months even once a year sometimes it really depends if you have a lot of new products coming I would do it every quarter if you don't have many new products just do it every six months and I will that will be enough uh at the beginning especially if you do everything with Excel okay the next one is inconsistent cost of course we are using like average cost for storage for insurance for promotion uh once again you have um you have fixed cost and you have variable cost so it's not possible to have something perfect but you can use an the average cost again or you could use different cost per type of products for example if you have one product with a lot of a group of products for example you do fashion with a lot of promotion you could you could say that you have a different promotion cost for different group of products or categories and you have a lower cost for others same for storage if you have like very like big um like products with a big volumes you will pay much more than products very small so you could have a different cost for different type of products you just need to add the information if you already have the information you can do it uh dyam dynamically in your Excel just to explain to you how to do it instead of having if I go back for example you want to have a different annual unit cost per type of products and a promotion C what you can do in the file is instead of having two columns here you could insert maybe one colum per parameter you could have the promotion cost promotion you could have the storage and you could add all these parameters one by one and apply the formul directly into this file so I I won't do that here you or you could have a specific spreadsheet just for that okay so you have two options or you do it once the same for all of them or you do a specific you could do a big Simulator for that but we're going to it will be much more advanced and I feel you already get it right so keep it simple then we also have inconsistent Le time u in consistently time um we know that the lead time is not perfect sometimes we have to 20 days sometimes we have 40 days what is really important with the lead time we're going to do that later is really to track what is the correct average lead time and most of the company they don't even have the correct average lead time so it's very important to track with every suppliers what is your real lead time and then we're going to talk about all the safety parameters we can use to face this inconsistent lead time and then we don't have any safety because we know we can sell more than than we expected we can also have delay with the suppliers and that's why we need to include the Safety stock and that will be the subject of the next episode is to Define what is the best Safety stock formula but at the end yeah we'll have we'll have a YouTube video for that as well but my my recommendation if you never use the EQ formula before start simple now and optimize later this is the mindset of J Bezos the the mo most of your decision should be probably made with something like 70% of the information not 80 90% otherwise you will be too slow so keep it simple start now and optimize later
all right now we're ready for Safety stock I hope you are ready too so we've been working the last uh the last episodes to increase the number of parameters with EQ demand and certainty XY Z Supply and lead time and certainty also the new average lead time we're going to also use all these parameters and the idea is really to go to the pro level with safety stock so get ready for that before we go to excel again I just wanted to remind you and the principle so we had the eoq before the IDE is to order the the same quantity to make it like more profitable in terms of holding cost and trans transaction costs but we do have some uncertainty regarding lead time and and demands that's why we need to combine EQ and Safety stock okay just to make sure we don't we don't have too much shortage we we we we should accept shortages but not too much okay then we have this CQ we need to combine these two and one of the classic mistake I've seen before is the Safety stock is not the reorder Point okay if you order once you reach the the Safety stock it's too late because you have the lead time of your supplier so you need to order before you reach the the Safety stock so this is the average lead time that I was talking about during my previous episode this is very important to have an accurate average lead time plus safety H we're going to talk about it later in the formula okay so we do have these and you're the one EQ or maybe one more more than one EQ if you if you have much less or if you're close to zero it's not a problem but at this one EQ and the reality is more like this like this is like on the paper it looks like this clean but the reality is more like messy but at the end it's still safe and maybe one one day you will have a shortage but most of the time you will reach maybe 90 to 95% of service for your customer okay a big big big big warning Safety stock is not the ultimate solution it's always easy to say okay I have a problem with my focus accuracy with my suppliers with my inventory management policy with my warehouse with with it um I have a lack of communication I have a lack of skills and training so let's just increase the safety right and most of the time my my CEO or my sales director was saying Ed you should increase the safety St we have out of stock okay but you can't do that all the time it's just you will you won't fix the problem like this you need to find the right balance but you need also to fix the root cause of your problems it's most of the time I see that companies use safety to hide the the real issues of the company and it's just not profitable for them and I can also tell you that the the inventory cost is mostly underestimated by the companies it's not two or 3% it could be 15 20 50% if you work in the food industry or fast fashion industry for example so you can check the video with the EQ I'm talking about the the real cost of holding inventory but it's very important that Safety stock is not about safety it's finding the balance between the customer service and the inventory cost okay so I did a lot of videos I was talking about this kpis in the foundation level go back to this episode if you are not sure about it but the important is really to understand this is not about safety this is about uh finding the balance so that was quick introduction in my my next video I'm going to show you the different methods and then I'm going to explain to you how to implement them in the Excel file I'm going to test different methods and tell you how to select the right one there we go
so now let's talk about the different methods for Safety stock the first one is what we call the old school formula so I'm going to going to go quick for this one is the most I think the most common formula today is just like you have an average sales and you're going to multiply by a number of number of safety days so let's say for example you sell 100 quantities per day and you're going to say okay I want 10 days I you have a lead time of 10 days and you want a safety of 5 days okay so the safety store will be 100 * 5 I want five days of safety right five days looks good then I'm I'm good so that's the first one it's not super it's not very very efficient to be honest and the rear open point will be Safety stock plus um s is average sales multiply by lead time 500 + 100 * 10 means, 1500 quantities so if you go back to this I'm going to give you more example with more complex formula but just to really understand your re point is500 your safety stock is 500 and then let's say that you have an EQ of 2,000 you're going to order 2,000 all right so that was the first example very simple example now let's go back to the disadvantage of this solution it's really basic it's too manual because you need to Define manually and the problem is we won't consider any demon uncertainty or lead time uncertainty and you rely too much on experience and not data I've seen many companies there is one person maybe two person and they say yeah trust me I take care of the Safety stock and they do it manually you have 10,000 products so it's impossible to check them um all of them manually when this person leave the company no one knows exactly so no one touch the parameters and at the end you have massive over sto and shortage so I really don't recommend to do that only if you have really really low sales and unable data but at least if you do that do a different coverage for ABC and XYZ classification but of course I don't recommend this one then we have the we call The Prudent man method so I didn't find a good translation but like French speaking will be the good the good father want to take care of this family okay it's a bit cliche but that's there is a it's called the B the family in French okay so you see this this father you want to you want you want to protect the family whatever like any any but even like pandemic War you just want to make sure that everything will be fine for the kids and the family uh this one is a bit better um you you will use the maximum sales and the maximum lead time minus the average sales and the average lead time so let go back into Excel now I think it's much more efficient into Excel in Excel if you go to the right oh and so I didn't mention much the the old school method let's go back to it quickly before going back to the The Good the good f so I'm going to use the same data set for all the methods this is quite simple to start and then we're going to use my file uh we have we have sales per month this time you can use it per month or per week but just have to be careful to always use the same uh time frame if if you work in months you need to use everything in months if you work in week you need to use everything by week I'm going to give you example just after so your average per month will be 1 per month all right your average per day will be this if you want to to have it per day and let's say this is a manual parameter you want 15 days of safety days all right so your safety will be simply your average per day multiply by 15 so you do have 493 days of safety and then your REO point will be average lead time multiply or you can use also the forecast so this is just to keep it simple this is we had 10 deliveries over the last for example um 12 months this is not per month this is the number of delivery and this is the lead time so you do have the lead time per delivery we we've done a lot of example before in the in the previous episode your average lead time is 35 and your maximum lead time is 40 Just for information okay so you can see the sales and the different shipments great so we can use this formula and this formula is just the Safety stock plus average sales multiply by average lead time okay perfect so that was the first that was the first method very basic because this is uh this is just manual you could go to 20 there is no like real mathematics or science behind that the second one what we call the average Max the average Max this time we're going to use we need to to have okay what was the max sales per month 1200 why is the max sell daily you just divide the max by 30.5 why 3.5 because you have month with 30 days and you have other month with 31 days except February and then you do the same for the lead time you want to know okay what was the max lead time and then the formula is just you're going to do Max lead time multiply by Max sales minus average time mtip by average sales so you're going to cover from the worst scenario the worst scenario that happened with the and you're going to cover against this maximum scenario to have like this time a safety of 4 2 three days and the rearo point is the same formula what I don't like with this formula so it's a good way like if you really really want to play safe and you have also a lot of historic if you don't have historic you your max won't won't mean a lot if you only have like two or three shipment or two or three months history it won't be that easy to have something relevant also if you have one crazy shipment for example to 80 Days like for example this one you because of one delivery you're uh um your safety Stu will be massive so for that you can also I was explaining that in the in the previous videos I have a I have a method to avoid to have huge lead time so you can use the the parameters I did a specific episode to to clean automatically more than 100% variation on time that would be one solution but at the end I'm not a big fan of this uh solution because it could have a massive impact on your on your um um Safety stock okay so that was the second uh the second method that I don't really recommend unless you have like you don't have much um you really want to play safe and you don't want you it's quite difficult to use for example the standard deviation then we go to the new methods so this methods you have methods three four five and six and this time we are going to use the what we call the normal distribution so this is not the first time I'm talking about the normal distribution was talking about it for the the dynamic minan Max ratio and just to just to give you another quick introduction the normal distribution will give you like a percentage of probability we give you a safety parameters according to probability that you will supply the demand or not so you have this normal distribution is symmetric that means that for example you your average Sal is 100 per 100 per day you have as much chance and probability to sell more than 100 than less than 100 tomorrow okay this is a symmetric one and the the bigger is the area the the bigger is the probability so you have more probability to to sell 100 one than 400 quantities tomorrow and the same for on the other side the other thing with the normal distribution is you you can use the formula to give you okay but what is what will be the the safety parameter to cover X percentage of my uh of my demand what is the what is what would be the the safety parameters if you want to cover for example 90% of my demand you will need to use a safety of 1.28 and that will give you like that will give you this this safety parameter called Z will give you like this safety to to cover against your de demand uncertainty so you don't have to understand the full science behind that the normal distribution is is a good start it's not perfect but it's very easy to use because if you say Okay I want 95 I will have automatically one parameters if you want 60 you will have another parameters and this is I like it because this is quite simple um and it's also easy to implement with the Safety stock formula okay so most of the companies today use this distribution method this method is not perfect I'm going to get back to this just after so how to use this you have a formula called nms nors in and this formula will give you automatically what is the ratio you need to use in the formula so if I put for example 95 I have 1.64 okay I was explaining that before it's also interesting to see like if you don't want to have any safety we going to go back to the the formula after you put 50% because if you put 50% you accept that okay you you are you just you are just going to use the average sales and your with your R Doo if you say like basically oh my average sale is 100 per day if to I don't use any safety let's say you don't have any leite time if you sell 1001 tomorrow you will miss one sell if you sell 99 you will be fine okay so if you want safety you have to put basically 50% and you will have no Safety stock for you it may be a bit too much if you are not used to mathematics but you don't have to to fully understand that you just need to to understand the principle the bigger is the ra the if you want to cover your full probability to cover the full demand you will need to put 99.999% and it's exponential the more you go close to 100% the more your ratio is is increasing very fast to move for example from 80 to 85 you only increase by 0.16 and to move from 95 to 99.9 you double your parameters because it's much more difficult to um it's much it's impossible basically to cover 100% of your R so if I put 99.9 I have this but if you put 99999 your ration no is five okay and you can do I was doing that before you can do this curve inste just to understand that this is an very like not exponential but almost exponential in the way if you want to cover on the left of the this is not a straight line okay so great now we have this parameter it's okay just stay with me now we have different formulas the first one is the most common method three we are only going to uh have safety on the demon why we only have on the demon because we feel like okay for the lead time we don't want to have too much safety or you can use a safety in a different way I'm going to get back to this after so the formula is very simp simple you multiply Z and Z is your targeted service rate or it's not really the service that you're going to have in your factory on your warehouse but this is the targeted service um rate that you want to cover the the demand okay so we we're going to start with n and then I'm going to explain to you how to optimize and how to define different targets per group of products but let's say you want to Target 90% so the 90% will give you 1 28 so you're going to multiply 1.28 multiply by the Dem standard deviation so the Dem standard deviation we know that from from before you do the standard deviation of your data points in this this in this specific case we do have it per month but you could have it per week it's very important that if you use per week you need to use all your information per week and not per month I'm going to give you more example after and then you need to have the the square root of the average Le time your average lead time is 35 days so you're going to do the formula with this information be very careful when you do the formula I did this mistake also many times multiply 1.28 time 141 so the demon standard deviation but the square root be very careful don't do the square root for 35 days because this is incorrect why because you have the 141 is the the the standard deviation per month so you need also to have the lead time per month or you do the opposite but you can't use the average lead time per day otherwise your safety your safety store will be completely wrong if I do uh this the square root of sorry if I do the square root of so you have we have a safety of 12494 sorry if I use per day have 1, which is completely different why because we have to be very careful I just had to convert my ear lead time into months so for the first Formula we do have 194 quantity great and the real point is just your average average sales multiply by lead time plus Safety stock so we have 194 and 1345 this is one of the most common formula that we're going to use we're also going to use other formulas but just to keep it simple we only focus on the uncertainty of the demon there is no safety for the lead time the second one we say no this time no there is no we know exactly what's going to happen uh with the with the with the future for the demon we only want uncertainty we only want to cover against the lead time so in this Cas we're going to we're going to invert the formula this time we're going to multiply Zed multiply by average sales multiply by the lead time standard deviation and the lead time standard deviation we use the same formula standard deviation of your lead time okay this time we are using average Sal per day so you can also use the lead time standard deviation per day so you don't need to convert and at the end we have something quite similar 183 days great great so now let's talk about method five and six method five and six this time we're going to combine in the in the same formula the uncertainty for the lead time and for the demon okay so in these two the first one the uncertainty of the demon are independent and the second one they are dependent what does it mean when it's independent or dependent when it's independent that means that if you have a delay with your supplier or the the variation of your lead time won't impact the demand on the method six these two are related like you for example if you have a monopoly if you have a monopoly business for example Apple I do feel like when Apple decide on purpose to have some delay on the new iPhone and new Macbook they also influence the demand for for all the products and for the specific products so if for sure the method six will have more safety than the method five what are the formulas the formula for method 5 is a bit complex to be honest uh you just have to apply it and you can just just use my formula but you're going to multiply the Z coefficient by the square root of the average lead time multiply by the demon deviation square plus average say plus L standard deviation squar this like mathematician did the job for you you don't have to to to do it to reinvent everything and for method six because the the two these two are dependent you're going to have more safety stock and the formula is much simpler you just need to sum method three and Method four so you you just sum these two quantities and you have this one so you will have less for this one but for this for the method six you will have the maximum lead time possible uh because uh because you you you feel like these two are are impacting each other okay so at the end you have all this methods and what is important is also whatever is the method the targeted service rate is very important I will do a very specific video how to optimize and what would be the best rure but for example if I move to 99% boom I'm doubling all my safety stock if I go to 50 my safety stock are all zero okay so it's very this parameters is very important to set it's also exponential if I go from 90 to 99 I'm doubling oop not this one I'm doubling my safety stock okay so let's keep it simple and start with 90 so in my next video I'm going to tell you which one is the the method I recommend and how to implemented in this file with the the full database
in this video we're going to talk about okay which one is the best method Ed I'm I'm I'm really confused with all this mathematics formulas no worries we're going to go step by step so if before we go back to the the file it's important to compare the all the values when I check the old school method it's not you can't really compare this one because of the the the number of safet days is completely manual you could per 40 there is no it's completely manual but you can start comp from this one this one has 423 days of safety the real point is always the same formula you just have to keep in mind something very important when we talk about lead time it's important to also include the review period that's what we're going to do in the current file if this lead time has to consider the review period if it's not part of it you need to include it in the average lead time um for the re point and also for the safety stock formula so I'm going to get back to this after but regarding if you want to compare the values we have 423 days we have this one is 377 267 and this one are less than 200 so if you really want to cover like if you want to be a good father from your your family this is the safest way but it will double your level of safety some which is a lot so I do not recommend this one unless you really you really don't want to do any standard deviation and you don't have enough data set for demand and for the sales and for the delete time you can try and see the best way is always to compare on your top sellers and on your on low sales and see what are the results so which one do I recommend I recommend method three and I recommend method five I do prefer method three because this one is simple I do not consider the the uncertainty on time why because we already done that in my previous episode so hopefully you remember that but in my previous episode if you check this base we do have Supply and certainty low medium and high we do use also the standard deviation that but I like to classify only in three categories and I also like to to Define what we done last time we in this one we Define okay what will be the safety lead time based on the supply uncertainty and it's much I feel it's it's safe it's it's safe in a in a way because you can control it and if you don't have much historic on your suppliers if you only have like three orders or three shipment from one supplier you don't want to only trust this Safety stock formula I prefer to control it and keep it very simple and you can also adjust the parameters for that so if you don't understand what I'm talking about please go back to my previous video regarding lead time and Superior uncertainty okay so that's why that's my it's like this is my own invention like I didn't find this in the book To be honest but I I feel it's much simpler also to explain and also for the classification so when if we go back to the question which one do I recommend maybe I should should write a book who knows and if I go back to my classific to my what is the best method sorry I was thinking of my book and my my Nobel Prize maybe one day I don't think so so I recommend a method three and I'm too straight to the point to have a Nobel priz maybe for Simplicity who knows anyway I'm I'm going back to the to the Safety stock I do recommend this one plus the the safety lead time we did that together we're going to we're going to connect all the dots after or you could also do use this one you can try this one and we're going to use these two and compare which one uh which one is the the best for the the current items and base we have this one is only based on lead time and I can tell you that it's most of the time the demand is not super stable so I don't really recommend this one and this one for me give you way too much Safety stock so I don't recommend this one okay so now that we have the the two winners method three and Method five so let's do it in the file let's go back to the base what do we need for the safety stock if you go on the right in the formula of the Safety stock here we are we have so you have the Safety stock method three and we have the Safety stock method five you can see the five here okay cool so we're going to we're going to start with the simple one what do we need to use we need to use the standard deviation of the demand the coefficient the service coefficient and the lead time and the review period because I was telling you if the lead time does not consider the review per you need to include it so where where is the standard Devi standard deviation of the demand coming from I think it's here where is the standard deviation coming from it's somewhere there we go so we need to have this standard deviation and this standard deviation is coming from this part okay so we use this one for the a um a XYZ classification we're going to use the same we use it for the last 52 weeks and I explain also in the XYZ classification that you also have to be careful between the blank and the zero please go back to this episode if it's not clear for you this is very important to differentiate zero zero means you are selling it blank it it's not for sale yet or is not used in your factory so we're going to use this Colum in standard deviation and then if I go back to my formula we need to use also like we have the lead time the riew period and the standard deviation so what we're going to start is if my salue is discontinued I'm going to put zero I don't want to have any safety if my product is not active Okay then we're going to apply the formula standard deviation multiply by the the coefficient of service and the coefficient of service we're going to start simple we're going to start with 90% so you have you can have a fixed one or you can have an optimized one I'm going to do a specific video for that but let's keep it simple first let's start from this let's start from the same ratio for all your products okay and then we're going to use an optimize service Target but I want to go step by step first so we do have this service 1.3 and I just use the formula Norm end of the of the percentage it's just a it's always the same value and then I multiply by the square root of the lead time plus the review period it's very important to don't forget the review periods okay so we have all this formula and it's very important that you don't forget you see like in this one I divide by seven why Ed are you dividing by seven why because the standard deviation of my demon if we check the standard deviation this is per week okay and it's very important this is a big mistake I've done many many times and I've seen many many times if your standard deviation is per week you need also to use your if I go back to this you need to have your lead time per week and not per day so when we say 120 plus 7 days we need to convert this into week okay so that's why I'm dividing the lead time plus the r divided by seven otherwise I will have a huge safety stck I will have a massive Safety stock if I remove that I will have massive Safety stock that I really don't need so be careful really be careful with that and at the end we have the value for the safety stock only for active products great you can just check my file and repeat the formula but be careful with always using the same um time frame than the the standard deviation otherwise it's going to be wrong and the standard deviation most of the time or it's per month or it's per week I do not I do not recommend per day unless you are losing you are using a very short period for your sales and average sales as well so now let's compare with method number five method number five is more complex uh that's a long formula but it's good to compare with the method number three that I recommend and and then you can take your own decision so what do we need in this um in this formula we need the lead time and the review period don't forget to divide by seven we need the standard deviation of the demand we already have it we need the average size daily what is the average size daily or you could also use the forast if you have a forast but in this case we don't have we will use it for the the the expert level uh for the average sales daily this time I'm going to use eight weeks not four weeks like the minmax why because the longer is the lead time the longer I recommend to use a longer period for the average average say it's better to use average demand and sales but in this case we only have the sales so let's use the sales okay so we're going to we're going to use the average sales the daily eight weeks why H weeks as well not why you could also use 13 weeks but we have we have quite strong seasonality and we're going to we're going to use this signality for the re points so I feel like 8 weeks is the right call but you can also check with different items and feel if this is the right move or not okay so we go for that you can check my video regarding average sales if you if you want to know more about it we go back to the method this method is more is more complex it's you don't have to use it to B so you need to multiply by the coefficient the lead time you divide by seven because keep in mind that we need to convert into into weeks the standard deviation is good because we have the standard deviation in week the average say multiply by seven because we want the average say weekly and the daily because of to always have the same um the same time time frame for your formula and the standard deviation of the lead time we divide by seven because it was in week it was in days before so we convert into week so it's a bit more clearly more complex at the end it's just interesting just to check the result between this method and this method these two colum and you can see that of course you have a bit more you have more safety for the method number five like we could see before because we we need more safety for the standard deviation of the of the lead time so at the end of course this safy St is a bit lower but in the next in the next video with the REO point I'm going to explain to you how to in include the safety lead time and at the end yes this one is lower but we're going to get we're going to get a bit more safety from this methodology so these two will be quite similar but I prefer this one because this one is easier to implement easier to explain and you can also Define the safety for your suppliers manually when you don't have enough data or enough orders so that's why I recommend this one with this combination but it's just good to know that okay you don't have to over think everything at then yes you do have a difference you do have like a 10 20% difference between these two method but the most important is to start with something then to track the performance and then you can adapt that's why I recommend always the simple version before going into more complexity and I feel like this one is also more efficient and safe to do to implement and to to explain to your team okay so that's it we know we have different methods we're going to keep this one for the rest of the this the next episode and I'm going to explain to you now how to combine with real point and also how to have optimized service Target based on your ABC XYZ classification
in this video we're going to talk about the service targets uh we're going to we have only 90% for all the products we're going to switch to have a dynamic service Target but before that I wanted to go back to the limits of the normal distribution the limit like first of all when you say okay I want to have 90% of of service this is not the service you're going to get in your store or in your factory it's it's very difficult to predict what is going to happen is like having 100% of forecast accuracy you have too many parameters the demand the price the sentent so don't think like because you put 90 we have 90 that would be too easy but that's a good way to start and by I'm going to explain to you in this video how to tune these parameters and also how to adapt them the second one is like the the normal distribution we're using is not applicable it won't be perfect for all demand profiles for example for very low sales for very low sales to be honest you don't have you don't have many methods to to face that because it's 0 one then it's 0 for one or two weeks you can use the P method or this different methods but they're more complex and I do not recommend to mix different methods because it's going to be much more complex to do also the normal distribution would not consider any seasonal Factor um so if you have strong seasonality and variation it won't be like during the year and they are different they won't be considered like this but it's okay we're going to use also the seasonality for the re the point and it tends to underestimate the your extreme cases so if you sell for example 100 products a day and you are you have you have a case that you're going to sell 1,000 you won't the probability the probability will be very low so you will be out of stock for this kind of extreme case which is for me also a good sign because you don't want to Overstock everything just in case there is something crazy happening so also like these limitations sometimes are a good way to make sure you don't have not too much Safety stock in your Warehouse Factory or store okay so that's the the limits so you do have all other methods like the binomial distribution method the PO s distribution ma gas liod I'm going to cover I'm not going to cover all of them because they're more complex and I do feel like Simplicity is your best friend right now if you want to implement this and for example picking the right average sales or tuning the right lead time and safety Le time will give you much more benefit than just picking the best methodology and also I do feel like using different service Target for ABC XY Z classification will help you a lot and will be much easier to implement and to share with all the department okay so just to keep in mind the future will be not to choose the right method but to do it to have machine learning we will test maybe the 100 meod differently like automatically for every products and it will be an automatic selection for every single products this is the future I can tell you that this is this is way more complex to implement and you will have to to accept that no one really understand what's going on it's a black box and sometimes the having a black box that no one can really explain uh can be not sometimes it can be very very tricky to implement and to to add so at one point I'm going to talk about it but for most of you if you want to have like 80% of the profit and keep it simple for everyone and for implementation and still use Excel if you have the money to invest in a in an Erp the best way is to use to keep it simple with the formula we're going to use right now so in the next video we're going to use I'm going to explain to you how to optimize the ab6 YZ Target service keep it simple and see you soon
in this video let's talk about the service rate target so I was explaining before this 90% is not exactly what we're going to get in your factory or store but this is a very powerful tool if you want to have different goals for different products keep in mind we do first of all we did the ABC analysis with three categories and you could say yes I want to have more service for my a code than my C codes right then we switch to ABC XY Z with different categories regarding uncertainty for the demand and you have different policy Inventory management policy and there is not a good one you have different ones but you have two main ones the first one will focus on the service to to say like if your product has a lot of uncertainty you want to have more safety so in this one you'll say okay for my a z i want more safety than my ax for my b z i want more safety than my BX b x for my C I don't really want to have more safety whatever is your inventory management policy because this is the low sales and this one if they have a lot of uncertainties because they don't sell and they almost never sell and sometimes they sell a lot so you could have more safety but it's very very dangerous so whatever is your policy be very careful with this category because this is also most of your products in your company so be careful with that in terms of service what we're going to do now we're going to say okay we're going to we're going to have a different Target service per per group of products and this is a focus like service Focus we do have more for Zed than for x except for the C codes don't be careful with that and for the if you want to focus on the cash flow you really want to optimize your profit and your cash flow your your inventory value your you want to reduce your inventory I recommend to do the opposite you don't want to have too much safety on products that are very have a lot of volatility why because they have more volatility and certainty you will have automatically because you will have they will have a bigger standard ation or they will have a worse Focus accuracy and because of that you will have a lot of safety on products that you don't really know if they're going to sell a lot and when they're going to sell so you'll have to do more promotions you will have more cost related to this level of uncertainty so in in the I would do the opposit will have more safety on the most important one because you if you live in a very turbulent world with a lot of uncertainty regarding the supply chain it's better really to focus on the products you really know you're going to sell that the one you don't really now so we're going to switch and we going do the opposite and one of the policy will be like okay let's focus mostly on this on these products um more of course you always need more safety for the products that are more important for your business and anyway if they don't have a lot of variation the the safety St will will be lower automatically but at least the coefficient that we're going to use will be lower and for the C code you will be much more aggressive on the on this one especially the CZ you could even reduce this one and when I say 50% that means zero Safety stock okay so we're going to do that now into Excel so in Excel if you go back to XY Z here you can see that we have we have this tab we're going to use this tab to Define automatic parameters so I recommend you to do the same and then I'm going to explain to you how we can tune them and optimize them so first of all what is your focus your your focus is stock or your focus is service let's let's say that your focus is to optimize the stock you can of course change this value before but let's say like we're going to keep this and we're going to go to what we need to know you need to do vup of this to the base so to do that we want to have this optimized service Target here this one to make the link you need to have what we call a link table so for the link table you just write all this information and then you just press equal and you do it one by one just to have a table format then you can V look up okay so you do it manually equal equal equal equal you have this value and when you change for example to 50 this will will change to 50 okay it's quite complex to do a v lookup with this kind of table great so now we go to uh the base and in the base we just V Up ab and we're going to concatenate AB and this we're going to conc I'm going to do it with you again just in case we're going to concatenate this and this oh this and this and then what is the table the table is this one then we on the second column then zero okay that's it I'm going to freeze this one F4 F4 and now we're good okay so this is the formula we need we have the optimized service Target for all the categories great amazing now we're going to switch this Z into not to the fixed service Target but for this one boom so now you see you have a different service according to your like for example if you are a c code you are multiplying by 0.3 if you have an aode you're multiplying a z or ax this one you're multiplying by 2 one that's a big big difference between ax and C Cod so your your strategy will completely change you before it was very stable for everyone now you have a huge difference between your your CZ code for example and your ab ab code okay I mean it's better to have a color than you can see that and of course your safety stock formula will completely change as well because we are we are using this coefficient to multiply it will completely changeed the the game so this is what we're going to use automatically and this formula is very powerful uh and very efficient to really balance and really focus your cash flow and your energy on the most important products for your company that's why also if you feel that some products are very strategic and you you disagree with the classification a or XY Z you can do it you can force the classification manually and you can say okay I have 10 new products coming and they are very important for the business I want to have more safety so let's classic them manually a and and X to make sure that they have 98% of safety in that okay so we have this um we have this classification and now you will ask me but okay but how do we optimize how do we see the impact on um on the on the stock value for example I don't want to to double my inventory level just by implementing this file and what we're going to do we have this tab where you can see the Safety stock value which is quite useful to see okay but what will be the impact of my decision let's do it again because I feel it's important so you have the Safety stock I just multiply the Safety stock here in value so I multiply the Safety stock times the cost price cool so now we have this value we're going to do a pivot going to put it here up existing work sheet oh no sorry I need to select the table first existing work sheets and here we go we're going to do a XY Z and Safety stock Safety stock in value boom we're going to remove the autoit change the value [Music] USD and now we have the total value of safety talk per classification that's cool now so this is this table I just changed the layout to design I like to make it darker like this boom okay so this table is very interesting because you will see directly the impact on your safety stock based on your decision see let's say like you say no I really want to have a good uh I want to have a good um safety even for my CZ code so okay let's go back to 90% let's put 90 90 90 the Safety stock was for the C Cod was $200,000 now let's just refresh so you press F9 if you if you are in automat in manual calculation mine is automatic so it's okay and then you just refresh keep in mind $200,000 refresh okay now it's $775,000 so you increase your your by this decision you increase by $500 your the level of Safety stock and that's imp that will be an impact direct impact in your all your orders and your cash flow of your company do you have the money for that if you have the money why not if you don't have the money that's not maybe that's not a good call so I will go back to for example 80 uh 70 and 60 you can do it again and now we have 200 you could also say no I don't want to have any stock for my keep in mind if you put safety if you put 50% you will have zero Safety stock you see Zero Safety stock so this one let's say the CZ we only or order produce one the customer will ask will pay for the stock so we don't have any risk and we don't have any over stock so if I go back to this I will probably save you can already know that you're going to save $112,000 zero so you can start tuning with this uh with this and you will see that for example you have a lot of safety for this one because I guess you have a lot of products for these ones you have many products Z and that's why the decision of this parameter will have huge impact on your inventory if you move for example this one that's the one to 90 % you will reduce your inventory by $200,000 so what is the best parameter to to play you can you could also say no I want to focus on service on this one but because you have a lot of safety and products you you don't have a lot of products a and xcode I'm going to do more exercise like this in the expert level this is not rocket science you need to play and similar but you also need to understand what will be the impact on my business and on my cash flow and my recommendation is always always to start Closs from your current situation from a total level if you already at Safety stock of 2 Milli 2.2 million I will make sure that I'm not too far from 2.2 million not to have huge amount of orders or the opposite and then when you feel more confident you can start reducing and optimizing that the main difference is now before you had probably one strategy with the same strategy for all your products now your level of safety will be completely different based on the if the important in ter of volume term of profit and also in terms of level of uncertainty and you just have to check the numbers and the more you will see them the more you will be easier to to adapt so I'm going to go back to this you could also have a more service strategy this strategy will probably give you more let's check let's compare this one we have 2.2 so we have 2.5 if we go to this one let's copy and paste the value we have 2.8 so we are adding $300,000 of of inventory just the Safety stock and then we have the reaload point that we're going to talk in the next video so I hope that was clear it's it's a powerful tool you need to get used to it and you need to adapt the good way is to always track the impact and see what is the results for your company in terms of inventory but also in terms of service and you're going to track the service by checking the availability and the field rate
in this episode I'm going to talk about the reorder point so it's cool to have a safety stock with a different service Target now we need to other stock right so what we're going to do we need a REO point and the REO point I was talking about it multiple times is the Safety stock plus the average demand multiply by the lead time and the review period don't forget the review period so we're going to we are going to implement that in the Excel file CH and what is interesting is also we are going to include the safety lead time so we don't need this we're going to hide this two I don't need this one group group we have the safety we have the REO points the formula I'm going to zoom a bit more the formula we're going to have Safety stock so 1962 for this one plus the average Sal daily I was talking about the average sales before please check my Foundation level if you want to know more about the average sales the average say is here 43 we're going to use eight weeks why because it's a longer L time and I feel this is the right period because you have long early time and you also want to consider the seasonality so we go back to the formula here we are real points so we're going to use average sales daily and then what I'm going to do I'm going to multiply by the seasonality why I'm going to multiply by the cality because if I use the last eight weeks sales it would be interesting to see but okay is my the group of products in in this category is it growing or declining so that's what I was explaining in the previous module Foundation we're going to use the sionality because if you use the last four or Le eight weeks and you see that the you are for example after Christmas if you are in a retail company and you are you know that the average shes are declining it's very important to consider what is coming in the future so you have two options or you use the forecast of the next eight weeks or you use what we call the average multiply by the seasonality that's what we used in the minmax formula as well but in this case we're not using the coefficient for four weeks we're using for8 weeks why because this time we're using the the past sales for the last 8 weeks so we use this coefficient before just to explain to you again if we are here for example we're going to use we're going to divide okay what is the the weight of the next eight weeks for the this specific brand divided by the the weight of the the last eight weeks minus one and that will give you a coefficient in this specific case for example it's 18% let's take another one to make sure if it's clear for you for the seasonality and if it's not clear please go back to the seasonal It episodes before seasonality is here I think yeah so we do have the average Sage daily and the seity equs for Brand number one week 41 let's go to seasonality week 41 is this one we do have I'm going to remove that minus 35 we're going to do oh okay so we're going to divide this you can see that the weight the base and R of this weeks is much lower than this one that's why we're declining by minus 35% which is very important because you don't want to Overstock if I was only using wa this if I was only using the the average SI fast I will add way too much St that I don't need because I know that the the trend of my of this brand is to go by minus 35% the next eight weeks okay so if you don't have the seasonality you you don't necessarily need to include the seasonality but I do feel that if you have it this is something very powerful if you don't have strong variation in your company like I was working with like um maintenance products if your SE seasonality is minus or plus 10% during the every month or every week keep it simple and remove the seasonality so we're going to use the Safety stock plus average sales multiply by the seasonality then we're going to multiply by the lead time and for the lead time we have three lead time we have the lead time the average lead time that we confirmed before in the supplier tab the committed lead time and we make sure that this is relev this is the correct one that you challenge with the average lead time from your suppliers then we do have the review period it's like how often are you um making orders in this in this case it's every seven days or once a week it's very important to include this one and we do also have the safety lead time based on the last episode we're talking based on the suppliers uncertainty so in the rear the point we're going to include these three and it's very important to consider these three if you really want to cover all the risk okay so it looks comp place but it's not you just have to be very methodical and I hope it's it's clear for you right now so we do have the REO point if we go back to my slide that was the formula to have this value and once we reach this value we are going to order one EQ quantity so the EQ quantity will be this quantity on the left so once my stock is equal to Y moving a bit too fast so this is my yq is 35 quantity once I reach this quantity I'm going to raise I'm going to order one EQ if this is the time to to make the orders all right so in the next video I'm going to explain to you like before how to define the need how to run up with EQ and mq and finally out what are the the quantities you have to address to make sure you can guarantee the service for your customer we're get getting closer to the end so stay with me stay with me
in this quick video I just wanted to go back to the difference between minmax and Safety stock in Excel this time we're going to compare the two results uh why because this one is much simpler and many of you ask me id I'm not sure if I'm ready for Safety stock for uncertainty of the suppliers of the demand etc etc so this is the formula for the minmax I've done that before and this is the Safety stock plus EQ and at the end I was telling you the minmax is simpler efficient So Good Start easy to impl m one the Safety stock and EQ is using much more information demand uncertainty suppliers inventory and holding cost etc etc but it's also more complex so let's check in Excel now just for your curiosity what is the difference between these two so I just add a few columns here on the right let's make this right so you do see that we do have the re point I'd like to compare my re point uh and with my mean and my Max with my rear openon plus EQ so for the formula I use the same average size daily the same seasonality the same lead time review period and safety lead time you can already compare what's the difference between these two and I also like to compare with the max the max will be very similar between re oppon and EQ and for this one we do we we can see some significant uh difference what I was explaining to you before is the max the minan max method with a very very long Le time we'll U we'll have the we'll um multiply the average sh on the Le time and we will have an effect of multiplication that will give you more safety uh for longly time for example for the first one we have 10,000 for the Max and we only have 5,000 for this specific one that will also will explain that this one we will have much more frequent order for this item than for this one we will have a big massive big order one time and then we will uh we will wait probably for a few weeks before having to raise any new orders in in this specific one we will optimize the inventory cost and that's why this one is lower so most of the time you can see that the max is lower than is higher than this one except for the CZ uh the CZ version why because in the CZ one we don't want to have much stock we don't want to have much safety and even if the ratio is lower as well because I'm using the same formula for the ratio min max I'm using the same the same coefficient and service at the end we'll have a bit less uh safety or a very similar one for C code okay so at the end just keep in mind that minmax is simpler easy to use but you will have also more safety especially for long leak time but it's also a good start so I just wanted I wanted to show the two difference of course it will also depend on your the ratio you're going to use for for the min max if you use a fixed one or a variable one but at the end it's not too bad either and I just wanted to show you that so my conclusion is which method to to choose you could the focus is more about the data avability than the method if you have the right lead time average sales uh accuracy of your inventory this is the most important part then if you only have low volumes you could use an average mid Max method if you have like long lead time and longer volumes you can use the normal distribution method and if you don't have much with the lead time I recommend the method three for the normal distribution plus the safety uh the safety method we were using before but at the end you need to try your performance and adjust and if you don't feel comfortable with one one meod you can adjust and go back to another one
in this episode we're going to finish how many quantities we have to order and it's not only only about the EQ it's also about the mq the minimum order of quantity so we're going to combine all of this and we're going to update this file to make the magic happen Okay so let's get into it I hope you are still with me it's not that complex you just have to repeat what I'm doing we do have the REO point and after the REO Point what do we need we need to Define what is the need what is the need R up EQ and then what is the need R up M oq minimum order quantity because if your supplier say no no no no no Ed I need to have you need to order minimum 1,000 quantity you have no choice this is part of the deal okay so let's start with the need the need is very simple stock if your stock and Transit is less than the Realo point then you will order the difference between these two that's the need okay that's what you really need before any run up so don't forget for the stock I'm repeating myself but this is very important the stock is the available stock so if you have one other quantity but 80 of them are already booked for one specific customer you have 20 stocks 20 quantities of stock available not uh 100 okay so that's very important also do consider the transit the transit is very important because if you already have pending orders you don't want to multiply your orders because the stock is coming and at the end you just check the difference and the difference will give you okay my need is 4,000 quantities um because my real point is quite high right now great so I have my need then I need to run up by the EQ the economic AO qualtity what is the economic order qualtity we we've done that before so please check my videos before the idea is really to optimize the holding cost and the transaction cost and that will automatically like give you what is the best quantity to order for the most important item you will see that it's much more than one EQ it's normal because in this one for example we need a lot of quantity so you you are going to order more than one EQ but so for example if I go to a smaller one like this one you you need is 154 quantity but your EQ is 540 you need to run it by by the load size you if you want to optimize basically you want you want more quantity to optimize the the um the transaction cost so at the end your order your need EQ will be won't be 154 it will be 540 quantity so that's your need based on the EQ but also the supplier could tell you no no no no edor I need to have minimum for example for this one I need to have minimum 1,000 quantity so if you go back to item to this item we go to the supplier not the supplier tab we go to the lot and mq right so this item you can see that dmq is no that's not the one this one you you have a Lo size of 10 but you have a minimum other quantity of 1,000 1,000 quantity and that that could be a big deal for that so the minimum quality has a huge impact of your on your inventory if I go back to this um to this graph yes maybe you need to order 10 but if your supply say no no the minimum is 1,000 you have no choice or you don't order or you order 1,000 quantity and this negotiation is really important for the impact of your stock so you need to look up all this information mq into your file the base file and then if I go back to this you have the mq supplier here I have the same I have twice the same colum but you can remove one if you want and it's also interesting before going back to to how much to to how many to piece to order um to compare what is the gap between the EQ and the mq supplier it's very interesting to check that because most of the time our mq are way too high and you can also calculate the Gap in dollars for example for this one just by having a 2,500 mq you will increase the Overstock by 70 $5,000 just on one item and that would be good maybe to review the top maybe the the top the largest one for example this one is in s your EQ is 2,000 but your mq supply is 10,000 so if you need to order some stock I don't know if this is the case this is not the case but one or if you need one quantity you will have to order 10,000 10,000 quantity which is insane so I recommend you to check this value I'm going to go back to this in the expert level this is one of the main reason we have way too much talk in the in the Distribution Center especially if you have multiple multiple point of distribution centers um but please check this value I'm going a bit fast but this is I'm going to get back to this after so we do have the need and then we need to run up by mq and the the formula is quite simple if my if my need is more than zero then if my need is less than the mq you use the mq value if not you use the need of EQ okay so in this specific case my initial need was 1,000 then I R up to EQ my EQ is 1,440 then my but my mq from the suppliers is 2,500 so I have no choice than to order 2,500 quantities that's it so you see one two three three steps and then you can convert this order into value which is very important and the last step is to Define okay if this order is on not
in this episode we're going to talk about the Urgent orders and when to order and these two are related so what is the best frequency to order I was talking about it in the foundation level it really depends on on the frequency of your delivery your volume of sales and the number of item all of stock if you have a lot of volumes and you have one delivery every day or maybe every 12 hours like in the retail industry for example of course you need to review this file every day but if you have like one shipment perment from your suppliers and like very slow s you can review this file once a week or even once a month plus um checking if you have any urgent orders to to send to your suppliers as soon as possible okay so if I go back to to this uh graph you can see that if we only apply if we only apply the the real point formula say okay when I reach my real point I need to raise the order you will have to sometime you will have to raise order every every minute or every hours and it won't be good to for Global optimization if you want to fill one container if you want to optimize transport and also for you you don't want to double check every single minute so we have to be realistic and most of the company all they raise if they have short Le shortly time they're going to check every Working Day and if they have longly time they're going to raise order once a week when I was in Australia we had every Tuesday was the day to send the ERS requirement to our factories in Europe in UK and in the US so that's I would say that most of the company work this way the problem is one way is sometimes if you have if you're above your R point I was explaining that before above your R Point U for example on Tuesday you need to wait another week and you can have a shortage during multiple days because of that it's even worse if you work per month that's why I recommend to use what we call the hybrid version you have a specific time to check this file Maybe once a week but during the week you're going to check if you don't have any urgent orders to to send to your suppliers before the next Monday or the next Tuesday okay so that's what we're going to do in this file right now are you excited so we're going to build this file again this reper report starting by the Urgent orders so we do know now how many quantities we have to order we have you have the order value but it would be nice to know as well what is urgent or not so my definition of urgent is this one it's it's not it's very simple again is if my stock and plus Transit is less than my re point less safety stock then I consider that all my order is urgent I don't want to split my order into urgent and non urgent like before with the min max so I would just say like if I go back to my graph this one basically if you only have the average sales of the demand multiply by the lead time you have less than that in stock it's urgent because even if you're the right now it's already too late based on your average demon so that's the principle of my definition of urgent orders and the formula is this one stock quantity if this is less than real minor Safety stock then I would Define that all this order is defined as ENT so this one ENT I guess because there is no the stock is close to zero I guess Transit zero un stock o stock 851 and you can see that my safety 151 and this minus this no not this one up this minus this is more than um is more than 151 so we need to this order is urgent and the full order is urgent this one for example is not urgent we do need 2, 400 quantities why probably because of the Q as well you can see that the mq the need is not big we need we need only 56 then we go to EQ 330 but because of the mq we have a huge quantity to order so this one is not urgent okay so we do have the quantity to order the Urgent order I will go first if you don't have much time check what is the value the most important orders to raise are this one because this one are critical for the business and I guess most of them have zero in in stock yeah you see most of them have 0% in stock and they are all a code so this one are really really important for the business and the IDE is really to uh in a glance to see what is what is important what is urgent and make the magic happen so now we have this urgent order we're going to build this uh dashboard step by step we do have so I did the same pivot and the the foundation level so I'm not going to rebuild all of this I'm going to just do it for for the supplier and for the supplier we're going to do this so you go to the base insert pivot table range yes we want this base in existing worksheet in a new worksheet no let's do it in the in this one the P let's put it here Tran we do want to see the supplier we want to see so what do we want uncertainty stock stock okay supplier uncertainty it's good to know I want to see I will see the leete time just for my information I want to switch to compact form no tabular form no [Music] R total on row only no we don't have total yet okay then we want to have the stock in quantity and Value stock stock stock then we want to have the avability average then we want to have stock turn I've done the stock turn before I won't do it again the only thing is I think let me check the stock turn I think we move to eight weeks I'm not sure about it yeah no we use sorry we use 13 weeks so this is the same formula than the foundation level go back to this if you want to know I won't waste your time so stock turn trian treia me a Tre means a very good in French then you can learn French as well stock turn discon stuck get one course by one course get one free great when we have urgent orders in value Ur ERS in quantity okay so we do have ENT orders in quantity 12 orders and this one is going up and we do have of stock risk and I didn't explain what is out of stock risk and minimum order we're going to put this at the end what is of RIS we use the same principle than the min max report so this is this tab and in this tab we're going to say okay if my stock and my Transit is more than my real point plus safety minus Safety stock we we do zero otherwise this is the same same way than to classify what is oan no and basically if you don't have even like the the average demand multiply by the leate time this what is missing is what is uh what is the risk of of of losing sales because even if you today if you have 100 days lead time and your average is to sell one product per day and you only have 50 left you are technically you're losing 50 quantity so you are using the time to order than to wait uh because you will be out of stock 50% of the time so I'm using the same principle than the to classify aent order you can just check the formula if I'm going too fast and then I just multiply by the sales price so once again the most important for you will be to see okay what what is the most critical point and what are Myas you see that these two are very correlated you have a strong correlation between ENT orders and other of stock risk and this is the one you need to send to your suppliers and maybe do Express shipment or F rat if if it's profitable for your company so this information is very useful we go back to this we have all these suppliers and information we can now keep it clean with controll h sum of to SP to blank and same for average of R pivot tation I've done that before so if you don't if you get lost go back to my previous module Foundation I'm not going to do all the cleaning because it's already done on the other side stock turn blah blah blah you have all of this this is the same time that this one you just copy and paste the tab you can change the design like this you can change the color I've done that before and then you can add conditional formatting I've done that as well before so I won't do it again so you can see quickly in a glance what is important I always recommend to filter by agent orders first more s option orders or or orders you can Define which one is most important for you you can use orders and then you also need to see okay what is the what are the minimum orders we did the same for minmax so you're going to V look up this information VAP from the suppliers to um where is the supplier that's the one and you want to see what is the minimum order value 3 0 okay so we have this minimum order value and now a glance we can see okay what is the situation right now we need to order six 6 million 6.9 million orders are urgent we need to raise right now the risk of losing sales in sales value is 4.4 million which is a lot so in this situation we have a lot of produ that are there is a problem with the supply chain and there is no order in the system and what is also important is to see okay if if it's above or not the minimum orders so we have a conditional formatting here and this conditional formatting will just tell me if I'm below so that's the one if I'm below or above my minimum orders for this specific one Vietnam I will pay an extra fee because I'm below my minimum order maybe for for the for the supplier so we use the same principle than before the the question regarding when to order is based on this tab in this specific case you need to order as soon as possible you're going to raise all these orders you will have new Transit and then you will see okay what is my situation how many urgent orders do I have do I have left if you have a lot of urgent orders you may raise another you may also also check if you don't have if you reaching the minimum order for each supplier if you feel like okay we need we don't have that many ENT orders and it will be way too expensive with the minimum orders from your suppliers you can wait or you can do maybe specific F rate for very specific products don't do it for all your products you're going to kill your your profit and the planet but the best way to balance okay what is the best time to do it is to play with this tab and to see what is the situation for that and if I can wait that was the the hybrid version I was talking about before sometime it will be maybe once a week or once a month but some you're going to check what is the volume of urgent orders and when this volume of ERS is too important for the business and you have a lot of sales to to lose then you can raise specific orders for for every single suppliers okay so the more you will play with this file the more you will get it and this is very useful to have all this information into one Tab and all these parameters and then you can see what is the situation for example Italy is not great but you don't have many products you you have in a glance the performance of every single supplier obviously like if you are from China you don't expect the same stock turn that if you are from Romania or or because this specific company has a lot of activities in in Europe so that's it for this video I hope this is clear in the next one we're going to finish the dashboard and I'm going to tell you more about optimization
in this episode we're going to talk about the dashboard how to create the dashboard and how to update the dashboard okay so most of this design and graph I've done all of it in the previous module Foundation how to create the dashboard so I want do avability all of this is exactly the same I just add a new segment XY Z we use all these pivot from the same base and we create P pivot graph based on this pivot table so same principle please go back to the other one before top 10 Stock top 10 sales this is the same we buil the supply report in the previous video so just check the this is what the one we built um we built just before now what is missing is just the other item report we can do it quickly if you want but it's quite simple or to V you don't you don't really need it you can also use directly this base but you just create a pivot table like this in an existing worksheet like this one okay and then you just create your item code name I put all the information because I don't want to you already know how to do that right you can add the Safety stock if you want to see the Safety stock the real point and then the other quantity other value ENT and the risk of risk okay so then you go to that J tabular form and you have all this information and then you can copy and paste into this one you know you just can have alate if the stock is zero and you can just drill down by all of stock risk this see how much money you're going to lose in terms of sales price and this is all the items you need to to send to your customer right you can value filter also greater than zero for the order quantity then you only see the items you have to order so in a glance you can see quickly what is the situation right now okay so you have all this uh pivot table you can add the segment by having the segment is the same you go to insert slicer and you just set for example XY Z boom and then don't forget to report the connection and connect to all the pivot table you want to change in this one okay so I'm going to remove this because we don't need it but that's how you build the dashboard and please go back to the previous module if you want to do that now how to update this file it's very simple as well you need just need to update the price tab the sales tab leave this one like this you just copy and paste from your e extraction the stock the transit the lot you don't have to do that every every day and the P orders if you want to track the lead time of your supplier so what is important is mostly to to update the sales the stock and the transit the lot M past orders this one you only use it when you want to to to update your the lead your average lead time so you can do it maybe one per quarter or one per months and the price you can do it as often as you have a new price in the system also don't forget to add new item at the end if you have new items coming don't forget to make sure that they are all in the in this file and The Bu with ses and stock if you don't you don't have any item missing that's something very important as well and then when everything is ready you go to data refresh all and everything will update I didn't change the sales but you will go to 42 if you have if you have the new sales for the week 40 42 okay so that's it for the refresh the second option is to have a macro once again to copy and paste or use power query I'm going to use power query in the expert module and I'm going to also to create a bonus for you with the the same version of this file but this time using Pro query to update and to connect directly this file to external data that you don't have to copy and paste directly so you will have data with past order sales sales year for last year and this year etc etc so I'm going to do a specific bonus it's not mandatory to get the certificate but I feel it's important for you and if you want to go much deeper I have an Excel course called SM SM Excel expert and I will share with you all the secrets to become an expert as well with Excel so that's it for the the update I see you for another episode
in this video we're going to talk about analysis how to analyze this dashboard and also how to optimize the parameters so it's it's perfect to have this dashboard to see okay what is my situation right now avability discon stock my stock turn so I can see quickly what are my priorities I will focus first on the avability of my aod for sure then I will also focus on my top stock to see okay what is the situation to improve that especially like this one the discon stock what is the action plan for that I'm going to do a lot of analysis and action plan in the expert module so I don't want to spend too much time on it please check the the next expert module what is missing in this report is I would I would love to see more like historic for my availability and all this metric so we're going to do more in the the experts module you will see okay what was what is the cell projection what is the inventory projection and also what is the evolution of my availability and if you really want to go to the next level uh you should follow my essay metric course and I do a lot of dashboard and Metric much deeper one we're going to talk about forecast accuracy etc etc with maps and and stuff like this so this is not the goal of this episode but the more you will have visuals and curve the more it will be easier for you to understand the situation and then to go from macro level to micro level and the micro level is always the same you start from this okay my ab my a a code avability is not great I go to my Base Great what's going on and you can see quickly in the glance what is the situation and this is the process with my team and what is action plan for that for for for all these products there is no transit in the system so we need to raise these orders as soon as possible yeah we do have some Transit but it's not enough so we need to raise more orders otherwise we're going to lose this value this amount of cash we're going to lose half million dollars if you if you don't have this stock as fast as possible okay so that's that is for that we do this you do the same for the stock the the the biggest stock with the the biggest stock turn and then the next question is okay but how do we implement this file and what will be the the risk for the cash flow and how to adjust the parameters I always recommend to check okay what is the first time you use this file what will be the impact on your stock in this specific one if you raise all the others 7 millions and your total stock is 16 million which is a lot to be honest this is a lot you're going to divide this by this so you have 42 you're going to increase your stock by you can increase your by 42% which is a lot so maybe you don't want to increase by 42% or in in this case we have a lot of all of stock so I feel that this is important but what you can do you could also you could start with one supplier to see what is the result you can also compare what are the biggest order versus today so in this specific situation to be honest this company had a lot of issue with service and they had some problem with the team and and that's just one example but uh basically they didn't raise order for a while so this the situation was not great but if you don't know I will start with the biggest order in value and I will start checking okay if if makes sense for you or not if it makes sense for you what is the real open where is the Safety stock and what what is what are also the the average sales per day and you can also change check all of these you have a very very long Le time 120 days and you are selling like if you 120 divided by like I'm I'm tired today 12 divid by 7 is 17 so you have like you sell like for example the last 26 weeks 4,800 quantities you have a very longly time your safety stock is only 1,000 and your REO point is higher but that's an EOD and you have a lot of uncertainty so having like something like six months doesn't it's not crazy you know like when you see when you sell this is the quantity you sell in uh in six months having the same level for real point for me makes sense but if you feel that this is this is too much you could start slowly and say no no I'm going to go back to my XY Z and I'm going to keep it lower the beginning I'm going to go from for example I'm going to start at 90 92 91 90 and I'm going to reduce as well this one to 88 87 CU keep in mind this is not the service of the availability you're going to get in your in your Warehouse or store or factory and this one I'm going to keep it simple so you can reduce all of this and see what is the impact to start slowly you can also stop not have any safety St for you SEC and then you can see what is the impact for this so you can reduce by 1.1 million and what is the impact for the total I know you move well you move to you reduce by one M it still 39% of your total stock so you can do it like this you can also do it per per supplier but in this specific case they need to to raise a lot of orders so it's by adjustment that you will really figure out okay what what are the best value what are also the RM of stock turn and avability but in this specific case I do feel like the stock turn will probably increase and the avability also will increase a lot because they're losing a lot of money I I do feel they can go to 92 or 93% service easily uh because they have a lot of L of stock and risk for for that if I go back to the minan max you you can do the same and you can always check what is impact if you check the minan max method before this time it's only 1% the total orders is only 1.2% so there is not a huge impact you could even like if you feel you need more avability I will be more bullish on the the ratio M Max of the saag say okay let's go to 98% for this one and see what is the impact for that so the total order is 211 let's refresh and know you increase by $20,000 okay you understand so it's not a big impact so if you feel you have the cash flow for that this is how you're going to adjust and then you're going to you're going to check item by item always take the biggest value in orders uh to check if it's relevant and do this micro analysis and micro analysis and if you have any questions please send us a question regarding this file and you also have like a private consultation if you if you have the the private consultation with me and we can talk about how to optimize your your file we're going to talk more about this optimization in the expert level
all right now we're ready for the expert level I'm very excited now you have all the foundation and the professional level in this module is it's a multiple model I'm going to share with you a real Consulting example and how I reduced the inventory by 21% in a six months so it's I divided my structure into 45 steps that you will you will love I'm sure and I'm going to go step by step the IDE is really really to apply what everything we learned before in another example and yes sometimes I'm going to repeat myself why because we repetition is key in Supply CH and especially Inventory management we have to be consistent so it's important to repeat the same task to make sure where we are always optimizing uh the inventory and we are always very careful of the balance between inventory level and the service for the customers okay so we're going to apply all of this and the idea like this uh this company so I'm not going to give the name of this company but this is a big company with like something like 80 $80 million of inventory value and this company has a huge warehouse and this Warehouse is supplying a distribution Network like in a in a specific country okay so this company has a big network of something like Sol sites that they they're going to supply we're going to focus mainly on the inventory optimization of the main DC on the main distribution centers and then we're going to also talk about multi levels and multi Echelon levels later what is really important in in this specific example if it was a factory it would be the same what what the the only difference would be like we will switch uh products to components okay so you can apply this uh methodology whatever you are working with a factory with a DC with a retail store we are we are using exactly the same principle you may switch maybe quantity by volumes but that's the only difference you may switch also something very important it's okay we're talking about 1880 Millions um USD of inventory but if you have only 80,000 USD where this is the same methodology you don't have difference because you have 200 millions or because you have like $10,000 of inventory as well the only main difference will be if you have multiple side but in this one we're going to focus mainly on this distribution centers with long lead time and what you will have to adjust is maybe the the lead time of your suppliers etc etc all right so now I'm going to show you the Excel and the Excel is pretty cool uh you like it so we we had the foundation the pro and the EXP I'm using the same structure so I'm not going to I'm going to go much faster if you directly jump into the X level uh be careful because sometimes I'm going to go much faster all right so what do we have in this file we have a dashboard a quite similar dashboard but this time we can see that we do have sales projection we do have inventory projection we I'm going to get back to this we have different suppliers from different countries with the top 50 orders that we're going to go back to this as well and we have also what so the main difference for me the main difference with this one is we have this tab called 45 steps and what we're going to do is we're going to go step by step and I'm going to explain to you what as a consultant or you can as a supply manager or as a supply project manager what you should do step by step from file creation to Capi analysis and defining your priorities to uh other cleansing inventory management parameters to demand and forecast to procurement and supply ERS to logistic and distribution EIP and software and also communication okay are you going to communicate your action plan to your company or to your clients okay so this is I'm going to go step by step and we're going to check all the box one by one yes one by one like this and the idea is really to show you all the steps uh to really improve your the performance of your suppli so we have this 45 step that's just this tab is uh has a lot of value CU it took me like it's like it's a 15 years summary into one time and that will give you a lot of ideas to okay what what are all my what are all my possibilities to optimize my inventory some of them are applicable for you some of them not but it's okay you don't have to apply all of them to improve your your inventory and your service and your cash flow especially if you have a company and if you're in a critical position as well okay what is also important you can see the gain if it's a shorten shortterm midterm or long-term game as well so if you if you are really in trouble you can really focus on the shortterm one I'm going to get back to this list after then we do have the dashboard we have seasonality we have a new tool to review to help you to review your forecast that's a new bonus for all the the the members of ABC Supply Chain so it it will really help help you to say okay should I review or reduce my my current forecast if you do have a forecast if you don't have a forecast you can get inspiration from that we're going to talk about the XY Z analysis but this time we are going to use the forecast accuracy for that so in my previous module I was talking about how to classify your product based on the like what we call demand or sales deviation this time we're going to use the forecast accuracy and multiple tools and tabs that we're going to use we have more more details for fee orders plan orders we have different suppliers as well and yes we're going to do again Safety stock methods and multiple multiple way to optimize your inventory again okay okay so this is just a quick overview we're going to get back to this slowly but surely and also something important in this uh Excel file I'm using powerquery to refresh my tab so this is not mandatory to use powerquery in the next video I'm going to talk about okay how do how did I set up this file and also aut to fix this because you should you should have an error like this if you go to data and Career Connection you should have a problem like this so I'm going to explain to you why I use po query why it's much easier and faster but if you if you if you feel like this is way too complex for you you can you don't have to use it the most important is to understand the different steps that you can apply in your company and if you feel really you can also include power query but this is not mandatory to get certified uh Inventory management expert so I hope you're excited download this file and I see you for the next video
okay so let's start in this um checklist we're going to go step by step and this is my bread into this checklist uh to optimize your inventory and your service okay we're going to we have many of them some of them are obvious for you some of them may be like new for you you don't have to apply all of them but I really want you to see exactly what I'm doing and then you can repeat with your company or with your clients so the first step is okay if your Excel is too slow I feel this is something very important sometimes like you open this file and you feel like it's like it takes forever just to open or to to move to another table to calculate the formula so the first thing I recommend is to avoid to have like 10 Excel spreadsheet open in the same time okay so I don't have that but if you have like for example the pro and Foundation level and it's too slow just close as many file as you want it's like you need to have a clean desk when you start working okay the second one is you can also disable the automatic calculation uh for example so if you feel like it's getting slow to calculate you go to that you go to formula calculation option and you can switch to manual and then if I for example I this two you you see there is no calculation then you if you press F9 key it's going to recalculate okay so if you feel this is very slow or you are building a huge file with too much data for like when I was working with big companies I was always in manual mode and I was pressing F9 when I wanted to recalculate the full spreadsheet you can also press shift F9 if you you want to recalculate on this tab and if you save you're going to recalculate as well all right so that's my recommendation I'm going to switch back to automatic if you don't need that also something that is really really slow is if you have like any external link okay if you go to data and if you go to Links here if you have external links to other files that could be something that will really slow down your file so I do not recommend to have external links I will recommend to use powerquery we're going to talk about this later then you need to to limit the complex formulas such as Su if sum if every formula with sum count if these formulas are really really like energy and calculation consuming so I do not recommend to like have a full Excel file full of su formulas for example so be careful with that you have multiple option I recommend always to use the the pivot table to uh for these kind of formulas also something that can be quite slow for your file is uh to you if if you use too much what we call conditional formatting so this is a conditional formatting if you check this if you go to home manag you can see that if there is X then it's green just I like to have this visualization but also in the dash in the base I'm using quite a lot of conditional formatting if you feel like you it's getting super super slow for you not in the new if you have the latest Excel version I don't think it's going to be a problem but for the 2013 or even 16 sometimes it can be very slow so if you want to to remove the conditional formatting I don't I do not recommend but you can select and clear not not the entire shet but from the selected sales okay so that's the that's my recommendation then you can use power query if your file is too slow maybe you have 10 20 30 40,000 items and I feel like this is maybe the moment for you to learn how to use power Cy so we're going to I'm going to explain to you how do I use it to to refresh this file this is not mandatory this is optional but I feel that this is important to share this tool especially if you have a lot of data and you want to go much faster to refresh and update your file so we're going to check this one now and that's the principle of this uh episode is really to go step by step and in the next one we're going to talk about how to get the data how to consolidate and also how to use Pro query with one specific example
Next Step second step we need to get the data right so data is key and many many of you want to ask you for your goals okay what is your main difficulty today they say ah I can't get my data it's not easy to get it from it from e but this is there is no shocker you need to have at least basic data if you want to optimize your inventory please check my previous module I was I think it was in the foundation module I was talking how do I get data how do I find the right person and how do I give chocolate C and baget for this person to to have my to have access to this right so in this one I'm going to just introduce you all the data we we're going to use and this is it should be one of your it should be your first step you need to be very clear what do you need before building this file and all this analysis behind that okay so it's going to be very similar to the professional Foundation level so I'm going to go fast and in the next one I'm going to talk about data consolidation I'm going to explain to you also how to use powerquery to get this faster so the first step is you need to have the item list right so we in this file we do have something like 3,000 item something like that yeah we do have yeah 2,800 items so this is the same I like to have different colors for different group of data you need to have the item code correct you need to have the itm the brands the different categories if you want to play with seasonality and also for your different analysis also something that is not in this file you you could also have one column with the demand for example if you have a demand planning team you should have one you could have one colum with your demand planning the responsible of each perameters then you can you can focus on the the performance per demon planner but for me it will be like okay each demon planner has one brand and we're going to focus on uh one brand by brand all right so we do have the item list that's something you you need to have a very clear process each time you have a new product from from Mark from marketing from the sales team it's very important to have a very very clear process I like to use Google form or this kind of form that you need to go through a process with different steps and responsibilities to make sure that you don't miss anything so same for item RS and family then we need to have the the item St article stue item stue we I was talking about this one in my previous um in the foundation level so I'm not going to to spend way too much time on that but it's important to have this information if you want to identify your obsolete stock and disc continous stock so we need to have this information you can do it manually or you can just link from a tab from your Erp cool so we have this I'm going to go a bit fast but this is this is also good like if you if you don't know exactly what you say you just say okay this is what I need and then uh and then you just have you go to your shopping list with it for example then we do need stock value so for the stock if you go back to my file so if you go to download my file you will have all this information right and you can see that there is one called stock so let's open it so in this one what do we have we have the item code the item name the item St the saf so we're going to use the Safety stock later this is the Safety stock from the Erp we have the total stock we have the warehouse stock and we have different sites we have 30 39 sites that we can use later but the most important first is the the stock from the warehouse that we want to optimize so we do have it in quantity great good job and also you want to it in value for that you can combine with the if you don't have the value directly you can multiply by the price and the price is something like here all right so we we we're going to check this this I'm going to zoom a bit more for you perfect here we go no great uh the stock per side Warehouse Factory if you have multiple stores so we do have it as well in the same file then we have the stock T value we're going to use the stock TCH value for inventory accuracy and this is very simple it's just okay one one picture of your stock at a specific time for every so we only have it for the warehouse so we have it I'm going to explain to you later how to calculate it great then we do have the S quantity per week or per month uh we have a same similar format I do recommend to have a vertical format let's open this file so in this file we have the item code all the categories you don't necessarily need all of this but I feel it's at least important to have the item code the period you can also create like like one member ask me okay how do you create this 20201 you can concatenate so we can do here and this something like this and this boom okay and you you just concatenate and you will have this format I like this format because then you can you can [Music] sort when you do like this you can sort in ascending descending because if you have only year and week it's not easy to to ascend or you need to to sort multiple columns in the same time okay so it's a bit more technical so I'm going a bit F but it's okay you have the wig the sales quantity we have the sales price the sales in value and the demand we're going to use the demon as well for the fiar rates so we have everything we need that's amazing if you don't have the demon it's okay uh you don't need necessarily to have the demand it's not easy to get the demand the difference between sales and demand is okay your company has one customer ask you 10,000 and you could only Supply 8,000 so the the difference between these two will give you the fiar rate and it's it could be very useful as well to always Bas your models on your demand if you uh if you have this information but this is not mandatory if you don't have it okay so we have we have this we have this we have the demand quantity this is optional we have the sales the sales value cost we do have this the margin do we have the margin I think it's based on the price we have a price set for that yes we do have the margin this is the difference between the sales price and the cost price great then we're looking for the four years sales history uh or demand is if you have the demand history for to calculate the seasonality for this one we have something called Sales brand seasonality so you could have it per item if you have it per item it's even better but sometimes it's way too much data so if you don't have four years history per item per week or per month if you work per months uh it's okay in this specific one we only have like the the year the brand and the sales in value so that will be very useful then to calculate the seasonality later uh and the more you have a history the more it's useful so you I would recommend at least two years if you have can have two years but it's better if you have four or five years okay especially with the if you had like um specific events that that you cannot use because of the pandemic or because of like I don't know crisis or huge shortage for six months and you can really use this data for seasonality I'm going to get back to this slowly all right so I'm going to close this sales don't save great so we do have this the sales forecast per quantity per item so it's useful as well if you have the forecast already we're going to use the forecast and we're going to challenge the current forecast in the system and we also do have it in value I'm going to get back to this but at least it's good to have if you have the forecast to have it per with the per name in quantity great not going to save then you you need to have all what we call everything related to supply suppliers and uh Inventory management so we need to have the supplier per item the lead times the minimum order quality and also all the pending orders regarding like what is coming to the to the warehouse or to the factory so we have all of this if we go to suppliers we do have the item code the mq quantity minimum order quantity we're going to challenge this quantities the suppliers and the country of the suppliers we have this so that's perfect then we do have the supplier lead times the supplyer lead times is directly in the file we go to suppliers here there we go so we have the suppliers with the the lead time the total lead time and also the review period we're going to get back to this great 45 steps it's not clearly it's the boring part of it but once you you get it it's much easier to and much faster to go so I think it's important to get back to this list first the mq we're talking about it before the current F FM orders and plan orders what's the difference between these two the F orders are already like confirmed and I would guess confirmed by suppliers this is a commitment and they most of the time they're already shipped and you can basically you cannot canel them I mean you can try but it's much much more complex and the plan ones I just it's a forecast or it's a like a projection okay what what will be the the need and what do we have to adate it's before uh it's before the Le the minimum lead time so for example you have a 10 days lead time and you need you may need to order like next month in like 40 days you can already have a projection okay I will probably order these quantities and that can be very useful for you and for your suppliers to to have a projection okay what will be the the need uh after the lead time just to anticipate the production the components etc etc so we have the fee orders already in the system and the plan ones are the forecast that you want to plan so if you don't have this it's okay but most of the big companies have two separate categories current F models is the transit what what we are talking about in the professional level and plan is what we plan to buy then we do have we need the cost price per item we already have it in the pricing tab so I can check that and also something useful it's good to if you have any parameters from your system like uh coverage minmax real point of Safety stock so I think we have this for example in this one I think it's always good to to extract your data from your Erp and to challenge them with Excel if you can so I always like to see okay what was the real point value or what what was the Safety stock value in the in the in the European going to recalculate in Excel and then we're going to compare what what is the main gap between what is in the system and what is the new calculation from this Excel file all right so I just just to give you ideas and inspiration okay get all this information you can for anything related to inventory management could be minmax it could be rear point or it could be Safety stock I do not have minmax in this one I have a safety stock value but it's important to have all this information ready in different types first and in the next video we're going to combine this into one file and I'm going to also explain how to refresh automatically with uh Excel it's very important that you have this as standard as possible don't try to change the format of this it should be like directly from your Erp or ioning system it's better to have it as simple because then if you if you every Monday or every day if you have to change the anything in this file then to apply in your file will be much much more complex so keep it as standard as possible I do like the vertical way for stocks for DC is not the best way to get information is better if you had one row per site you it would be it would be better to have here like the site number and for one row you will have only one information like we like we have for sales I'm going to show you that to only have one row with one item one parion and one one cap one cap in this case it's sales quantity for example uh and then because in terms of pivot T will be much much easier to to use and to to play with okay so that one the the introduction how to First you need to have all these data most of them are optionals but you need to have sales stock uh price uh Transit and information from your suppliers uh to uh to have the right foundation to start
in this video we are going to talk about data consolidation so it's very important to understand that okay you need to have the data first from this multiple file and then you need to consolidate into one uh one single file one single Source because most of the company they don't have access uh to this information quickly and that's why it's very very difficult to take to take action and decision because you need to check or it could be an Excel or in your EIP system okay what is the stock what is the supply information what is the sales and having everything to one like we did before is very very efficient in terms of decision making so you have two ways to do it we have the classic way I'm going to go back to my steps in this in this episode I'm going to talk about the classic way which is very similar to the Prof professional Foundation level or or you have the automatic way with power query this is very important this is nonmandatory to master query I've said I've said that before the most important for me is that you understand the multiple steps to optimize your inventory this is not an ex full Excel course of course you can repeat what I'm doing but it's okay if you get if you get lost in my next episode you can use this file without ref refreshing all this data and you can use the classic way from professional Foundation level but I just want to go to go a bit further to go to the next step and if you feel ready now or maybe in six months it's okay you can also follow I have an Excel full Excel course in and in this course I'm going to explain to you how to become an expert with Excel as well okay so the first step is to move all the that into one single file so as the for example the foundation level in the foundation level I was just saying okay just copy and paste your sales your price your stock your Transit your late time so basically you just do the same with all this information one tab one uh one data all right so you do that and then you need to centralize all your data into one one base so what you're going to do is like before you you have your items information then you have your your price I'm not going to repeat all these formulas this is just a v up uh you can add if error formula for example for this one if there is no stock I put zero we do have stocks for the W and we also have stock for the the network uh this is the Ware stock and this is the side stock here I'm going to get back to this for inventory distribution we do have the same the sales you can use the classic the classic way like we did before I'm not going to repeat that from the foundation level we have the tab with the sales and then we do a pivot table and we get the last the last week sale with like four weeks eight weeks 13 weeks etc etc all right perfect we do we are going to go back to Capi we get the no sorry this is the expert level we're going to do the same with the the forecast uh you get the forast and we do when we do the same you have the forecast here and we did a forecast pivot exactly like the sales to have the four weeks 13 weeks 26 and 52 weeks if I'm going too fast go back to the foundation level I just did a pivot table from forecast here and I just uh sort descending to have my my latest period on the left to have okay what are the forecast coming all right cool so you have your forecast and you just V look up with your forecast I'm going to get back to this what is that I'm going to go back to all these capis and we have the same for the orders I'm going to get back how to use these orders but we do have FM orders and plan orders on the right so we have all these orders you just copy and paste from orders I guess so we have F orders and we have plan orders so it's just a copy and paste or you can use powerquery if you want to do it automatically after but this is the same Tab and then we have formulas on the right same for this one just one very important thing if you want each time you you when you want to copy information I always recommend to convert into tab mode so I've SE that before but it's very important you have this tab when you copy and paste you go insert table and boom it's always much easier and efficient and everything to have it in a table format because it's easy to read and it's cleaner and when you have more information at the at the bottom it's much more efficient to to use as well okay so always use the what we call the table format this is something very useful cool so we do have all this information I go back to my tab to my base we have the mq information from the suppliers we have the suppliers information from the item code delete time and this is the same than the the professional level but I'm going I'm going to go back to all these formulas uh after and we have some action plan in this uh specific tab okay so not a big deal you copy and paste one tab one information and in my next video I'm going to because in this specific one I'm using powerquery because I can refresh I I don't even have to copy and paste but this is not mon to get certified Inventory management expert okay to finish if I go back to the 45 steps you can see that you have all item with stock orders and forecast so this is very important when you consolidate in this base that you don't forget items and many companies they don't have all 100% of the items in this in this list so what I'm talking about is for example when we say okay I need to have all my item with stock you go back to this file and maybe once a month you do a vup video cap of this item in this specific one we all have the item number into number format so it's not text format just to let you know if you try to use because from my professional Foundation it was text format so be careful with that if you have a problem is your VAP and we just do a vup like this one boom right all right and it's it's good to know if you have any okay we do have one item missing you can see that this one all right so this one is a new code but is like yeah it's part of my exraction I don't have any stock so you you could say okay that's a new one so what you could do is you go back to this one and you you can add this item code at the end of your list probably you will have some stock coming so this is a good example by inserting this new file you see like with the table format it's much faster to duplicate the formulas you can add the name etc etc so that's a safety check you should do with your base I don't have the brand for this one so I will have to look for the the brand but you should have this V up check with your stock with your anything related to fil orders plan orders and also if you have any forecast so I'm not going to do for you can do the same for the vup for Fus but that's a safety check that you should do once a week or you should you can have also a pivot table and you should you could display only the how many items are missing every every week to make sure that you don't miss any items in this tab so that was that was a safety check that is very very important and also I always recommend when you data consolidate in your base to always filter down by stock value or for example from the warehouse or by sales okay so it's always good to see okay what is my top my largest boom what is my biggest inventory in the in the warehouse and that's that's the way you can really focus on the most important you could do this in sales or in in stock I'm going to go back to analysis just after okay so that's it for the the consolidation in the next one we are going to talk about power query but you don't need to master that that's optional and then we're going to talk about data cleansing and the p
in this episode we're going to talk about how to refresh and connect your data automatically with powerquery this is not monitary so you can click below the video if you don't want to see that but I recommend that you see that because this is pretty cool so how to use Pary to automatically update and extract your data the problem with the current solution for example from professional is you need to copy and paste manually you can do manual error and uh it's not it's efficient but it's not super efficient and what I like is to have everything into one folder with all of my data and just press press refresh and my file is going to read I have access to the information is not going to upload and have also all the the the quantity and the volume of this information in my file so my file will be much faster much easier to update and also you can Al you can also include some data cleansing automatically uh I have a specific bonus for that if you click the bonuses after this module okay so what what is important you can also see that we have a we have a problem with this file that that we're going to fix so first of all I'm going to give you one example with sales or to up how to integrate sales directly in this file without copying and paste and then I'm going to explain to you how to fix this file in a very simple way okay so let's go back to one specific example you can see in my file like I have the sales pivot but I don't have the sales tab if you go back to the professional level I do have a sales tab tab okay I copy and paste my sales and then I have the what we call the XY Z pivot table on the right okay but in the Pro in the expert module where is my Sal tab I don't have Sal Tab and why what is happening if I go to insert I'm going to go insert pivot table you can see you can go from table run you can go from external data source and what I've done is I choose one of these connection and I create a pivot table from one of this connection in this case it will be the sales tab directly and that's what we're going to do you don't need you don't need even have to have the the sales tab in your file so we're going to go do it for sales and then I'm going to explain to you how to fix that so what we're going to do we're going to create a new file blank please do it with me okay then what we're going to do and that's powerquery so if you don't have access to powerquery is because you have your Exel is less than 2016 or you using a Macbook so if you're using an Excel 2013 you can Google we're going to put the link below the video as well but you can download a plugin to install power query in your in your in your Excel version for 207 and 10 and if you're using a Macbook there is no Pro with Macbook so I recommend use W you install Windows in your MacBook like I did before and I explain in my introduction module okay so now what is for it's very simple much simpler than macro and you go to get data from file from Excel or workbook or text CSV if you have a CSV file for example or you can go directly from a folder if you have multiple file so let's go to excel workbook and you go to data expert and let's take this sales tab perfect cool so you have two sheets you see I want to go for the first one and you always click on transform data great and in this specific example you can see all my tab and you can see on the right if you check my bonus on for query you can see that you already it's like a micro okay this is the source this is the navigation you don't need to understand all of this I really this is not an Excel course I just want you to explain how to update data automatically that's it so you can see you all of this something very important sometime if you for example your you want to have a text format of your code you will need to click to text and it will automatically uh replace it will you will convert this automatically you don't have to do it manually after in Excel but let's go back to whole number replace current just replace current so you have this tab okay and the the easi thing you can do is just go to close and load on the left load two and you have multiple option you can go to table pivot table pivot chart etc etc and that's amazing why because you can create directly in this file a pivot table without having to without having to load all the data in your file so your file will be much lighter so let's go first to table to show you the difference you can see on the right 50 is loading all my information boom so now in this file I have my sales this is the exact same structure than my sales file okay so I have my sales here and this is what I got here okay so this is the same sales and sales if you want to refresh you can go right click refresh so if you change anything in your sales tab is is is updating again okay so for example if I change this to 9 don't forget to save I go back okay because it's already connected so it won't work but that that's the idea I would have to close first but then you just have to refresh you can go from this way or you can refresh all if you have multiple order you can refresh all here okay so he's going to refresh and load that's the first step cool so now you refresh this but you don't really want this because this file is quite heavy like you you will have the same size like two 12 Mega I don't want to have 12 Mega let's save this file to see what is the weight of this file F save test let's create test so my file test is like 10 mega almost the same size okay almost the same because I have a table format it's a bit lighter so now what I want to do is say no I don't want to have this tab I want to have directly my pivot table what I did in my exper file so what we're going to do we're going to go back to this you right click on this if you don't see that you go to data CER connection boom and you can see like ex that's load two and this time I want a pivot table report you click okay okay I'm going to lose my table and now you see I don't have any data but I can already like I can do pivot table of my sales what are my sales CH per week for here that's amazing you see so I know let's save this file again boom I know you can see that my file is now 2 Mega so you see I only have to copy and paste anything and this one is empty I just have a connection with 150,000 rows and I have my privot table directly and that's what I've done in the expert level you can see that there is no Sal step there is only a pivot table to have this structure we can we could do it now so what do we want we want to have the week on the this side then we want to have the period T we want to have the sales quantity I want to have every single item code okay and we want this descending so this is exactly what I've done without having to upload anything else or to copy and paste my tab so it's much faster uh to have this than to copy and paste then to the pivot table and you will multiply you multiply by 3 four five the size of your file and will be much longer to update so that's that was the principle of um of the the PO query so what we're going to do not to give you an ex ex you're going to I'm going to ask you to do the same for let's what we can do we can do it for stock for example so let's do it for no let's do it for let me check what would be nice St for some of them you can only like for example let's do it for price so you can pause this video and try to update price you don't need to do any pivot table I just want to see the table and then we're going to do it together okay great so let's do it now I'm very proud of you because you done it let's go to uh insert get data file price you you get this tab transform data CH you have this price perfect you can check if you agree with the the information and then you just do close load and [Music] two new worksheet yes and this time we don't want to pever we want the table boom that's it so now you have the sales and the price great so now it's working perfectly and you you could do it this is what I've done for all my tab I've done I have uploaded sometime I just get a pivot table sometimes I have the like for example for the forecast I have the forecast on the left and then I have the Su here I did the same for fi rate I will go back to fi rate after no worries I did the same for FM ERS for plan orders suppliers I just copy and paste because it's it was only was a manual operation forq you can see theq and the stock Tech I think was a manual operation because I don't want to update my stock Tech every single day as well okay so this is what I've done that's instead of copying and paste I'm using power query and it's much faster and easy to refresh and when you want to refresh and you have multiple table you go to data you go to refresh all and it's going to refresh everything automatically in a very safe uh way now what we're going to do in the next video optional as well I'm going to we're going to fix this file and we're going to I'm going to explain to you what's going what's happening why you have this you have this because the link you see you have the link from my laptop but what is important is you need to change the link to your laptop or you could be a share a share folder from your company so that's what we're going to do in the next video but I hope you get a you get um the the main point of why it's so convenient and easy to use for query
in this video we're going to fix this file because this file is broken yes I'm giving you broken files and you don't deserve that okay so uh I I was saying before that we are using a power query to update this file if you don't see that you go to home data and you go to query and connection and you can see that you cannot really refresh uh because we need this file is coming from my laptop and you need we need to change the location location of this file in your laptop so first of all you have to make sure you download uh this data expert with the file make sure that they are in a place that you you are not going to move this folder often it's also very important that you don't change any of the the folder above your the folder where you have the data otherwise you will have to do this operation again and again and now what we're going to do we're going to fix this file because you can if you go to data and refresh all it won't work because of that you can see like in this um o data source error oh my goodness data source error so what we're going to do we're going to refresh this is not mandatory you could work with this file just see how it works and then not use powerquery if you don't want to use powerquery you can just copy and paste I was explaining that before but I feel this is important even if you don't understand power Cy to be able to update the source then you can refresh this this file as well so what we're going to do you going to go to current connection you go to double click on this one great and this is all you don't have to understand all of this but this is all my connection and you have data source error what you can do directly you go to data source settings here on the right and you can change directly the source of this file that's it so you need to change the source for avability availability you go to brow and you select you make sure you go to the right folder and you select okay and you can see now my avilability on the left is okay you can see there is no more error so you do the same for all of them make sure you you pick the right file for C great Focus mq supplier change Source you can accelerate this video or do it with me you just have to do it once and make sure you yeah it's a share like if you in your company it's a share folder it's it's a very clear name okay that data exraction I do not recommend to have as well any um like date or period on your file you will be like Focus accuracy not focus accuracy a year or month 11 or October that's not something I recommend orders and the price the forecast accuracy is not yet then we have the Sayes say stuck and the Sales brand Sales brand what is the sales brand Focus okay close let's see what is the SW you can click here as well say boom okay I'm not really using this one I feel yeah I'm going to clean that later okay so perfect you have all of this I feel I'm going to remove Sales brand because it's not part of it and now what we have we have everything ready what we can we can close and load like this up and it's going to load everything again and basically your file will be updated after that let's see so it takes a while the first time because this is the first time he's creating the connection it will be much faster the next time avability and now we're good we have this file is up to date and is link there is no more error and now you can uh you can work directly and update the file if you want to update the file one more time you just click to refresh and it's going to refresh everything again each time you for example copy and paste one of this file to refresh price stock sales etc etc so this is much faster you just have to be very careful for example if you change I'm not sure it's going to work but if you change the price the name of this file to 01 and you want you try to refresh prices refresh it's going to fail why because you change the name of the file okay so you have to be very careful with the name also very care be very careful with the name of this tab if you change prices to sheet one or whatever it won't work and you have to be very careful so we're going to remove that to price let's see how it works refresh o no it's working and uh also you have to be very careful with all the names of all the folders below so if you change the name of the folder data exper to data data you will have to re-update all the source of all these files so make sure of that and make sure it's very clear for all the your team members so you have multiple errors if you want to go further I have a full online course ex Excel expert to become an expert with Excel but I do feel that there was the necessary in intro to really understand what is the potential of uh how to refresh your file and also you can know directly create if you go to insert you can create pivot table directly from external data source you can choose a connection to say Okay I want to have I want to have the the price you can open create a new tab and you will be able to create a pivot table directly from that for example I want to have my average cost price for my item the average cost price is 93 $93 okay so you don't need to you don't need to copy and paste data you can just pivot table or do a shot directly from that and that's why I love it if you want to go further you can also consolidate you don't you can also avoid vup consolidate directly into powerquery you can also clean your data you can create specific capis but I'm not going to do that because I feel that this is this is not necessary to uh for this level of inventory optimization and if you want to go further you can check SM mymetric course and my Excel course as well com soon that's it for this video I see you for the next one and now we're going to start optimizing inventory
in this video we're going to talk about data cleansing to make sure that you have the right data in your in your base to make sure that you can optimize your inventory this is not the funniest part as well but this is very very important so I'm going to go back to very very basic uh process but you have to make sure you do it as well with your information in your company so I just to give you this is multiple example you need to check for example you need to make sure you don't have any negative values or empty sales or for sales or stock for example negative values so once you have the base it's much easier to check I recommend to do it at least once a week it just take one second you just say Okay do I have any negative stock no but if you have minus one sometimes you have minus two minus three so you can have minus uh negative stock if you have back orders um some system use this like negative values to okay to generate the back orders for to calculate the need but if it's not on purpose I I don't like to see negative Valu so make sure you don't have anything for warehouse make sure you don't have anything for total stock I make sure you don't have anything for your site stock as well I will do the same for my sales starting with you could have negative if you have returns from your customers um that's your that's your call if you want to to correct that but to be honest if I negative values you will add the negative average sales as well so I will have a formula that said if less than zero then zero if you have a need I don't have any specific specific file but sometimes you have negative value so make sure you double check that as well yeah my minimum value is zero okay so I go back to my steps negative value empty Sals uh zero that's okay we check that then let's see if we have any pricing missing so let's go to the price Tab and let's see if we have any pricing missing we do have pricing missing we have four item with no price and that's a very classic one when I do Consulting I always have price and cost price missing and if you don't have the right price you cannot for example have the value of your inventory or the sales the value of yourself so this is critical that you have this check you send it maybe to your finance department or marketing hey guys we have these four cods missing you can also do it directly from your base here let's do this one if you have to if you want to have a followup you can see that these products are new maybe that's the reason but what you could here is your action lag is you could say Okay price missing and you just press control enter and then you have it for this three so that could be something like you could use as a follower you say okay I need to fix my price and that's something very you could uh you could have these uh actions to follow all right and you what you can see as well if you go to curent connection you can see that in price no we don't have this anymore yeah we don't we have we just have zero so I go back to this no re so price missing is done this is boring I know but make sure check table format and item Cod sometimes you have um so this is number format if you go to the professional level my Bas wasse in text format so you have to make sure you have the you all your items have the same some sometimes you could see oh but this one is in number format so it doesn't work uh etc etc just to show you one example if this one was in a text format if you want text format you do this it's going to crash all of this so what you could do for example you could just double check if you don't have any any any na for example and say okay I need to fix this ah it's because I need to convert convert this into text format if you use Pro query I was explaining that before you can do it automatically so let's go back to for example price going to double check you don't need to master that but just to let you know if your if your con is in you can change the the format of the item code directly from text if I go to text and I replace it will be automatically you don't have to do any manipulation it will be automatically done each time you refresh this file so I will go back to whole number but that's a very efficient way to automatically clean your file you can also um I'm not I want have a I can give you another example after for example if you you say Okay I want to have the the Brand number you could say okay I will I I just I don't want to have brand I just want to have one you could also do it automatically but I'm going I give you more example in the bonus I have a bonus power query in this course so check that if you want to know more about how to clean your your data with po query okay so that's cool what else do we have in the data cleansing so price missing is done check the table format item codes that's okay uh also check item set with no sales in the last three months with forecast if you do have forecast so let's go back to my base item statue with no sales so let's take the 13 weeks zero and let's see the one with forast so interesting we do have forecast for all of these products and what we could do is we could say we could say okay check item stute you could say okay in this specific ones you say okay if they are new it's okay so let's remove the new one because they they are not selling yet so now we have active and discontinued let say okay what is important is to make sure that this item salary is correct and if it's discontinued it's okay but I will definitely have to disable the focus and we'll go back to this but why do we have focus on this items because they're discontinued right so there is a problem all the stud is incorrect or we need to disable the forecast and then for active ones okay this one are active they don't have sales for the last 13 weeks but they do have forecast and uh for that for me or there is we need to disable the the products or the forast are wrong but we're going to get back to this as well okay so it's very important that you understood you you can see in this F now I in a glance I have a very clear view of what is what looks corent and I need to make sure that this item stary is correct for all my items okay so check that the next one will be to check so we done that the next one will be to check item s with with active forecast so let's see the this file we go back to the base is let's see this time the active ones and see the one with no forecast so let's take the four weeks forecast zero and you can see that this one okay so they don't have forecast but they are forecast for the next 13 and 26 weeks so I don't know it doesn't make a lot of sense for me but or they they don't plan to sell anything or uh they need to change the they switch the the S of these items to maybe discontinued products okay so that's very one again this is very basic but this is so important because I can see in many all my companies you have so many products because just they don't have the right statue we keep ordering products that we don't need or we forget to have automatic ORD of forecast because we don't have the right stue and with this file you can check very very simply in a in a glance like in few minutes it's checked and you can then act act if you need to change anything in your e database the next one is check new item salue which sells more than zero so let's check the new ones new products means they're not active yet so we plan to sell them we do have forecast let's remove all of this I just want to make sure we go to new and we want to see if we do have sales right so there is no sell but if you have a new products that are selling or any information you need to switch them to active to make sure that you can also track the the the avability to make sure that all the orders and safety so calculation are active as well but let's say if you had one with like one quantity here we say oh there is a problem with this one we have to make sure that we do have Safety stock calculation and that you can also because you see we don't have any safety so I'm not going back to this for formula after um if like you see Safety stock value zero because this item is new and we only have to calculate and raise orders for active products okay so that was just one example you can have your specific R for your company but I do recommend to have a checklist and to have someone in your team checking this file every week and say okay did I check this yes yes yes and no and that's why I love checklist because when you have checklist you can't miss anything you just have to make sure that people respect the uh checklist all right so in the next video I'm going to talk about kpis and we're going to we're going to start to have more fun to optimize the inventory but this is the right foundation you need to have the right file with all the information inside and to clean them as consistency as possible and then you can start analyzing and focusing on your optimization
next kpi we talk about the fiar rate so i' I've been explaining the fiar rate before you can check this link if you want to know more about what is the fiar rate but for the F rate you need to have the demand and you need to know okay what was supply to the customer whatever it's a retail B2B or like R material suppliers okay so for the fear rate is good to have it we do have this information from the sales Tab and you can see that we have the Sal quantity and we have the demand and the fear rate is the ratio between what was the demand and what was Supply if you don't have this information start maybe it's very important when you receive the order if you don't Supply the fully this information and you start recording uh that's something very useful it's more powerful than avability because you also have how much you are losing it's not only about Z 0% or 100% it's about okay are you losing because you could have 0% availability and missing one sale or you could have 0% availability and missing one million sales and that's the PO of the field rate but for that you need to to separate sales and demand or bending orders so what I've done in this file again I keep it kept it very simple we go to F right here and what I did I did I did a pivot table directly from my uh sales um my sales tab so this is my sales I'm going to do it again for you you can just open it and let's open let's do another per table and what we want to what we want to see we want to see the item codes and I want to see the demand quantity and the say Quantity and I want to do the ratio between these two okay so let's do it what we're going to do we're going to calculate field so you could do it manually but I don't want so I'm going to do it calculate field and I'm going to call it field F rate and what I'm going to [Music] do I'm going to divide Sayes by demand so you can I recommend o I recommend that you do it if possible in value because if you sell like very low item like low price item and very an expensive item and you want to consolidate I always recommend to do it in value sales price or cost price make sure you use the same valuation for these two so let's do sales in value divided by demand in value per item you w have any different but if you want to consolidate per brand that you will have a big difference for that's it so now we do have the fear rate perfect and what do we need else we want to have it for this year and per week great so we don't need this anymore I'm going to remove this I'm going fast but it's okay you can just replay if you need and we want per year to see Evolution bam great great and where is that and we also want to see uh the sum of field rate for this graph so we don't need per item for that you don't need you can just copy and paste this tab contr C and you can just remove item code and the weak number only the total if you want time where is that design great back and then you can insert a pivate chart line so you do have your Fe rate for year one year two and and then you can copy and paste in your dashboard so I've done aen this but this is exactly the same in expert level I've done the pivot for per item and the one for the graph per item I did a vup in my base I think on the right this here you could see the field rate year to date what is year to date is what is the value this year and what what is the value this year is the the current year so 2021 with this specific data set F rate I just be look up this colum with this one so the year to date is 2021 and I go back to my base here to date field rate last year is from last year and what else do we need this is the warehouse typability and for the the dashboard uh you just copy and paste the H I did copy and paste the F we I could do it let's do it now C I'm going to copy and paste this in the dashboard always live updates let's put it here and let's see if I can copy and paste no going to try to do the same format yes it's working fear rate perfect so now I do have the fear rate as well I can leave it this here and you have a beautiful dashboard I've done the avilability brand before and we're going to do this after so we do have the F right now so we can check the box and then we're going to talk talk about discontin stock I've done that before so I'm going to do it quick inventory accuracy and forecast accuracy
in this episode we're going to talk about the quality of your inventory first of all the discontinued stock Obsolete and then the inventory accuracy so the discontin St I've done that before so I'm not going to I'm going to repeat super fast if you go to the file what is really important you have the right information of what is discontinue or not you can use different date you have you also have to check I was in my previous I was checking okay how do make sure that you can double check if you have the forecast if you have like sales on your discontin stock or not to make sure that this is an accurate information and then we have we just have to we can just pivot table this into pivot base here so you're going to do another pivot table and what you're going to do in pivot base you have the discontin stock like what we say we have the the percentage of discontin stock 10% and to have this information you just click on percentage of ground total okay in it's important in percentage I feel it's more important in percentage than value right so you have this information now what we want to talk about is inventory accuracy so what is inventory accuracy is most of the company they don't have accurate stock because of stock disappear it get stolen it get broken and what is important is to have the same information between what is in your database look let's go back to the stock base so it's great to have this information but sometime you say okay I have for example this one I I have 73 quantities but maybe in reality in my warehouse or factory I just have zero because we lost the pet or we got stolen so it's very important to make sure that we have the the the most accurate information and for that we do what we call stock take and what I was doing stock Tech when I was a student at night after the the closing of the warehouse or the supermarket I was working very very late from midnight and I was counting my products one by one and most of the time was less done more but sometime it was sometime it was more as well if you the supplier was deliver was supplying too much and for that we need this this what we call stock TCH so which basically you probably know this process already you're going to print all your products or you're going to have a scan and we we're going to say okay what what is the new stock and for for some of them it's a lot of quantities so we will count per pet not totally and the the other question is how often do you have to check your your stock Tech legally you have to do it before the closing of your the fiscal year in most of the countries in the world so you will do it at the end of the year or in June if you're in Australia for example uh but for most of the company they do it more than once a year and I recommend if your focus if your inventory accuracy is really bad I will do it more often than once a year for sure I'm going to give you more advice after uh so you need to have this information and you have to make sure that you check in the same time there is no movement of stock during this period if you start counting but you are still selling it's going to be a complete mess so just to give you one example this is one stock Tech example then you're going to check with the base so we do have we're only talking about the wh stock and I think on the right I have the forast the quality of my inventory where is that inventory accuracy I have so many kpi sometimes I'm getting lost no Transit where is my inventory accuracy probably here there we go we got it so we do have stock take we have the stock Tech quantity and then what is important is to say okay is it the same value so my formula is just if my stock equal my stock Tech then 100% if not 0% whatever you have one quantity or 1,000 quty change you can do it first in percentage like avability then what is interesting is to have what is this the Gap in value because that's I think I feel that's the most important information is what is the the Gap in value and you can see that okay you will just do the difference between stock Tech and stock Tech quantity multiply by cost price and in this specific example for example we were supposed to have 7,000 but at the end we have only 378 so my stock Tech in my inventory Gap just for this code is $638,000 which is a lot and you can then filter down like this and you can see okay where where are my main you see sometimes my file is a bit slow so if it's too slow you can go to formula and manual here okay because I have too many I'm recording the same time so that's why so you can see that this is your the main gape you have you have it positive so we found more stock for this one and you can have it smallest to largest and in this case that's where you are losing basically money and you have the total and the total is basically after the stock Tech you lost 4.5 million of inventory which is a good news for the cash flow but it's a bad news as well because you lost this money as well and you are also you probably have out of stock just because of that as well for example this let's take the [Music] zero and this one for example they were supposed to order products but they didn't because they had stock and but if you really update the stock you you're already out of stock today so it's very important that you update I'm not going to use this information for my uh need and calculation because you need to confirm that before updating I just wanted to give you one example and if you want to see okay then what is the the inventory accuracy of my stock you just do a pivot table so let's do it again switch here boom oops Yeah no I'm going to do I'm going to take from one one existing it's inventory accuracy so I'm going to take this up I'm going to copy and paste I'm going to remove this so what you do is like okay what is my inventory you can also type inventory accuracy you have your total and you have your inventory Gap and the total you want the average and the Gap you want the total de okay so we have 90% of inventory accuracy that mean that 90% of the inventory has no change after the stock dech and the total inventory Gap is $4.5 million negative and then you can maybe display per Brun if you want to see per per Brun here okay so you can see oh there is a big problem is Brun four but in value the biggest problem is BR number one even if we have 92% of uh inventory accuracy and then you can create a link to the dashboard to see okay this is my inventory accuracy I will also probably add something reging the top the top Gap in terms of inventory accuracy I didn't do that but you could do it maybe per item like we did for for the top stock top time stock I would do it maybe for um for the um the accuracy that's maybe something you can do in the as an exercise for the next episode
next episode we're going to talk about the kpi forecast accuracy uh we do need the forast accuracy because forast is important right you don't necessarily need the if you don't have Focus it's okay we're going to talk about Focus later uh but we're going to use the focus accuracy especially for the XY Z analysis and this time last time we were using the the demand deviation but this time we want to use the forecast accuracy so it's not a full I'm not going to to spend two hours about Focus accuracy I was talking about the Fus accuracy during my essay metrics course you can also check I have a specific link here for the four different calculations in this article if you want to go further uh but I just wanted to give you a few example in this tool so you go on the right and you can see Focus accuracy this is just the the different methods to to calculate the the forecast you need to have the forecast and you need to have the what was the the demand it's very important to to use the demand not the sales when you talk about forast accuracy and basically if you want to calculate uh you need to have first the absolute error what is the difference between the demand and the forecast so we're going to use the absolute value and then you have multiple way to calculate you have the Bas the map the M the Ms and the RMS I'm only going to focus on this one because I don't recommend especially the map one the map one is basically basically you calculate the forecast so it's the absolute error divided by the demand I always recommend in value as well uh because if you have one product we we're selling much more in value it's important to have I guess more impact I don't like to have an average of the accuracy and that's what is doing the map so the Mi is going to do the sum of the all the this error divided by uh the if you check this formula oops percentage of error you're going to divide the sum of all the eror divided by the the demand in a value so it's not an average it's not this it's just the all all the serup item absolute because otherwise they they could compensate each other and we're going to divide this the absolute by the total demand and that will give you the what we call the mean absolute error or the mean absolute deviation this is the two different name for the same formula so we apply this for um for the I recommend this one for most of the most of the demand planner and sulation team this one MSO and R meod they're using like more complex formula it can be useful in machine learning and data science but I don't recommend it for your demon planning team because it's it's way enough to use this one okay so if you want to know more check my article or you can also if you already if you're already part of mymetric course you can check I have two or three episodes regarding forecast accuracy but in this specific case let's just say that okay we already have a forecast it's in the data expert this is the the file so in this Focus accuracy file we do have the focus per per week it's already calculated so I'm not going to go much uh into details because it really depends um you could calculate the focus accuracy one week before two weeks before one month before that's what I was talking um explaining in this what we call the forecast Horizon so check this article if you if you have more questions or if you're part of SM metric you can check uh all my episodes to know how to do it so if I go back to this file so I just upload this uh forast accuracy I wanted to have just the average per item not to Total but per item so what you can do you can just do that or you can recalculate from scratch your this specific API and you just go to insert P table and the item code and the focus accuracy like this and peror because I like to I I like to have it only for for the current year for my then we're going to use it for the ABC XYZ analysis or you could you could do it per per week as well if you want but I want to keep it simple once again all right so you do have the focus accuracy I did the same in this one I'm using a power query for that so I don't need to copy and paste the full there we go I don't need to copy and paste the full uh table and then we're going to connect to my file here and you can see the forus accuracy you can see the focus accuracy for this for last year and year to date uh that you can then it's a good it's a good tool then you can analyze and see okay which one are which products have the worst or best Focus accuracy have a specific mod talking about forus just after in few in few modeles okay so stay with me okay we do have another forecast and we going also use it for XY Z analysis later so I'm going to I'm going to stop for this and I see you for the next episode
in this video we're going to talk about the inventory turnover per item so yes this is another kpi should be part of it but I feel this is something I want to separate because this is very important one of the most useful parameters and we're going to go back to this so in the in the the professional level and Foundation we're using only one stock turn based on the last eight weeks or four weeks sales history but this time we're going to have three levels so let's go back to this if you go back to this this F you can see oh we have stock turn week minus 13 26 and plus 13 so the main difference this time is we do have forecast so we're going to use this forecast to estimate what will be uh the the inventory turnover in the past like a mix between past and future and in the future and it's good to see if there is a difference or not especially for new products if you have a new products with no pass sales you will see all my inventory over is 9999 it's like huge like a huge value but if you have B forec coming the next few weeks your inventory if you only if you use your forecast for example maybe this this product let's take an example this one you had 158 days based on the last 13 weeks 112 if weix past sales and forecast I'm going to explain to you just after and 87 only if we only base on the the the next forecast okay so that's what we're going to do so the formula is the same we're going to divide the stock in value divide it by the sales of the last 13 weeks so I'm using the same this one last 13 weeks sorry I'm moving a bit multiply by the cost price it's very important to use the cost price and not the sales price multiply by the perod 13 * 7 so to have the number of days right so we do have this metrix the first one is terrible then the 26 weeks what is that we're going to mix we're going to divide the stock divided by the sales of the last 13 weeks plus the forecast of the next 30 weeks so keep in mind that we do use the forecast here and to have the forecast what I've done before this is the forecast I we we've done a pivot forecast pivot like we did for the sales and we're using last four weeks last 30 weeks last 26 and last 52 so it's very convenient to see okay what is what are the next forast and then we can use it to improve our visibility regarding the stock turn or inventory turn over stock turn or inventory turnover is the same kpi I'm just two different names okay and you can then we're going to do the same this time only with forecast okay so we have past sales a mix between past and next previous and to forecast and passes and only forecast and sometimes you have the same Trend like this one is exactly the same you see like at the end that's why I was telling you it's not a big deal if you don't have forecast sometimes because most of for most of the time you have almost the same value you know like when it's red it's red most of the time this one maybe not if we check for example new items it may be probably very different it's very useful for new items you see like most of the new items if you only base on the the past history Sal hisory you have no data so because we have no data we put 999 but if we Bas on the forecast we can already plan what will be the inventory to another and um we also have for with no stock in the world yet that's why they have zero today okay so I hope you understand the the main difference between that and then we also going to calculate the stock turn for the dashboard in the dashboard you can see 145 days which is a lot and for this 145 days if we go back to the pivot base we can see 145 here and this 145 it's a calculate field so we can we can do it again let's copy any any uh pivot table calculated field let's call it stock turn two and we're going to divide the stock in value it's very important in value not in quantity because we want to have we don't want to have the we want to have the the weight of the Quant not the quantity but the value of your stock so stock stock stock in value divided by we're going to use the mix of so it's simple and I'm going to close this in my base I do have a specific column for that and I'm going to multiply forecast last 13 weeks plus like forecast next C weeks plus sales of the last s weeks multiply by the cost price it's very important to have this colum then you can multip you can divide the stock in value by this column and it's in cost price not sales price we're going to use this one for ABC analysis so I go back to my Pivot I'm going to change this to calculated field so I'm going to do another one stock turn two equal stock divided by say forecast multiply by uh we do have 26 weeks so 26 multiply by 7 add okay I have a problem because of this who sorry there we go so we now we have the same value 145 days which is very useful to see okay you can see between Bron four and brand five we have a big um big difference and that's what we're going to focus to to improve okay so we do have the stock turn for the dashboard 145 five and we do have it for the base you can Define alerts it's conditional formatting I explained that before if you check the rules um we have multiple conditional formatting they're all together because it's not only this colon but all the columns but it's important to define a specific row based on these parameters and you can change these parameters by switching this if it's working yes yes it's working I just need to refresh sometimes with my formulas it was in manual that's why okay so now it's working we have uh we have this tool that we we're going to use to clean uh really fast or stock so it's very useful if you don't have the forecast it's okay once again you can use only the past sales that will be enough to do the job but I feel like it's cool also to to combine with forast before taking any decision to maybe review the forecast sell any orders or having a promotion to improve the the inventory turnover
okay slowly but surely we are going to the the right direction so now we do have the inventory turn of item we are not talking about the ABC classification and the XYZ classification so I've done a lot of ABC classification before so I'm not going to repeat this one the only difference is we're going to use the forecast and also we're going to use uh the the forecast accuracy for the XY Z classification so I'm going to talk about these two in one episode for my abc what we going to do you need to have a colon so in the in the professional and Foundation level if I go back to this file I was only using the sum of I think was if we go back to ABC that was a professional level I was using the past 26 week sales for example okay so that was in the professional level now we do have this information of focus great we could we should use this Focus but sometimes the focus is not not always accurate right we do have a focus accuracy but it's not perfect so what I like to do I like to combine in the same time the past sales and the future so what we're going to do we're going to go back to expert expert we go back to the base and we do have this we did this one for inventory turnover now we're going to use this one for ABC analysis and we're just going to sum the forecast and the say multiply by the Sal Price this time okay we do have this value and we're going to use this value to for the ABC analysis and if I I go back to my abc analysis here I'm using the same methodology with the same like ranking and stuff but this time instead of having I'm going to show you this so before we had this now we're using not only the PS but the mix between forecast and sales which will be for me it's a safe way to to have what what really happen in the past and what is going to happen in the future you could even include the demand and not the sales if you have the demand in value that would be even better but I want to keep it simple for this one just to give you ideas most of the companies use sales and demand but it will be even better to use the demand so if you want to be perfect use the demand if you have relevant information so I'm using sales and forecast I'm going to I'm going to sort descending to make sure we do have an ABC classification and now this item number 24 is the number one based on the last 13 weeks uh Sales Plus next 30 weeks 30 weeks forecast okay we can check this item to see how it looks in value or we can just filter like this largest to smallest okay cool and this is the biggest one and when I check my abc analysis this is the number one 1.48 then we have itm 10 etc etc okay so this is my top salers and then you can link directly to your um to your file and that's for me that's that's a good way for ABC the question is are you why are you using 26 weeks you could also use eight weeks in the past eight weeks in the future or if you have like a lot of like fashion products if you have like a very short period to to sell you could also use four weeks in the past and for we in the future and if you have very slow sale very slow moving products you could use um last 26 plus 2 six as well okay so it really depend on that I was supposed to record the XY Z in the same episode but I feel I want to split so we're going to see that in the next episode for the XYZ analysis with the forecast
in this episode we're going to go back to the XY Z analysis in the previous module professional we were using the what do we call the standard deviation of the of the cells to Define okay which one has the more level of uncertainty right so you can see this on uh the standard deviation the good way of the standard deviation is the fact that it's um it's quite simple to implement the problem is like sometime let's get into one example for example for example these products um these products they have the same variation in terms of standard deviation and coefficient of variation as well but one of these two seems to be more predictable and the other one seems to be not predictable and probably that the number item number one would would probably have like a forus accuracy of accuracy of maybe let's say 70% and the other one maybe something around I don't know 30% okay and in this case it's more relevant if you have access to this information of focus accuracy to base your classification not only on your your deviation of the demand but on your focus accuracy and know we do have the focus accuracy in the expert uh module so that's what we're going to use okay so we're going to go back to this file we do have the sales pivot for the standard deviation I'm going fast always because I feel like you already know that for the for the XYZ analysis so we do have the standard deviation of the last 52 weeks perfect and the variation coefficient is the the standard deviation divided by the quantity of theity to weeks divided by 52 to have the average okay or you can also have use the average formula so that we give you a coefficient of variation and then we did a classification on XY Z based on the number of items and once again you ask me oh Ed what is what is the the right repetition between XY Z let's go back to the Pro in the Pro we had what was the pro we had 30 50 and more than 50 in this one I told you before I like to have a classification close to the abc1 but it's not necessarily the case but in this case I keep like if you do 30 what was the one 30 and 50 30 and 50 we do have three and 9 and 87 I do feel that this is not enough I want to have at least like I want to have at least 5% of my X produ so I will go to 50 we already have 1% 80 I could also do this way but I think I like I like my previous way so I'm going to keep this one 3565 you can play with that there there is no golden rules the most important is especially if you want to optimize your inventory it's better to have more products in your Z then then you can sacrifice than to have too many in your X that you're going to protect okay so you can play with these numbers and I'm going to go back to this uh once again how to adapt this parameters but I feel like this is a good repetition we have 20 23% of my item XY and we have a lot of um uncertain products with a focus with the the coefficient of variation of more than 65 so to calculate my XYZ Focus accuracy we do need a focus accuracy and this one is coming from my tab forast accuracy where is my tab this one and this one we're going to use only the one from 2021 you can use the current year you can use the last uh 52 weeks you could also use the the ground total I think we're using let me check I'm not even sure the ad3 ad one two three so we are using only the C here be careful if you only have one or two weeks don't use the current year you could use maybe the full year if it's or the the past year the ground total if you have if you're studing the the beginning of the year okay make sure you have at least like eight weeks of focus accuracy uh I would say at least 10 if if you are doing a classification like this so we do have the focus accuracy and then we need to uh um we need to classify and we're going to use the same principle for that this formula is if my focus accuracy this time is more than 75 then it's X if it's more than 50 it's Y and if it's less it's uh Zed okay and for that y 75 one y 15 one y less than 50 you need to play with the numbers I was playing with the numbers and I feel okay if I go to 80 I only have 3% of my itm so I want to have at least five uh so I'm going to play to 75 for that if I go to 70 I have 10% I could also keep a 10% of that that will the real impact will be what will be your inventory policy per category and you can you can adjust as well so I will keep 75 then I say okay I want to I will say yeah but why not 60 but 60 we only have 12% I could keep that but I want to have uh I like to have run numbers as well and when you have less than 50% per accuracy it's really really not accurate so we do have seven 7% of X 21% of Y and 72 of Z so it's almost the same repetition if I want to have the same I could do like something like this probably 60 uh 65 no 75 sorry but no I'm getting slow it will be 55 that will be something like that and that would be very similar in the number of products but not the same products okay so you can see it's this one are different this one are different but most of them are very similar right most of them so that's why it's important to understand like it's okay if you don't have the focus accuracy most of the time when you have a strong varation of your demon it's not easy to forast but sometime it's a very seasonal products and it's it's easier to forast but you can see that you don't have most of the products are very similar in this specific case okay so we do have this uh classification let's keep it this way then let's go back to so we have these two way and let's go back to the base and in the base I did a v cup of the XY Z Sals and I did another one with the the forecast and we're going to use the XYZ forecast but it's good to have these two just in case if you don't trust your forecast accuracy calculation or if you don't have forecast and you can see once again that would be good to see what was what who was X before and which one is not X we don't have Zed so that will be the main varation for that you see this would and you you will be the opposite for the other one so you can I recommend you to take one or two example and to observe and to look okay if it looks if it looks okay for you and if it looks okay for you you can keep the formula or you can adjust the parameters to say no no this is quite stable I can maybe adjust and say I can move maybe to 60 or 50% of forast accuracy so that's now we have another method for that I hope this is clear and once again don't look for Perfection start play uh estimate the impact of the inventory and the Safety stock value we're going to do that later and you you have plenty of time to adjust and play with these numbers
in this video we're going to talk about sales projection to see okay what is the to to see what was the past gross and what is the the gross base on the total of all the the itm focus in your system if you do have a focus if you don't have a focus this is a very useful video as well a very strategic so please stay with me it's going to be a bit technical with Excel but you don't need to get all the Excel tricks the most important is to understand the principle and why it's important to have this kind of uh graph to see the future so let's have a look quickly on this graph we do have the sales the sales from last year in in white where the green one is the current year from my data set of course if you are in 2030 you can use this one from 2030 uh we do have the growth this each so we have a multi-axis uh graph on the left we have the sales in value and on the right we have the percentage of grow okay and the the red one is the forecast based on the the total of all the item forecast in the system and this is the percentage of growth versus last year so what do you think of this graph do do you think we tend to are we good are we do we have we tend to over Focus under Focus what do you think stop for 10 seconds and think about it going to drink some tea okay so what do I from my point of view I love this kind of graph because I can see quickly like for example in this company we have way too much the forast are way too too high in the system so if we see this also this kpi so the target is to grow by 10% the year to date means like from the beginning of this year the average growth is 8% but if we combine all the for the next forecast for the and we only have like 10 weeks left the total forecast for the full year will be plus 15% and we can see that just next week will be plus 49 then plus 49 again then plus 45 and we can see that we we are selling much more than last year so when I see that quickly can see uhoh we have a problem we probably have way too much forecast and the consequence for that would be also probably way too much inventory and we can see we're going to see that in the next episodes how to build this graph inventory projection and for sure but the rec cause of inventory issues is probably coming from um too high forecast okay so now I'm going to explain to you how to how to design this graph it's going to be a bit technical it's okay if you don't get all my Excel tricks the the most important once again is to understand the principle okay even if you don't have Focus today I feel like this is something very important that you need to to keep in mind and uh what even if you don't have like forecast per item you could also do like corporate forecast Global forecast and compare to the the previous um your Sal history as well okay so for that we do have a tab called projection and in this tab we have a lot of columns okay so I'm going to go I don't want to spend like two hours to because it took me like something like two hours to design this tab you can just check the formulas and if it's too complex you don't have to use all uh the kpis for example especially at the end you don't need to use the stock turn etc etc so I'm going to focus first on the sales projection and then inventory projection but you can go back slowly in this with this Excel if you feel like I'm going too fast you can also build this file uh and this graph per months if you're working per month it depends on how your your company is working is it per month per week or per day but I do not recommend to work per day I I feel like week is the best for seasonality for piloting and for projection as well all right so what do we do first we need first to have the SES right 2020 and 2021 for that I'm using power query but you can also do a this is a pivot table from my sales tab I'm going to just do the beginning just to show you again so you just press anywhere pivot table from no I'm going to do from external data source if you're not using powerquery you can just take it from your sales tab I'm going to take the sales new worksheet no new worksheets great and what do I want I want to have my sales in value we also going to use the sales in cost price why do we need cost price for the inventory projection after and we're going to switch this two I'm going to remove the total R but that's it we do have or and I'm going to invert this so I have my sales in sales price and I have my sales in cost price okay if you don't have the cost price you just multiply the sales quantity multiply by the cost price or the average cost price if you do have this information right so this is what I've done here I have my pivot table I have my weeks say price go then I do just I just designed this weeks I'm going to I'm going to convert this into week number I'm going to explain why it's for the year to-day calculation it's okay if I'm going a bit too fast just just check my file after but just I just really want you to understand that this file is also completely automatic so you don't have to touch anything it's like the year number if you are in 2028 it's a link from my tab so you don't need to change anything so it's quite powerful and useful you just need to spend few hour few maybe one or two hours at the beginning and then it's done so we do have 2020 2021 I just add an equal and you see in my formula if this is blank then na why do I do that I'm doing that because I'm going to show you here so I'm doing this basically so B6 and B okay so if I do this graph boom you can try as well and pause this video boom I have this ugly like boom okay you don't want this like when you because then I'm going to use this graph for my my like bard of director presentation later it's one of the bonus after you you know you don't want to have this kind of GRA it doesn't look great right so what I'm going to do is I'm just add the formula if I go back to projection if this is blank then I put Na and by adding a is like it's an error I'm I'm on purpose I'm adding one error to then because when you have one error it's not zero so I'm going back to insert I know you see I don't have this curve going like like this okay so that's why I'm doing that great so now we do I'm going to zoom a bit we do have sales last year current here the current is not finished yet then we do have the gross we just divide one by the others easy then it would be great to have something like a sales Target to say okay what what is your target for this year so you can you have multiple way to do it uh usually you have you have an annual number so let's say okay we want to grow by 10% it's coming from your CEO the supply chain should be involved in the in this I was always involved when I was director to say okay based on my because I was the number guy you know so I was really focus on okay what would be the best Focus for that so let's say 10% okay so we do 10% and then I did a sales Target in a per per week and for that or you can just do 10% versus the same week of last year or what I did I did like the the seasonality I did a smooth um I did a smooth Target so I just did the average of the week before the week after and the current R multiply by 1 plus 10% so it's a bit smoother like if I look like this and like this just to show you so you see that my target is the the orange one is you have is moer than the the the cells from last year you have multiple way to do it this is not the goal of this video but just to let you know that you could also use directly the seasonality that we're going to go back to uh for you can use you could use the seasonality of the ground total uh to apply your plus 10% versus last year okay so I go back to my projection now we have we could have the what is the sales Target growth per week if you need a it's sometimes good for team to okay what do how much do we have to grow per week so it's just the the division between the sales Target and versus last year all right and then we do have also I'm going to use this later I just did a link of what is my what what is the value of my sales in cost price not in sales price we're going to use it in the cost projection later so I'm not using this right now then the next say now we have all the forecast we have the Target now we need okay what we what is the forast what is the focus and for for me the forecast is coming from the sum of all my products with a forecast in the system and most of the time when you do this time it looks a bit scary because or it's too low or it's too high in this specific example it looks way too high okay so that's why we need to see the the big picture first and then we have a specific module then we're going to correct all these forecasts uh and the the major deviation after so we go back to the projection we do have first of all we need to have the forecast what do we have in the system so for that if you go back we do have the forecast here this is the just like all the forecast per per item forecast quantity forecast in sales price and also forecast in cost price if you don't have it once again you can multiply by the cost price so what I'm going to do I'm going to delete this and do it again we are going to um create a pivot table from this great existing work sheets and what I want to see I want to see period I want to see I want to see quantity but I don't need quantity to be honest and if voila we do have this value great all right so we do have the sales quantity Sal value and cost price perfect I've done that before and then what we need we need to link we need to link this forecast with the in this tab so to do that you have multiple way what I'm going to do is I'm going to vup it's a multiple vook up I V up the number of the week and the what is the current here we are using so you can see in my I have a concatenation I do week and year because then it's completely Dynamic you don't have to do anything you just have to if you're are moving to the next here you don't have to change any formula so check my formula if you think I'm going too fast I just concatenate the week and the the year number to be able to get the forast and in my forast in this tab I just do my V look up from this to get this colum so we look up with colum number three all right check my formula if it's too so we do have the focus now great and we can also calculate already okay what will be the gross of my focus versus last year so this is this formula and for the gross we're going to we we're going to compare what is this is the value of my focusing sales price and what will be the gross versus 2020 and we do have plus 49 plus 49 plus 45 which is a lot so that's the first warning that we have okay then then we have the forecast we do also have the forecast in 2022 we're not going to use it for the graph but it's useful if you if you want to see more visibility this is the growth for 2022 for the the year after and also in percentage and we're going to use this one later so okay so now we have all this information say great edar good job it will take maybe maybe 30 minutes to to together all this information but then once you have it let's do this beautiful graph so we're going to do what we call a multiaxis graph with first the sales and then the grow so let's start first the sales I'm going to select these two going to do insert like this cool all right so now we do have the sales what do we want next we want to have the forecast right so the forecast is keep me in mind this is the one and what I did in this one is I did okay if we in the past it's very important to you understand this formula because I don't want to have I just want to have my forast if it's in the future okay but if it's in the past I just say in my formula okay if it's in the like we in week six I'm just using the the real set I'm not using the forecast value because we don't I don't even have forus so it will be like zero but I don't want zero because I just want to have the same curve behind the other one so in my formula just say my for okay I get the forecast but if it's if there is an error I just get the sales history so we're going to add this formula here this not this formula this series forecast so the series name is this one and this is cool I'm going to also change the name of this one and this is all Dynamic so when we move to next here all this will change automatically as well cool so now we do have the forecast but I don't see my sales anymore H so what are we going to do now let's go back to select data and what we can do is we can change the forecast to move it at the top you see oh now I can see it I can move again so now I can see that's why you need to have like two curves and one I needs to be at the top and you wants to see at the top the the the forecast then you can see the same time the forus and the s in this graph so it's pretty cool I like this kind of visual you like it cool so now let's add the grow for last year and current year so what we're going to do so we're going to just to show you what we're going to do first we want to see this percentage of growth let's go back to this select data we're going to add the gross of 2021 no this is the wrong one and this is the name great and we also want to have the percentage of growth um the percentage of focus grow this one up and this one is blank if we don't have forecast great I'm very proud of you okay so now we go back to the graph but we have another problem with the gra oh we don't see much about this growth okay so what we're going to do now we need to change the type of graph so change chart type and we need to go to two different axis so we can go to on the on the button combo and then we can decide what kind of graph do we want so we want line for this one right and for this one we want bars and what we want also we want in a different axis so we just select this and this great we're getting closer amazing so we know we do have this it looks pretty cool then you can change the label you can change the colors and what we can do as well because I don't want to see too much here so I'm going to reduce the size of my gross here so I'm going to move to one yeah something like this and now we are very close to the one we want so I'm going to go back to this and go back to the dashboard here then you can change the color I don't have the same color but you could go to blue one change all of these but this is basically a very similar graph okay so I hope you like this video this is a very useful tool uh for the graph the only thing missing is the year today so we we're going to go back to the year to date right now the year to date information is very useful because you want to know okay the the forecasting growth for the full year is we're going to divide the sum of the forast and in the past we're using S history we're going to divide like last year forecast divided by last year sales and we can see okay we're growing by by plus 15% based on the current forecast obviously this is not for me correct because we our forecast is way to high but this is what we have in the system what I would like to know as well is okay but what was the forecast in the past like until today for the the current year and for that we are using I create this formulas for you I feel it's very useful always to have okay what is the full projection and what is the current gross and we can see that we have plus %. how do we get plus % we're using what we call like a su if formula and in this Su if formula you can check lat later slowly I'm going to I just want to have the sum of all my grow in uh only until this week you know because I don't want to have the gross if I do like just the total I will have a gross of this divided by this it will be like something like okay we are growing by minus 18% why because last year we had 52 weeks of sales and this year we have 41 so I have all of this missing that's why I only have I have minus 18% so this number doesn't mean anything what you want to compare is apple with apple and to compare Apple with apple you need to compare this specific period so you want to compare this period with this period and for that I'm using a formula called sem if this is the one Su if here and I will just say okay just just do the sum of the Su if if and you need to add these specific characters my week number is less than my current week okay and my current we how do how do I get what is my current week my current week is coming from my pivot table sets XY Z and here I have my my latest period I can do it again for you you can just do like right this is my latest Weg two and I do have 40 41 like this okay the only thing you have to be careful when you do that is it's we need to have a number format because the weak number in my uh in my tab sales tab is in the text format so the condition sui won't work because it's a text format so so that's why I had to create another clone weak number I just multiply this by one just to convert into a weak number but without doing anything manually and then my sum if will just give me the sum to add end we have 136 million year to date and this year we have 147 so the year to date gross is plus 8% and this information is very useful compared to the plus 15% we had before like okay if I if I know some the full forecast plus s history versus last year I'm growing by 15% which is probably way too much because of all these insane weeks so I go back to my dashboard I just create a link have have my sales gross 8% Target 10% and forecast plus 15% and now we are done we have this beautiful graph which is very very useful like as a director manager I want to see this graph every week and I can tell you that the first the first time I'm going to see this gra say okay no we have an emergency we absolutely need to review and reduce your forecast but we're going to see that in the module how to review forecast in a in a shortterm way and in a longterm way with all my tools so I hope this is clear for you in the next video we're going to talk about inventory projection
okay so we did the sales projection and we can see that okay we have a problem we our forecast is probably way too high now we're going to talk about inventory projection so we're going to do the same okay what will be my stock in the future so the white one is last year the green one is this year and the the the red one is the projection for the next few weeks what do you think of this once again are we good no we are not good right and we do also have a Target so we're going to talk about also how to create a Target that's something very useful to say okay I'm above the tabag which is not good for my cash flow and my CFO my finan financial director won't be happy because we're going to spend more money that we our budget to um to to run and to buy inventory and for the service for our customer so that's also very very useful graph to have you could do it at the global level and if you want to go more into details you can to do it per perimeters brands or even per demon planner I'm going to show you at the global level and then feel free to adapt but the most important is first to have a clear picture for for the year and what we can see is we have a lot of stock and this is also all the what we call F orders and plan orders the F orders are already confirmed and probably in the boat the plan orders are the one we that's a forecast to buy so this what this this one could be cancelled if it's not too late at least much easier to canel right we we do have a stock gross year to dat by 18% the target was only to grow by 5% once we want one we have only have usually it's better to grow more in sales than inventory it makes sense I like to have this idea of if you go by 10 you only your sales you only grow your your inventory by 5% I'm going to get back to this and the forecast for the inventory is to grow by 20% Which is a lot so it's even more if we uh consider the full year and the stock Gap versus the target is more than 8 Millions on the on the annual level so we will have to finance and to pay for this extra 8 Millions with interest rate and probably also Overstock in the W etc etc just to give you an idea if you have 10 10% of annual costs in for your inventory there will be an extra cost impacting your profit by something like $800,000 which is a lot okay so it's important to have this clear picture like this one and in a glance I can really see okay we have way too much Stu coming our Focus are way too high we have to cancel something and reduce the the focus and canel maybe orders how do we do that we go back to projection again once again it's a big technical with Excel you you can go slowly after after checking this video but my idea is really to give you the the potential and then you can spend more time to see what is the best layout with Excel or with your Erp I do feel like in Erp system there is no I didn't find a really cool report for this specific information so what do we have we do have all the sales it's important to get the sales in um cost price because to have the forecast projection we need to compare Apple with Apple so you cannot we're going to we have all the forecast here we also have it in cost price you will understand why I'm saying that so we do need also the stock for 2020 and 2021 to be completely completely honest with you I don't have the stock per item per week for the last two years so for this one I just had a specific type called total stock so it's okay if you don't have it per item because it's a lot of data and a lot of information so in this one I just have a tab that I'm going to refresh every week and this tab is just the total stock okay and this this total stock we have the total stock in uh in value it's better if you have it per itm or per BR because then you can do the same graph per group of products per demon planner but I don't have this information because it's way too much data and for this data set I don't have it but if you have it you can do a pivot table per item per per week and recreate the same that we did with sales all right but most of the company don't have enough history for inventory per item or per category so I have this total stock I'm go back to the projection I just V up okay so not a big deal stock for last year stock for for this year and this time I just say like okay once again if my there is no information I just want to have an an error to like the say position before I don't want to have a curve dropping down I just want to see nothing and when I do my graph like this let's try like this insert graph great so I do have this I have my graph and I don't have this this curve dropping down because I have my a a here then what we what do we need we need the forecast stock for this year what is the formula for that what do we need we need uh the stock of the current week we need also to have the fee orders and plan orders because we need to basically what is my stock today plus all my orders coming the same week minus my my forecast not in sales price but in cost price because my inventory is in cost price so it's very important to use to compare Apple with apple once again if you if you have 100 million in stock and you you you will reduce by the sales in sales price it doesn't make any sense this like the inventory turnover always use the same metric and valuation when you do this kind of formula so what do we need we need the F we have we need the F order and plan order so for that we have a tab FM orders and plan orders I'm going to get back to this for the suppliers analysis but what is important is just to do a p table I'm going to do it again for you because it's you okay and I just want to have the total per week what is my week yes and I want to have the value of course the value is in cost price not sales price right you follow me cool so we do have this I did the same for plan order the difference is plan is a projection it's a forecast to buy and FM order it's already confirmed by the supplier so it's much more difficult to canel and it's good if you can have this most of the company big companies have these two if you only have one just put one like f orders like you don't have I did the same for the the same pivot table pivot table and know how to pronounce pivot no we have this we have the same for period and then I go back to my file projection slowly but surely and I then I just V look up and like I did in my previous video I V look up the week number and the the the year so it's a concatenation between these two check my previous video I explained that slowly and you can just have the F ERS you can see that there is something that doesn't make sense and we do have F ERS in the past which is not cool cool so that mean like this for example in this specific week which is in the past we are still waiting for orders that's the what the estimated delory date is in the past so we have we need to clean orders we're going to do that in the in the next module or to clean and make sure everything is uh is great in the system but all these products all they will never come all their Del delivery date is not up to date in the system okay and then we do have much more here uh with all the F ERS and plan ERS coming so we have this information and now for the forast talk we can simply have this formula so what all this formula is working we we're going to say okay my next week so I'm going to start from this week it would be much easier to understand from this okay so my stock my stock forecast inventory projection will be for next week the my my inventory of this week of the my the week I have the the information for my Value Plus what is coming next week in terms of f orders and plan orders minus my forecast and what what did we plan to to sell the next week and it's important you see it's forecast cost price not Sal Price once again I repeat because I did this mistake multiple times as well you don't want to use the sales price because the the inventory has a valuation in cost price not sales price okay so that's a very simple formula you just need to have the right information and if you have an error that's my formula if you have an error I'm just using uh the value of my stock before okay so you see you have the same information here because it's in the past and in the future I have my inventory projection okay is that clear cool so we're going to add this forecasting stock in My Graph T and my value is this one cool so now we do have we do have this and once again you have an issue we don't see the forecasts so we can move this one up there we go so now we have this and what is missing is the plan orders and fame orders so we can add few ERS like we did before and plan ERS there we go now we do have this graph again and we have the oh but we have the same problem before we need to switch to two axes so we're going to click on this select data no it's not that change charge type there we go [Music] combo and why do we want this one we don't want cluster wait I'm going to S this to this I want to have this one cumulative it's better stack column then they are not next each other they at the top there we go beautiful and now we have a graph ready to go you can change the color to Red etc etc all right so that's it for the what is missing now is the target I'm going to stop for this episode but because that's a long one like the the one before we have the graph what is missing now is how to define the stock Target we're going to see that in the next episod
in this episode we're going to talk about how to define stock targets so you see you can see the yellow line and that will help you to see okay how we good or do you have too much inventory so we go back once again to the projection we are almost done now we do have we need to define a stock Target right and you can see stock Target plus 5% so you have two ways to define a stock Target for your company I feel like this is very useful especially for big companies and when you you want to to track per week or per month are we above or are we below I do feel that this is a work that you should do with your CFO Financial Officer uh maybe you are the the CFO following my course so thank you for that but if you're not I do feel like this is a very important so for the inventory we need to Define first of all what will be the the average inventory so what is important in terms of cash flow is not what is the inventory not only at the end of the year but what was the average during the the full year because you're going to pay it's like to have to pay an interest every year for your the cost of money for the storage and um what is important is okay what will be at the end but what would be the average for example of all your forecast of your stock sorry inventory per day or per month or per week so in this specific example the average is 65 million doar per average and that will be uh that you're going to pay to the bank if you need to Finance if you don't have a positive cash flow with your customer so how to define a Target I'm going to I'm going to do a very simple way we say okay what was the inventory last year okay it was x million dollars and this year we're going to grow by 5% so I was saying before that be always careful it's always much easier to grow in sales than inventory you should not grow more inventory than sales unless you are opening a new distribution center for example when you move especially from one to two distribution Center the impact for inventory is massive so it's almost impossible not to have to have a less uh to reduce impact of inventory because of minimum order of quantity lot size complexity etc etc but I like to have this idea of uh you grow twice faster than your inventory that's why you get more efficient and your what is inan is not the value but it's also the the stock term so to Define that you have multiple way you can use once again you could do a seasonality where I'm going to do I'm going to do a very simple seasonality of my inventory so in my stock Target here I'm going to keep keep one example I'm doing my the average of my inventory two weeks before last year two weeks after and the current week to have something like Smooth okay like we did something let's go to zero I'm going to put zero first so that was my stock last year okay you got me and let's say say you don't want to grow by anything so I'm that's why I put zero now I'm going to add this one okay it didn't didn't work why because I was wrong that's the value that I want okay it's okay you see I'm not perfect either with Excel have to be patient like you there we go so you see we have the the blue one is like the seasonality before I like to do it for inventory because you always have up and down it's better if you use the average for the last maybe three or four last year like we did in the professional level and we're going to do seasonality again in this level but I feel like this is something very uh very useful to have something smooth and then you can apply a gross on this so in this specific case I'm going to go to 5% and that will give you an idea okay what will be the inventory you can also at a global level for example when I was working with the cat we were talking about like hundred of millions and billions of inventory and in this specific case we were adjusting per per week manually one for example with very specific events etc etc so that's a good way to do it so you just apply I'm just doing the average of my inventory last year and go back to the formula multiply by one plus the gross it could be a negative grow gr if your company is declining or if you really want to improve your inventory and what also is important is to compare the Gap so what is the gap versus your inventory projection so you can see like per week what is the difference of your stock Target and the grow as well you can see that we're growing really fast and the Gap is massive we are supposed to have 54 millions and we have 73 millions and also to see what is the gap average total per year so you can see like my average inventory for the full year is 57 once my forast is 65 which is a lot and for the inventory we don't s per week we always do the average because this is what what is in average your is like to being like in less than zero in your bank account what is your average perer okay I'm minus $2,000 per per year annually and you that's the interest you will pay on the annual rate for from from your bank I don't wish you to be to be less than zero on your bank account of course all right so this is the stock Target and I did the same calculation for yet to date you can check my previous video with sales projection how to calculate that but I'm using the this time is not the Su if but the average if and I just want to compare what is the average only of this period so it will be 60 63.2 Millions versus my target Target here 6 56 million to see okay what will be my um the difference in terms of growth and my the difference versus my budget so you can see like globally we are growing by 20% I'm 8.3 Millions with my inventory projection above but since the beginning of this year I'm already at 8.3 it's a very close number which is a lot and it's more than 12% than my budget which is like it's a big problem that we need to fix that with reducing the focus and FM orders okay so we're going to add this curve in the F in the focus here it's not the focus it's the target I'm going to the Target stock Target great I know my screen is moving is moving a bit it's one of the most comp video to be honest but if you understand my principle it's it's enough for today and now you have your stock Target and you can see every week what is the situation and the situation is is getting the the biggest is the gap between the the curve of the Target and your inventory low or down because if you are too low it probably means as well you don't have enough orders and stock coming and you will be probably in out of stock if you don't do it properly so I don't wish you to be too low as well you need to be as close as possible from your target if you define a good Target all right so we do have this target that's amazing another way to define a Target is not in percentage of gross you could be in stock turn in inventory turn number of days and for that I just wanted to show you the the stock turn just to conclude with this I know it's a lot but it's a good way it's the expert level so I want you to push you to the the expert level and what is the stock turn you know the formula so we're going to divide what is the forecast by the for the forecast or the Sal this is in the past is the Sal but in this one we use the cost price again it's very important to compare Apple with apple I already said that but it's very important you cannot divide by sales price and you can see what is the the inventory turnover or the stock turn this is the same per week based on your forecast as well you can also we can also redefine what will be your Target sales in C price for that what I'm doing is you have yourself Target gross per week and I just use my sales in cost price and I just add the percentage okay so that will give me what is my target selling cost price and thanks to that I can have my stock turn Target as well and how do you calculate my stock turn Target you just divide your target your stock Target divided by your Target sales and I will give you your stock turn Target for this year and the stock Target for this year will be 137 days so that's that's your Target and you are planning to do 151 days which is much more so my Gap will be 15 days based on the current projection I can tell you this is wrong why this is wrong because my forecast is way too high if I go back to my dashboard is say okay this projection is based on a super like gross like plus 40 30 gross for the next few weeks coming and I don't believe it's going to happen so it's going to be even worse uh than that and the Gap will probably increase if I go back to my projection so if I only check my year to dat without considering the forecast just what happened in the past the Gap is more than 28 21 days of invent inventory turnover which is a lot okay so 155 is my year to date and 175 is my the what should be my target based on plus 5% of inventory all right so what you could do as well you could also play with this number to say okay I my this year I want to have 130 days so you could say no I want to have 130 days so I need to grow my inventory by 0% and then that will be another way to recalculate you could also have a stock Target manually per per week but this is more complex but I like to use between the percentage of gross of your inventory and what will be the consequence in terms of inventory turnover for the full year and that will be something very useful I like to play with these two it's always about value and also inventory turnover because if you are growing by plus 50% of course you can increase the value of your inventory so I like to combine this two but for this specific one I'm going to go back to 5% of targets and I think we're good now so we do have the inventory projection the stock gross y today is 18% my target is 5% for the full year the forecast for the full year is plus 20 which is bad and my stock Gap is positive plus 8 million so in the next the idea of this two video three episode where really to give you a full picture what is my situation in terms of demand sales forecast and inventory and the situation is not great and that's why they called me to fix that but the first step was to have visibility and that that's why I've done this graph I know in the next episode and we're going to finish this dashboard and then we're going to really focus on very simple actions to improve your inventory level and service
in this episode we're going to talk about the dashboard again so this is not the first time I'm creating a dashboard please go back to the foundation level first and then the the professional level because I don't want to repeat too much because I really want now to optimize the inventory with you but it's important to have a dashboard so once again uh we're going to do it quickly and what we want we want to have all the kpis we want the graphing quantities and values we want to have the top 10 we want to have inventory graph inventory turnover ABC XY Z and also update the dashboard so the dashboard is the same format the main difference in this one is that I'm using po queries but it doesn't change much for the creation of the dashboard we do have one base this base we're going to create um we have a pivot table insert pivot table and this pivot table we have multiple pivot in this tab and this P are going to generate graph right so I've done that multiple times before I'm not going to repeat all all of this you have the ABC analysis classification we have the thison stock what what we're going to do we're going to do this again we're going I want to see what will be my inventory value for XY Z and my avability my stockt etc etc so let's do one like this I'm going to copy this one I'm going to copy this one yep can try with me and like this kind of graph so I want to have my abc abc or you don't know you just do this then X Y we're going to use the focus one great and now it's good to see like for analysis it's good to see for example how many items right VOA Lei Lami means friend in French right it's not there is no French quiz at the end no is no pressure so you can see the number of items I like to play with these numbers to analyze first you can put it into number of percentage of ground total so you can see how many item we already know that it's good to to have like a synthesis of this I like to see for example what will be the inventory value we're going to use only the one from the warehouse boom and for that I'm going to do [Music] USD so you can see the repetition of inventory for that right I'm not going to take the the inventory value from my SES multiple sites because I feel that we're going to do that later it's more about inventory distribution all right so I'm going to do know this in percentage I feel like it's more useful in percentage great and let's do it for stock turn as well I like stock stock turn stock turn okay cool good job so I have this kind of analysis it's good to see okay what is the the inventory stock turn where where is my stock so most of my stock is coming from my this this uncertain product which is not a surprise um in terms of stock turn the the see are the worst obviously and if I what would be interesting is to see what is the item stue and I just want to focus on my active code and you will see like okay it's 365 for my CZ code and they are this is most of my item code they represent 71% of my code okay so you have all this information I did multiple report before I did also the multiple like you can you can have a look is good for analysis I like to analyze I'm going to go back to analysis in my in my last episode but what is important is to have the the most important information so we do have availability we have inventory accuracy we have the percentage of disc discontin stock I've done that in my previous modules checked that before we have the current inventory return we do have the sales projection which is great to see that we are we have way too high focus in the in the system right now my inventory projection with my Gap so we need to cancel orders we're going to do that in the next episode we have the stock turn per like this per brand and we can see that okay Brand number three is 282 days one Brand number four is 97 so we need to focus on this brand we have the avability which is not good in this one ABC and a is really low so we're going to focus on that the field rate the avability per brand and we also have the top 10 Stock and sales keep in mind that you can display top 10 like this in stock and it's always good to see the top 10 always is so the top 10 is 1.1 million you see the stock turn is terrible for most of them except these two and this one we need to we need a clear action plan to improve the situation of this one and the discontinued one as well so the top 10 in stock top 10 in sales I've done that in the creation of the dashboard in the foundation level please check if you if you want to do it again and then we do have the supply reports and top 50 ERS I'm going to get back to Safety stock calculation after but it's good to have the same report that we had uh before to say okay what is the main what is the most critical suppliers how much stock do we need to order etc etc and I will do probably so you can do it in sales so this is a no we do it in stock value and you can see the stock turn but you can also drill down by other value if you go like this you do like more s options and you can Dr down by dollar to and you will see that China is the number one okay so we do have all of this information we have segment again so the segment with it report connection to all my pivot table like before and now we have a beautiful dashboard with all this information you could also add this XY Z repetition I just don't feel it's good looking as so I keep it I like to keep it in another tab but you could also copy and paste this one for example this one to see What will what will be the you can try here maybe nice just do what you feel what feels right for you okay and then now we are good with that and to update this file so first of all you need to replace the file so what you can do let's say you have this sales U up you have this sales file coming from your Erp your stock someone needs to update this manually I mean not manually extract from the system it could be a CS CSV file you could also confirm parer connect directly to sap for example but it's much more complex so I'm not doing to do that but let's say you replace directly the the sales file and let's remove this one delete yes and very important to keep the same exact same name great and you do the same for Sal stock the most important information you have to update like orders maybe not the price but definitely the stock the sales and uh all your the Caps you need and when when it's done you just press data refresh all and you see on the r we're going to update everything like in few seconds which is very convenient you can have your te you do that on Monday morning when you arrive you can do it every day if you need just be careful to update in the same time the sales and the stock otherwise you it won't make sense if you have your you update your stock once a week and your sales every day and boom and now you're ready for that perfect just make sure so you have in the formula automatic calculation if not just save and you're ready to to go if you sometimes the pivot table don't refresh you can just refresh like this just to make sure but most of the time it's okay I know you're ready to work and uh analyze your data so in my next video we're going to start analyzing and then I'm we're going to start optimizing seriously the inventory
in this video we're going to talk about that so we've done all this dashboard I'm going to put this check great now we we we've done 26% of the job we're getting closer the next one is to is dashboard analysis and then yes we're going to start going straight to the point to uh to optimization but it's good to to see okay what is the direction so we've done that a bit before but I I just wanted to go back quickly what is the most important when you have this kind of file and you have now all the foundation and all the visibility to do your job as a consultant as a supply CH manager or as a supply sh director yes this is boring yes it takes time to create this file maybe few hours maybe few days if you don't have all the information but even if you don't have all the information now that you will see the next will be so easy so the first time is say okay what what is what is my priority my priority is always around service and inventory level right so what I'm going to do first I can see like especially my the the avability of my aode is not great so this is my PR priority number one is to make sure I have I improve the service of my aod number one number two I have way too much stock because of my forecast we're going to have to redu the forecast I can see that clearly we've done that before and have too much orders that I will have to canel as fast as possible because my focus is to away I have too much stock coming and I'm going to explode my cash flow because of that so we need to really focus on the biggest orders to can sell also the biggest volume and for that what we're going to do we're going to go back to the base and I it's good to have the micro level and then the micro you have the micro level from this and also from the top U top top 10 stock sales and also you can focus per suppliers and per brand but then it's quite easy to go directly into the base and in the base first of all say okay my priority is a Cod for I want to remove this filter so in this file you have all the information you need to go straight to the point so we go to a Cod and we go to zero so this is your priority your team has to do something quickly in the action plan we're going to get stuck and just really quick but just this is your number one priority like okay you need to fix this how many items are we talking about we're talking about nine items out of stock this is your number in priority okay second one will be if I go back to my 45 steps we say okay focus on your shortage A and B C this is obvious but most of the time we get we we lose focus and we go back to meetings email blah blah blah with marketing but at the end you need to focus on that so you start with a and then you focus on b b you don't have that much but it's good to add all of them and really focus on that and then I'm going to explain to you what you have to do in terms of orders uh forecast etc etc but this one they have no stock today right and few of them they have no orders as well the second step is to focus on your where is my list sorry expert to focus on your top 50 inventory in values from the top okay so we're going to do that now I'm going to check now and in my base I'm going to do I'm going to remove this and the main focus right now is the warehouse so we're going to do largest to smallest cool if it's getting too slow you just go back to manual calculation in your Excel formula and you can go to calculate manual okay and your main focus if you want to reduce your inventory is from this list okay and what you could do as well is you say Okay I want to do this but I want to have my stock turn greater than larger than let's keep it simple 300 which is a big number but that's something important now let's do 200 and this is your main priority and your number one priority in terms of inventory is the the item number eight then the item number one then the item number three always go this direction ction never like randomly or blah blah blah you need to focus on the biggest value if you improve by 10% item number eight you're going to save $100,000 if you improve this one you will only improve by $9,000 so you will have 10 times more efficiency in your performance if you start from the most important one that's a really ABC Paro Focus but this is how I get most of my result because I was always focusing on the most important items suppliers customers in my life okay so you start from this and then I'm going to explain to you in the next episode what are the different actions but this is your main your main focus for me and most you have a lot of product that are discontinued today so I'm going to also to talk explain to you what to do what are the different actions to clean your stock and improve your inventory level all right so it's very down to us but if I go back to defining my main priorities I would definitely say that we have we have a problem with a codes shortage in a codes we need to fix that as soon as possible we have way too much inventory of discontinued stock that we need to clean we have too our forecasts are way too high based on on this dashboard we are focusing way too high so we need to reduce this forecast and we also need to consel as many orders as we can because we're going to kill the cash flow that's the priority in a glance just by by analyzing these dashboards in only a few minutes if you send me this dashboard because you have also most of you you have a private videos with me like for analysis I can tell you in a 5 minutes what's going on and what are the main priority for your business to improve your performance very very quickly and that's what we're going to do in the next episode I hope you excited you don't necessarily to have all this information from this dashboard but at least having this base will give you so much visibility that it will be much easier for you to improve your economic performance and also to boost your career because it will be much faster and you will have a clear picture of what's going on in your perameters you know if you're a demand planner or responsible for your sulation so thank you and now let's get into it and clean all this talk and improve this service
okay so now we've done all the reporting the dashboards and the data consideration that was the boring part and now we have the easy and efficient part and you will see I will have very no it was long before but now I'm going to go straight to the point with like a concrete action to really improve your inventory quickly and I'm going to go very simple and straight to the point because this is critical to keep it simple because you want to have shortterm gains so on the right you can see we do have short-term gains and we're going to focus on that first and even if it's maybe too obvious for you please double check and make sure that all your team is checking what I'm going to say the first one is okay we said before we have way too much stock we need to reduce the inventory by 10 15% at least and the first one is order constellation for discontinued items this is a very basic action but I can tell you that many companies they don't check this frequently so what we're going to do we go we go to the file we go to discontinued items and now we go to the right and you can see that we have Transit orders which is not cool so we're going to to go to you can go to quantity we select all except blank and all of these products so we are talking about $2 million these products are discontinued and they still have orders okay that firm orders and we also have so we have 2 point a so in this one the action will be try to because it's already F orders cancel orders and you press controll enter boom you need to cancel this one you do this for I go back to this so you see in this file I can see quickly in a glance what in like in one second okay what what's happening and most of the time I can tell you when I was SU manager I was checking with my my demand plan I ah yeah I forgot to disable it could be in your sap Erp as400 you forgot to disable the the statue or the automatic replenishment because of that you will get stocks that you will never sell and you will have to destroy or maybe do a massive promotion for that so you do this for FM orders first then you remove and you do it for oop sorry discontin stock and let's see what do we have we have these two as well okay so that's a very simple action but so important we're going to save something more than 2 million maybe maybe even if we only can 30% of this value it will be $600,000 that we're going to save immediately for the company so that will be the main first action for that so canel F orders yes canell plan orders yes and also it's important that for all these products you need to disable the forecast and the replenishment so if you go back to this we do have I go back to I go back to my f ERS first sorry okay and I go to my okay so for all these products I want to make sure that there is no more forecast on the left you see for most of these prods I do have forecast so I need to disable all these products to avoid to have any forecast and because they are discontinued they will also reduce because you also have a lot of products that they have forecast but we are not really selling them anymore or you don't have orders that's why most of the time as well the sales production is higher because you have a lot of like obsolete products with forecast but we don't buy products for them okay so that's very basic one again I'm going to say basic basic of many many times the next few episode because this is critical that you do that and you Al you can also say like for this one action two disable forecast okay so you have two actions I would recommend that you do it immediately you send it to your demand planning team or if you the Dem plan you do it immediately but if you are a manager you can add this colum actions to to keep in mind what you have to do per item so that it for this first step we're going to go back to the 45 set this is done and let's let's check the next one with um uh the the how to reduce discontinued item with stock value
okay the next one is to reduce the the value of stock of discontinued items so for that what we're going to do we're going to go to the base again alwayss and the idea first you clean you canell the orders now we go back to only discontinued stock keep in mind we have 10% of this continued items just in the world and we also have in the the store 10% of the value is uh is like this and the total value is $6 million that's a lot what we're going to do now I see it's only in the world then we have in the in all the the sites so if I go back to my base the total value of my stock is like six six million in the world and eight Millions including the all the multiple sites that we have that we're Distributing okay so we we're going to focus on the on the warehouse first because this is where we have an action but you could also focus on this one and what we're going to do now I'm going remove this I'm going to go back to the inventory turnover let's say if you only have like 40 days of inventory turnover it's okay I don't see any emergency for example this one uh you do have I mean in the past you based on the forecast you're supposed to sell it fast or maybe yeah maybe you don't have many for example this one you have in stock quantity you have 340 quantities you are selling you are selling like 30 you sold just last week 33 and you you still have a forecast for that and you the last four you 112 So you if you keep selling this one I don't think this is one of the main concern that's why I will use I will use this one I will say okay let's filter greater than let's start simple with more than 200 100 days okay so all of this one and then you can see you can use okay this is based only the stock based on the past sales this is forecast and sales and this is only forecast you can see that most of them they don't look great and this that will be your main focus what you're going to do next you're going to also drill down there make sure that it's always largest to smallest and then you have multiple way to uh improve the inventory of these products if I go back to my 45 steps the first one is to identify this one so that that's what we did I recommend to start very high like 200 300 and obviously if you if you are doing like a if you're in the Agro business with food you will be probably more 15 than 200 it really depends on what is the average of your company but keep in mind that for this specific company the average is under 45 so I will not I will start quite high and make sure that you really focus first on the the worst uh inventory turnover product always starting from the top from the main value because you don't want to waste too much time on this you know when you have only $700 don't spend one hour with your sales see what what will be the promotion for this one keep it very very simple okay so the first thing you have to do 45 steps in this one you can do a promotion if you work in retail you can do a promotion if you work in a factory that won't be easy but if work in a retail or distribution okay let's check the margin first and what you can do you can you can do it all one by one so I suggest like if you have like a product with like $600,000 you could we could be 6,000 600,000 we we will have the same but according to the average value of stock per item in this specific one you could really spend like one hour just on one prod because if you reduce by 50% this item you will you will save your you will reduce your inventory by $300,000 which is a lot but so you could also check the margin so let's say okay I'm going to do a promotion greater than 0.2 all these products have more than 20% margin so they say okay these products I'm going to promote them so I'm going to go back to my actions and what I'm going to do I'm going to do this one has a lot t t t t and I we do promotion and you can just say Okay minus 20 potion Pro you can just say promotion control enter boom all right and this one promotion then you can Define you could say okay we have more than 20 20% I'm going to at least 20% of promotion 30% if you if you can accept negative margin I will definitely go for negative margin uh if you have way too much talk but I would just add promotion that's the first step right done I'm very proud of you the second one is even before the first one if you are losing money I will really try to return to suppliers so there is no way to check in this file you need to ask to every single suppliers but maybe you can you have the information per suppliers and you can can see that okay we do have multiple suppliers I will focus on the main ones first especially Vietnam I do have one specific Taiwan so I will do a pivot table with my main maybe my main value per supplier in this continu stock we can do it now let's do it now don't be afraid let's do it now uh we can do from start from this I we already have a report so what what I'm going to do I will go to my uh dashboard here and you have your suppliers report and I will focus first on my main inventory I don't have it here okay I'm going to do it again I will check which one has the most discontinued Value stock statu and supper Tech and we done so that's the value per supplier and you can see that this one Morocco for example or let's do stock you can take from the world so globally but because it's in the world it's easier to send back if it's already in your retail or Distributors it will be much difficult to send back to the suppliers that's why I like to focus on this one first but if you can just check on the global so I would focus definitely you don't have time to check all the supplies but I would definitely focus on the this for example this the one above 5% so you contact them you give the list okay look you have a problem and that's in the in in many Industries this is completely okay to send by your products so you know like it's you can always try and see what happened it's always better than just to say no it's not possible the next step if you cannot promote or return to the supplier you can donate the product so I I was doing that a lot in the Cosmetic industry when we were close to the exper like not the expiration dat but like the the we had the last shipping date it's called last shipping date when we were like one week or even during the after the last shipping date for the distribution and the shipping Daye was most of the time at least six months of shelf life before expiration for this one I was doing a lot of donation for like Association ngos uh like people that cannot afford the Cosmetics or or any kind of products so this is one of the this is a better Sol solution than to destroy the product because when you most of the time when you have to destroy the product to put it in the bin is not free and first of all I don't feel uh very responsible to just um put away some some products with value I prefer to give it to someone and in most of the countries in the world for example in Australia I had to pay like a lot per the cost per ter was quite expensive to make sure it was recycled and it was use in a in in a clean way and recycle so that would be for me definitely the last step but before before that you have to make very sure like which one you want to focus first the one with more inventory return promotion then return to suppliers and donation and if this is the last chance you can just destroy the product so that's it for the how to reduce discontinued value I I'm going to keep improving your inventory in my next episode
okay so we're moving forward we reached 31% of the steps you see it's much easier after so what we did first we cleaned the the obsolete stock discontin stock this is the most important to start because it's already too late if you need to do any promotion that's something you really need to clean as fast as possible the next step is to uh to take to talk about the active items and what we're going to repeat the same task for active items but this is the second the second priority not the first one so what we're going to do do we're going to go to again to the base and the IDE is to really identify which items with a very long like inventory return over we should cancel the orders so let's go back to the base we go to active this one this time great and this time I'm going to go greater than 300 okay why 300 because we do have very long lead time sometimes so I feel like at least 300 is a good number you can see that we don't have if you want to make sure what we can do we can also like greater than for example 200 for this one okay you see we only have like super high inventory turnover items so we do have something like 200 items and these items Mo many of them we do have orders coming we have plan orders and we have open orders and the idea is to do exactly the same is to say okay let's try to cancel this orders so if you cannot cancel these orders because it's too late you can also postpone these orders because they're not obsolete stock so this time you can also ask toly look I need this products but maybe send it send it back to me for example the first one send it back to me in six months you could even share the cost of storage in the in the factory of your suppliers but this is critical for your inventory level we're talking about $4.7 million just for f orders that's a lot so I will do my best to cancel a postpone orders that will be my action so I will do [Music] cancel or postpone postone boom and I will do the same for the the plan orders it's much easier to consel plan orders so plan orders oh sorry no control Z great okay this time we go to plan orders and this time we have $1 million of plan so this one can be canell immediately because they're not they're only plan they're not confirmed by the player so you're going to save $1 million of inventory like this boom so we're gonna do this t t up he voila one more to so we have all of this to cancel right T and VOA so this is that was the step so you're going to identify which one cancel or postpone we do the same for plan orders and something also important if you have orders in the system is probably because you have you had an issue with your replenishment or it was a manual order if I go back to my let's go back to this yeah if I go back to my list you need to ask yourself why so in my like we're going to recalculate the Safety stock and the re point but I don't have anything to order obviously but why why do I have all these orders what happened and that's a big problem because you don't want to see like I'm very curious to understand why sometimes it's good to really uh take maybe one or two example why these products have as a plan order like or these products has 48 quantities as a plan order so take probably I would always take the biggest order say why this one has a plan order 2,700,000 quality one we already have like 300 um 300 days of inventory so be very aware with that and usually when you take three or four example you will understand the root cause for all most of your problems of inventory Overstock or shortage in the system but in the short like the shortterm action will be to cancel and the midterm will be to review your parameters okay so that's very very simple one more time it's so efficient we we we can save we we could save like something like two or three million just by checking this in a glance and if you don't do it you will you will forget about it and you will wake up when it's too late when you get all these millions of dollars of inventory in your Warehouse or factory
the next step is so we did cancel the orders now we're going to try to reduce the inventory of item with high stock turn so what we're going to do we're going to do the same then for thison stock so we're going to go back to my base see it's like it's very logical that's why I love Inventory management once you have visibility it's super simple go back to this I do the same filter greater than 300 you can do the same for that if you want and once again the value of your filter depends on your average if you're R is 50 you may check above 100 or 150 if you a is 300 maybe you can check above 400 Days okay very important so now we have all these products and what we're going to try to do is so we have mple steps you can promote or discount this product so what we can do we can do the same if your marketing team is okay with that at least you can ask for it so we're going to do that and say okay if my margin is greater than 0.2 So 20% this one because I have way too much we are talking about $9.2 million and it will be great to reduce Maybe by 10% at least so why we could do is to promote this one so we we can ask and then check you can send an email or during your meeting you can explain okay we have more than one year stock of these products we need to do something okay T I hold control key to select multiple okay we have a lot anyway I don't have to just to show you the the process but I don't need to keep it that clean for me it's just for you okay we do it t t t and you can write promotion control enter B okay so we do have this that's the first step you can do so we need to identify that was super fast promotion for produ more than 20% in this specific case return to supplier it was the same explanation than before try to return to suppliers inventory if you feel like you really need cash flow explained that before good luck good luck with that but you always always try at least once and there is a new Step it's called extend the duration in the catalog or consider a new product prods something very important when I was working in the fashion industry for example we tend to have too many products and we didn't even sell like 20% of the the current products that we have the new one coming and that's something I really recommend to think about if you for example let's let's say that you have one product like this one for example item number eight and it's supposed to maybe if you it's supposed to be we supposed to have a new one maybe been six months I would say I would talk to my product team or marketing team to say guys we we need to extend one more of this products because we are not selling these products enough and we still have something like two or three years of inventory so the strategy would be okay we're going to sell it maybe for the next season until 200 I don't know whatever and also it's very important if you extend the duration of one produ to canel the new one or to at least have an an agreement to maybe at least reduce the quantity of the new one because most of the time when we manage old products and new products we tend to have too much of both of these products and at the end we do massive promotions and that's where we we lose a lot of profits and uh and that's why I'm I'm giving you this example so it's better if you have in the in this file it's even easier if you have like a clear description of where is the new one where is the old one and if you already have as as well the starting date and the ending date that's something you could add in addition to your file to have even more visibility and to take more actions quickly to improve the inventory of this active code with way too much inventory turnover okay so that's another step and I'm going to see you for the next video
Next Step we're going to check the item blocked what are the item blocks are the the products that you are supposed to sell but you're not really selling them because there is a problem and we're going to we're going to do multiple checks to make sure that there is no problem in the supply chain I can tell you that many companies they think everything is working but at the end there is no for example for a and b because you you could have like a parameters which is wrong the forast missing like an an inventory issues uh IT issues logistic issues and at the end you think everything is perfect but when you go to your store to your factory there is no product so we we have this safety check that I really recommend to do the first one and this is not the first time I'm talking about it let's go back to the base we're going to check the shortage for A and B codes so let's go back to A and B this is the most important check I feel A and B oops there we go and we're going to check which one are out of stock zero great and now we're going to what we going to check if does any items as another coming so we're going to check only this so all of these item they don't have any stock right they have zero stock zero in the warehouse and we don't have any orders so there is a problem so oh we just forgot to raise the orders or there is a problem with the system so that's why you you really need to check this of course because I did my own calculation I do feel like yeah we need to we need to order all of these quantities but this is like something really really urgent so we're going to do like urgent orders but sometimes you can also find that find out that oh I forgot but my my item cost for example is discontinued or there is something not working in the system or my stock is equal to zero so it's very very important that you understand first make sure that do you have any orders for these products and if you don't have any orders try to understand what's happening and then if you have any orders you need to get yourent orders as soon as possible because my this is coming from my Excel spreadsheet but sometimes you working with an IP as well and you say okay we need to we need to raise 300,000 USD for this products but maybe in myp there is no orders recommendation so make sure you check this first this is the number one and this is the most important one the second one is check item with ey forast and stock without any sales the last few weeks so let's go back to the base and this this time we're going to check my products with no sales the last four weeks for example so let's check zero right and and let's say that I'm going to check the one with inventory because maybe it was the produ was out of stock so stock quantity greater than for example 50 cool and now I'm going to check the products with more than for example for the last four week greater than I plan to sell more than 100 quantities you can of course I just like before you always start with like large numbers and then you can reduce when you want to optimize okay so a few of these products are new products that's why we're not selling them so we're going to remove the new ones and I do feel I want to to remove as well the discontinu ones okay so this products as you can see we do have stock in the warehouse we are not selling them for the last four weeks zero and we do have forecast at least more than 100 quantities for the next four weeks which is which is weird right so that's why you want to make sure that okay what's going on with this products maybe the the suppliers forgot to order maybe there is something not activated with your distribution Network maybe there is an night issues maybe there is a pricing uh there is a price missing in the system but at the end we do not have uh we have a problem that we need to fix and that's part of what we call check the these kind of products that we need to to have in the system most of the time I remember for example when I was working for this big retail company we had to activate um we had to check one box to make this products like available for the the the distribut the Distributors and if you were not checking this box it wasn't working so it was just a very simple parameters in sap that it's an ARP and because it was not done we were like just losing millions of dollars because of that so that's a safety check and you can all you can see that the the potential what we we are probably losing probably like two three four $400,000 just because of this product if you multiply this by the average price just in terms of quantity we are losing what is the S 3,200 and if you multiply by the average price we're losing something like yeah 100 or $200,000 because these products are not moving all right so that's the check I wanted to talk about the next one will be check if your it inventory is correct as well if you feel like okay I don't understand I'm selling I'm supposed to sell my products let's go back to this maybe the problem of this is maybe your inventory is not correct okay you see you have 600 units for example for this one but at the end when you go to the world so the factory there is no products that's why you are not selling them or you're not consuming them if you work for a factory so make sure you can maybe send a team to say okay double check these products that will be one of my actions and I will like check check block and stock so I'm going to ask to my team okay make sure that double check if there is no block in the system and also make sure that the the stock is correct in in in it we're going to go back to stock Tech before and we already have the the forecast accuracy as well if you open this the last I remember that the last time we did inventory Gap the inventory accuracy was 100% so I mean from the last inventory check it was not the case but let's check again only for this 10 15 items the next step is okay so we done this one good job it's very basic but so important check if there is no supply problem so I was talking about this before if maybe the stock is blocked maybe there there is a quality issues that's why we cannot Supply because sometime like when I was working for the Cosmetic or food industry you receive a message from player that say look we may have an issue with this probably should just block it because we are not sure we need to check with the the regulation or we need to do test with the quality of the products or maybe the packaging so that's something you have to be very aware and be aware of also all the possibilities what are all the possibilities to block one item and make it very clear for all your team and also check if there is no it problem or flow blocked that's something also very common that I can see and you can lose millions of dollars even like if you have a small company thousand of dollars just because there is one thing not correctly set up and the power of this base once again is you will really focus quickly of course you can go the smaller if you want you can go to less than no sorry you can go you check with this one first and then you can say no I'm going to 50 quantities and you will have even more products but always St from the top from the one with more quantities more volume more value and once you've done this then you go you can go smaller smaller so I'm I like to go micro to micro but start with the the biggest value because this is where you're going to lose more money okay okay so that's it for the DI 10 blockchain you can have also multiple other the process I really recommend you each time you find something wrong to Ed it in your checklist to make sure you don't miss the next time you're going to you're going to have this weekly checkup
all right Next Step we're going to check the late orders and see if we can cancel them the first thing to know to if you want to check if your orders are late you need to make sure that you have the correct lead time in your system so please make sure that you you check my professional level I was talking about lead time or to check the average lead time or to avoid also the outliers and not to to cap them with these kind of parameters in this one I'm going to just go back straight to the point you have your supplier lead time so make sure they are if we go to suppliers we do have the the average lead time just so make sure this is correct and then if we go back to the FM orders we have all these orders and we can see which one I first of all which one didn't arrive yet so all of these orders we are in week 41 now based on this data set all these ERS they were supposed to arrive but they didn't arrive yet so they were not booked at the warehouse or the factory so all of this we're talking about $1 million this one there is something wrong maybe they arrive and they maybe there is an IT problem maybe the suppliers never shipped the the products so what you can calculate as well once again is the delay what was the initial date the CDD the Contra contractual delivery date and what is the estimated delivery date this one are not correct because we're in the past so first of all at least you you should update to maybe 2,000 you should call your supplier or your the Fright company but at least you should move to This One automatically to the the current week if this is not the case and also you should also check okay maybe this product will never come right so I will update this first and then I will check if there is one of these orders that maybe I can canel in the past or in the future let's check this is just the delay so the delay is just the difference between your CDD and your add let's say if you have more than let's just take the the statue which is like late this is all my late order and maybe at one point you have if you have a contract with your supplyer you say look I was expecting this way before now you are 57 days late let's check this item if you don't need this stock maybe that's this is the time to cancel this order you say look it's like if you work with a supermarket or Walmart or Amazon if you are like even like four or five hours late they can they have the right to canel your orders and don't forget this right as well for your company because you you want the the stock in a specific date not only one the supplier is as time to ship for you right if I go back to my oops I lost my f orders this one of course if you need to start because this is a and you don't have much let's check this one so this one that's an aod not a good sign yeah in this specific case we do have so we can see this order we do need this time because we don't have much inventory inventory turnover so I will not cancel this one too bad but if you feel you can so you should check this for all your late orders and check if you need to so that's one example let's check another one maybe this one 69 days so you could cancel or you could return but you will not pay the price right it's all about negotiation this one yeah this this one as well we don't have much inventory again so I will not cancel this one that that would be a risk for your for your suppliers but you understand my process right so you have to do this job for all the late orders make sure like like this one for example 115 maybe we're going to find one you could also look up the stock turn on the right if you want to save time because my process is clearly not efficient this time see sometime you can always improve it right now you we don't have much talk of this one as well that's that will be we have we will probably do an F rate for this one F rate If the product is not too big because the suppliers is delayed and uh we have we will probably miss inventory very soon if you check how much so do we have we are selling 8 how much so do we have in the world we have three 132 in four weeks we're going to sell 300 and and we are not getting the stock for a very long time so we will be probably out of stock on this specific product okay so you have to to do that so first make sure you have the correctly time the system because otherwise you don't really know what is late or not late then you need to update orders with a delivery date in the past so that was all these specific orders this one because they're in the past and this is very important this is also where you can see in your dashboards when you go to your dashboard you can see that we do have we in week 41 and you can see that you have orders in week 40 $700,000 we do have even orders before 200,000 all of this is way before so you need to clean that check calculate delays per order we we've done that before and then you need to cancel unnecessary late orders if you can okay once again very basic but most of the companies they have like 1% 5% 10% of the orders with like delays are not correctly set up and that will completely mess up your inventory you could also if you really want to optimize your inventory you could also do the opposite I will increase I will add one more step um refuse refuse early delivery and what what I mean by that is you don't want to receive the stock one month before if you don't need it especially if you if you have a cash flow problem or if your Warehouse is full right so what you're going to do is what is early this time we're going to check early for example this one they're going to deliver 27 days before if you don't really need the stock so let's check this one maybe we're luy this time oops oops oops oops sorry all right so this one we we do have we have way enough stock we have 160 days and we are the the stock is com one month in advance so if it's not too late I will definitely ask to my supplier to slow down or to keep it in a like in a random storage if you feel like you're comfortable with that but you don't want to pay especially if you pay at the delivery you don't want to have your stock one month before especially if you are full okay so that's another step you can add in your process to make sure that you you really want to challenge your suppliers to deliver on time not before not after unless it's really urgent uh for you so that's another step we can include in the process and I'm going to divide by 227 because I have a new one for you so 38% of 38% of the the steps we are moving forward and I see you for another episode
Next Step we're going to reset Inventory management parameters so that's a very very powerful action I'm going to start with the story so I was suppan project manager in working for Deaton this big Spa Goods retail company and uh so I was working all these projects and one day they asked me okay Ed do you want to go to Brazil so I say yeah I want to go to Brazil so I went to Brazil for three years and basically they asked me at the beginning Ed can you just improve the the service and inventory situation because we have way too much stock and service is not great for our customers so I went to this stores and I was checking manually few items and I could see they had a lot of stock in the in the in the store and I when I was checking I could see that there had a lot of manual parameters so the the store could could put like a minimum like a re manual REO point or minimum value or minimum like kind of Safety stock it was minimaxi but manual because they were afraid of not having enough so every store was putting like manual orders and manual uh uh automatic like REO point and Safety stock in the every specific store so for example you could have an item who will need maybe two items per week and they will have 10 minimum as manual in the system so what I've done when I when I moved to Brazil I said look guys I feel like no one trust the system that's why we have way too many um parameters in addition we had a huge turnover so many people left the company and they also left manual parameters in the warehouse and everywhere and when I move to Brazil I say we're going to we going to reset all the manual parameters we're going to remove them and just leave the the automatic replenishment for now so I've done that and it was a huge impact because almost for like two weeks we had almost no volumes uh coming from the St because there that way too much manual parameters in in the stores so because of all these manual parameters they were like overstocking everything and because of Overstock we had also shortage on the on the other side for store that were not uh having the so much safety and manual stock and at the end sometimes if you feel like there is way too much manual things in your system I recommend that you just reset everything the impact can be import very important but make sure you also have something automatic to to make sure that you still Supply what you really need but sometimes I just do like okay let's just reset everything and start from zero again because it's it's it's a mess and we have way too much inventory it could be in your in in your in your stores in your factory or in your Warehouse okay so you could do it for any kind of manual parameters manual Safety stock stock coverage if you have like okay I want seven days of inventory REO point it could be also not delays but lead time lead time make sure like you you go back when I say reset don't put zero or blank if you put zero value and there is no automatic value it's going to be a mess but for example you can use this kind of Excel and say okay I'm going to remove all my previous one right all my for example if you talk we talk about Safety stock and you can say okay I'm going to I'm going to remove all my safety St because it was from John or David or Susana we put put it manually it was two or three years ago and there is no correlation between the Safety stock value and the sales today and we going to just upload what we have from this Excel spreadsheet this is not perfect but you will be probably much better than it was before okay so that's a very very powerful tool you could also reset the calendar and other frequency if you feel that are not up to date as well so I'm going to check this box as well and you could also reset the replenishment or even the forecasting model that you were using so this is just IDs I would suggest that you first of all you make the list of okay what are the manual parameters that my team can use in the warehouse in the factory or in the Distribution Center or it could be in the the store store Network as well then you focus in one maybe you check maybe 10 or 15 examples to make sure that okay what is the impact of these manual parameters and if you see that it's obvious that you have way too much talk or maybe not enough because it could be also something that is limiting your supply chain you just reset all of them maybe per group of products or specific category first you see the impact and if you see that the impact is positive in terms of service and inventory you duplicate for to more categories more stores or more Factory this is one for me this is one of the most efficient way to to clean your house and start from like with clean Foundation to optimize your parameters in thecat long after this res we redu by 15% the volume of inventory in the country and that was an amazing performance just in like few hours it was a bit messy for the W because with the volume was very very low for two weeks and we didn't plan for this so that was one of my mistake was the the lack of communication because I was not sure about the impact but at the end we save we save a lot of cash flow and Profit just by making this decision so try first in the small with a small parameters of group of products and then if you feel like it's working just duplicate
Next Step we're going to talk about economic qualities we've done that before in the professional level so I'm not I'm not going back to all the theory and the calculation I'm going to go really fast only maybe three minutes uh with a different example and also talk about the difference between mq minimum order of quantity and EQ okay so we need to calculate the holding cost the transaction cost and then the economic order quantity if you don't have it it's always good to challenge um this information versus the one you have in your system I'm using the same this is the same calculation with the purch purchasing price that will be the dynamic per products you have the annual cost the cost of money blah blah blah you know all of this and at the end we have 12.7% for this specific example and the transaction cost for this company is a bit higher is like something like $50 check my previous video in the professional module right so we do have what we're going to use we're going to use for the olding cost the percentage 12.7 and for the transaction cost it will be $50 and I can tell you most of the company they don't really challenge that they don't even have this um so we have one example with 400 units but what is important is in your base we have the EQ and the EQ will be the 12.7% and the 51 we're going to apply this multiply by the cost price and for the transaction cost it will be the same price for that once again if you feel that you have a different holding cost per type of product if you have like products with like more promotions or like more expensive storage like big like volume product with big volume that you need to pay more you can also update this holding cost according to the category of your products keep it simple it's it's okay if it's not perfect at the end if it's like 12.1 or 12.7 it's not a big deal but if you feel you have a huge difference and for example like if you have a huge storage cost or you have a massive promotion cost for a very specific group of product you can update that the transaction cost is the same but once again you can change if you want and at the end we do have the same formula with the EQ and I'm using this formula for the forecast of the next 52 weeks this time not the because we do have forecast so you can see forecast 52 weeks if you don't have forecast you can go back to the last um last 52 weeks volume in quantity so we do have the EQ and then it's interesting to check the a versus for example the minimum order quantity so the minimum order quantity is the minimum order from your supplier that would say you need to order minimum this quantity and if you see that is a big difference between these two that could be something like I'm going to get back to this into details and the calculation of this in the supplier module but like for example if you uh if you feel like okay I need to have um my economic a quantity is 1,700 and my minimum a of quantity for my Supply 10, there is a risk of Overstock because you will have way too much stock compared to what you need to optimize your holding cost of these specific products okay so this this is just a quick introduction I'm going to go back to this and estimate what will be the Overstock of your mq but EQ will help you to compare and see what would be the the optimal value when you you you send an order to your supplier okay so that's it for the the EQ I've been really fast because we we've done that before you can check my previous video for that and we're going to talk about the safety stock again in my next episode
in this episode I'm going to talk about safety stocks again yes this is important I've been talking a lot about Safety stock and the right method in the professional level so please make sure you go back to this episode if you jump directly into the expert level but in this one we're going to just apply the formulas we're going to do some check and optimization and you will see that this company has currently manual Safety stock and they're way too high and the IDE is really to compare them so the first step is to choose the right Safety stock method right so I've been talking this about this a lot we're going to keep the same formula so if I go back to the Safety stock method I'm going to keep the method number three uh I'm going to focus only my standard deviation on my demand and I'm going to we're going to use the average lead time okay for the standard deviation we already have the same tab so we're going to use the standard deviation from my last uh sales it will be better to use the demand than the sales to be honest but in this Cas if you have the demand in the right in the right format it will be better to use the demand than the sales sales is what you sell demand is what your customers asking for then for the lead time we do have the lead time from the supper tab okay so we do have the lead time here and we have the review perod don't forget to add the review per and we have a total time uh something I didn't really explain in the professional level you have the lead time plus the review period but if you use a fixed period for example if you order every once a week uh with the the EQ like with fixed quantity I recommend to divide the review period by two because you the review period okay you're going to order once a week but when you need stock statistically you you may need stock after one day of your last review or seven days after so I like to divide this by two if you don't feel comfortable you can also keep the full review period but this is um this is I recommend to avoid Overstock on the review period as well so we have the total lead time in this specific example I'm not using safety lead time per suppliers why because I don't have when I when I was working with this company I had not enough information to review uh the standard deviation of my different orders we only got the orders the F orders in the future except the one late but I I was not able to do the same job job that I did with my suppliers to classify in low medium high level of uncertainty so that was not enough but you see even if you don't have all the information it's okay so in this specific example the expert level I'm not going to classify but you could also do it manually you could say okay if you go to a customer and they don't have any like previous data for from the suppliers you could say okay let this is the list of my suppliers just give me three levels you trust them you don't trust them high medium or low and you could have the same logic of percentage you can use a manual safety lead time if you don't have much orders to analyze to Define this automatically okay so it's okay as a consultant I I'm not expecting to have everything perfect so I'm going to keep it very simple as I said before I'm going to get back to the method number three this method number three is the one I recommend most of the time because sometimes with the lead time if you don't have enough orders you could have very high standard deviation and you don't want to have too much Safety stock because of that so we go back to the file I'm going I I'm going fast but this is not the first time and then we do have like the um we do have the EQ we need also to have the target service level the target service level from my abc XYZ analysis I've done that as well in the professional level you have different classification a b c XY Z this time the only differ this time we're using XY Z analysis based on the forecast not on the demand deviation keep in mind before it was s now we're going to use this one and based on this we do have if I go to my Pivot base here we do have different Target service that we're going to link and then we're going to optimize them once again but we're going to start from this uh Focus because we we did that issues with the the service especially for aod so I really want to push the a because especially the more stable one so we do have this then we have the link table I'm repeating myself just to make sure and we have we have the target service based on the normal distribution so we do have the target service per per ABC right we do have the ABC Target service level XY Z then we do have the Z Safety stock and then we have the formula of the per item so we're going to say okay if the the item is discontinued than zero otherwise standard deviation of the demon multiply by the coefficient multiply by the square root of the lead time divided by seven Why seven once again because we were working per day and why we divide by seven because all my information are per week especially my standard deviation demand is per week so be careful don't forget to divide by seven okay so then we do have the recommended Safety stock the Safety stock value I'm going to multiply by the cost price and then what is interesting to see is okay this is a current Safety stock from my company so we did that we got this information from this tab we had the item code and the current Safety stock in the system you can see that these Safety stock are very like um really round up there is no like it's like R up numbers and usually when you see these kind of numbers it's a manual safety stck okay so that's why then it's very interesting to see okay what is my recommended Safety stock and what is oops and what is my current Safety stock and then what you can do you can create another colum because you don't want to change everything in the system first but you want to see okay what will be uh the difference between um the recommended and the current one and in terms of quantity but also in terms of value and what we can see in terms of quantity this is not dollars this is quantity we do have 257,000 quantity less versus the so the current one are much higher than the the recommended one automatic and in terms of value we are talking about 14 millions of variation between the the manual ones and they recommended one so it's very interesting to see that and then to really check maybe one or two first because you you don't want to upload everything first because the impact could be just by changing the Safety stock calculation minus 40 Millions it won't be instant because you have a lot of stock then you have minimum order quantity then you have a lot of like you have a lot of impact it's not only about the safety stock value but potentially at the end like after one year if you keep it for one year you will have like at least 10 millions of reduction of inventory uh because of that all right so we do have this and this information is very interesting to compare and maybe you say say no I'm going too far and you can readjust your uh Safety stock uh or your service Target service Target h for so we do have the safety variation and what you can do then you can filter largest to smallest okay largest no we're going to do so largest we with say you need to increase the Safety stock so my recommend it is um you will have to increase because the the current one is too low and what will be more interesting especially if you want to improve inventory will be smallest to largest and this time for example this one your recommended is 339 and your current SA stock is 7005 7,500 which is which is a huge variation we're talking about half half million dollars just for one product and then you can double check you can say okay but why is it so different what's happening in this uh with these products uh you can double check if the the average sales is correct um you could you could check also if it it makes sense to have that many quantities so let's check how many what is the in the stock recommendation I have 339 let's see the average sale for the last four weeks 339 let's open this so we do sell yeah we sold something like it's more something like five or six weeks of sales which is which makes makes sense for me but when we were talking about like the manual value was 7,000 units 7,500 and you can see that for the last uh the last 52 weeks we only sold 5,000 which doesn't make sense to have more than one year of Safety stock sales even for the forecast the forecast for the next 52 weeks is 4,000 units and the manual safety so was 7,000 which doesn't make sense anyway so that's why it's very it's very useful to have automatic value and probably someone put a value maybe at the beginning or because it was not interesting what was in the RP system but at the end just by updating this we're going to save more than $400,000 in this specific item so this is the the this is why I really recommend you to have everything to one one place and always to be able before updating to check few items to make sure that this is if it makes sense for you or not before like just updating uh all the the new recommendation of C stock so I recommend to check few of them maybe per group of product or maybe you start with the most important one also you will see like a few example like this one for example is discontinu and you still have Safety stock in the system this one is a very expensive very expensive products as you can see so it would be it will be useful maybe to disable this one to make sure you don't have any new orders coming etc etc so that's it for the safety stock we're going to on the next episode we're going to improve the what we call the target service level and go back to the REO point and finish to optimize this Safety stock and replenishment model
I just wanted to go back to the Safety stock in the ABC XYZ service Target service because I feel this is something important I got many questions from that what is the best way to optimize is it not to because you you may feel that this is too much change for your company if you just upload all these new parameters in once uh keep in mind that for this example where we we supposed to reduce our safety stock value by 14 Millions it's a lot because they had a lot of manual values and there were not like people really using like like methodologies to optimize that but still it could be a lot and before you do that you want to make sure that you do it correctly and that's why you can use the target service level also to adjust that and make sure you go step by step the first one is very important I'm going to get back to this you need to accept the risk or out of stock for low sales or maybe products with no profits or too much uncertainty so keep really this in mind in your checklist it's okay and if I go back to my base I like to see okay what will be the impact when I'm going to update my safety stock based on my target service level so we can do a pivot table from the to see what is the variation uh if I go back to my Pivot base let's take whatever this one I've done this in the professional level but I feel this is important to do it again just to make sure it's clear I want to see my a b c XY z x y forecast this time and what we can see so this I want to see my safety stock value boom so that's the one I have it's so easy because now I have it's so easy to to see the your the visibility and how to improve everything when you have your table in one base you I did also the same for the stock variation this is the one stock variation to see okay what will be the impact after implementing all of this of course if you upload all these new Safety stock it will it won't be immediate because you have a lot of minimum order quantity many of these products they already have stock today so it may takes one week one month 6 months even one or two years for specific items if they have too much stock but this is the potential of saving we have in this company but maybe you will say oh okay this is this is too much I need to go slower and you say yeah no problem if you want to go slow you have multiple solution you can increase the target service or you can increase the lad time but I will more I will focus more on the target Sav than lad time for example you say no no no I don't want to reduce the Safety stock of my ax even if for me like the Safety stock value in this company didn't make sense before it was way too manual but you could say no I want to go to 99 first and B by going to 99 let's refresh it was minus 1.1 million yeah there is no big change for this one or you could say no no I really I we really have huge problem of cash flow I need to reduce even more my C that product so say okay I'm going to go back my C that to 50% keep in mind when you have 50% for Target service with a normal distribution that means zero Safety stock because you have as much chance as a normal distribution you have as much chance to say to sell less than the average and more than the average okay so I go back to my Pivot base if I put 50% probably my sum of Safety stock value here we will go to zero so let's ref fresh boom we have zero so we save half million dollars in Safety stock but we will also accept to have more uh shortages with the the CZ products but if this if you in a critical situation I'm going to get back to this have a special bonus or to survive in terms of like if you have a cash flow crisis or if your de demand is dropping really fast that could be one of the solutions so I really encourage you to to adapt this target according to the you can see on the Safety stock on the impact on the variation versus the current value you have currently in the system and then you can readjust later you can you can um tune these parameters slowly but surely to go to the right direction if you really want to I keep in mind also if you really want to focus on inventory optimization I will focus I will be very careful on the Z Cod so I will reduce this one even more and um you could also reduce this one here I we go from see like this and this one I will go yeah I really don't like the C code by doing that my safety stock value will go to 4.7 to 3.6 so that that would be a much more aggressive approach I would really Focus my safety maybe I I could improve more this one it really depends on your your priorities if you want to focus more on I'm going to go back this you see there is no like you don't have to optimize everything at one point you will see the impact and you will adjust and I also recommend to always check few items to see what will be the impact on specific items that you really know and let's refresh again and now we have 4.2 millions of Safety stock which is like 14 almost 15% 15 Millions variation between before the last one okay so I'm going to go back to this ones because I feel this is safe to start and yeah that's it you have all these tools to to estimate the impact and then according to your strategy you will focus more on service or more on inventory and then when when you're ready for that you can go back to the base and you can say Okay always Focus From the biggest Safety stock variation and for this one for example for the top 30 you will say okay we really need to for example you could start from the main variation more than oh let's do this here sorry I'm moving fast say Okay I want to focus first of all on my less than in value 100 um 50,000 if my safety stock variation is more than minus 50,000 so all of these products that represents half almost more than half of the variation 8 Millions we're going to focus first to update this one so we you could send this to your team and you say okay this one is this item has many problems T and is discontinued as well so we should just cancel it but you understand my methodology like you go step by step it's like a a funel process micro to micro and we just update the safety St you can do it directly or you can I like to follow up with my team t t t review Safety Safety stock boom all right so you start with this one you check if it's okay then you go to the less than 50,000 and don't forget also you need to adjust you have the positive one and you have the negative one if you go to the other side large ones this one for example I would definitely increase this one as well okay just to give you an example increase safety t Okay boom especially the the biggest one in value okay so that's it for the adjustment you can review these parameters if you have any more question you can also send send these questions to us and will help you to adjust don't forget as well you can also adjust the categories if you feel that you don't have enough you really want to focus more on the the service of the product with less variation you could say no I want to move back to 40 so I will have more items and that will impact my safety as well so let's let's say okay I was at 35 and I want to go back to 40 so I will have like new items with the X category and when I go back to my base my P base the impact of this so my Su of Safety stock value was 3 19 and the total was 5.1 let's refresh there is no change interesting there is no change [Music] ah yeah there is no change because this is the wrong one I'm using the I'm using the focus accuracy so let's say now I want to move back to 70% of accuracy boom and this one to 60 or 50 so I have more prod with X and Zed and then I if I go back to my base my safety stock value was 5.1 million and it's almost the same it's almost the same because I also move more items in the season but you can see the impact we have more safety on the the ax than before it was something like 300 or something let's go back yes and if I go back to my base yeah was 319 so I'm going to put more safety because I have more products so everything is related at the end what is important what is the total value of Safety stock and what will be the total orders you will have to raise for your suppliers so that's it for the one once again to explain to you how do I play with these numbers the more you will practice the more will get obvious but at the end you have what you have to keep in mind is whatever your percentage you are still reducing your safety stock U by something like between 12 millions and 15 Millions which is a lot and that's going to save you a lot of money and cash flow for your company
in this video we're going to talk about the reorder point so this is the last step we need to calculate the reorder point to know okay how much stock do we have to order if this is urgent and also review uh the current REO point if you have manual REO point in in this specific company so the first step is to calculate so we go back to the base the formula is almost the same than before the the main difference this time is we're using the forecast not the average sales if I go back to the professional level real point we were using the Safety stock plus average sales multiply by seasonality because we are no forecast so I was creating kind of a new forecast average sales times seasonality and then multiply by the lead time and the lead time is the the average lead time plus the review period I divide by two because I feel I don't need the full review period I was explaining that before if you order every week I recommend to as a review period if you have fixed quantity and fixed review period to divide by two it could be like the probability would be like in average 3.5 days you could need the stock one day after the next review or seven days so I divide by two if you if you're not sure about it you can use the full one but this is my recommendation and the safety Le time but this time we don't have safety Le time in the professional because I don't have enough information from my suppliers so in the new one I'm going to keep it very simple we have the recommended Safety stock plus the forecast this time we're going to use the forecast of the N next 13 weeks so 13 weeks is three months divided by 3 * 7 the period because I want to have my it's kind of an average forecast per day multiply by the lead time and keep in mind that my lead time here where's my lead time lead time lead time lead time lead time Le time lead time 118 we already include the review period divided by two review period suppliers we have the review pair delete them and this is the total what we are using okay perfect so I go back to this I have my REO point this is my formula you can check my Excel if I'm going too fast and then the quantity to order it's a long formula why it's a long formula because I wanted to to put all my my information into one one colum but if you want to keep it simple you can divide if you go to the pro you you can divide in different steps you need what do you need okay I need one quantity then you're going to run up to your EQ economic order quantity and then you're going to say ah but my suppliers tell me I need to order minimum 2,500 quantity so this is three steps to have your final order quantity in this specific formula I just put everything into one that's why it looks big and I'm going to use like the this formula called Max um max of EQ and mq because I I need to order the minimum the it will be the maximum of EQ and mq so if my minimum order of my suppliers is lower than my EQ I'm going to order my EQ and if my EQ is higher as well I'm going I'm going to order my EQ to optimize my holding cost so it's a long formula but at the end if my current stocks plus my total F orders plus my total plan orders is more than my reom point then I don't have stock if it's the opposite I'm going to order the difference so we do have the quantity to order and something also you could include I don't have this but you could include this is the back order let's say like you have you don't have any stock you have zero but you already have pending orders from your customers that that could be something that you you could add for example you have 1,000 quantity pending even if you don't have stocks that you will add this quantity to the the need uh to orders so like when we do the difference between the r point and all your stocks total F orders and total plan orders you will include your backorders re point plus backorders to make sure that you you include that in your total need okay so for example in this one you had eight 81 to other you will add one more, quantities make sure you also round up with the loot size and you you respect the minimum order quantity but that's something you could add in addition to the calculation of the reorder points so you have the quantity to order you have the dollar to order in value and then uh you can directly you can can directly calculate how much order do we need to to send to the suppliers we have $1.5 million and then you can do pivot table of this table to the dashboard for example if you want to have a clear picture here we go Supply reports with the dollar two orders and we can see that China it's just a pivot table China is the number one with $216 and you also have the top 50 orders you can do it directly from the base if you want like this largest to smallest if it's too slow you go you go back to manual calculation and this is the most important orders one I can see in this file is you have much more safety stock to reduce than ERS to to send so that's a good news in terms of cash flow this that's why this company uh will focus more inventory optimization and reduction than service but for these specific items especially for all the A and B code this is very important that we place these orders as soon as possible so all this one it's part of the actions yeah we do have a lot of urgent orders it's not necessarily urgent but this is orders we need to well you need an action plan for that just just send the orders to your suppliers but yeah this one is afraid okay etc etc you got me um order so we have all this information or you can directly upload your safety stock and your R point in your Erp and then you will calculate automatically what is the the quantity and all the invoicing parts so if I go back to my 45 steps we did calculate the re point we compare with your current parameters and adjust if you can you could upload your REO Point directly in your Erp system you check the Urgent orders after re reviewing the parameters if you have more information in the professional level I was also explaining how to calculate what is the other stock risk per item and I feel this is something very useful that you could also Implement if your stock is less um well I'm going to I'm not going to go back to this one because you you can check in the professional level but just check how to classify urgent orders that's something also very useful and you can also cancel if you review your parameters and you feel like you need much less than before that's something I was talking before you should also cancel the orders that you don't need so if I go back to my file base we now have new Safety stock calculation and if you feel that you don't need this talk anymore so we can go back to the the inventory turnover and once again if it's more than 200 or let's say 300 days and if you do have orders I was explaining that at the beginning you most likely don't need any orders for most of these products you see I don't have any orders pending I mean I don't need to place any orders so because of that you should probably try to cancel this products right and this is what we've done before and you could you should do it per oop sorry I'm moving really fast now I know quantity to order yeah all of this basically this is new we do have new products as well so be careful with new products I will I will talk about new products after but this one I will definitely try to cancel my orders especially this one okay canel po they're already part of the the list okay okay so we've done all these steps and these steps are extremely profitable trust me this is the most all of them are shortterm because you can canel orders immediately you can also make sure that you don't have any it 10 blocks make sure that all your produ is more than like 200 300 days of inventory they don't have any pending orders coming make sure you don't have any anything block cancel all these late orders that you don't need reset all this reset all these manual parameter this is very very efficient uh because most of the company they do have manual parameters that they they never check and then at the end I have a dynamic Safety stock formula even if this is not perfect even if you don't have the right AB 6y Z like distribution or service Target at the end you will make a big difference just by checking all these steps and even like few of them and make sure that everything is much more automatic than before so trust me apply this and you will at least reduce your inventory by 10% very very quickly
in this new module we're going to talk about demand forecast snop as well and I guess few of you maybe jump directly into this modu because you want to know more about demand forecasting but I really recommend you to build first the file and check all the previous method this is this is a very profitable way to optimize inventory but this is not the most profitable and you I really recommend you to check especially the module just before because forecasting is cool but you can really optimize inventory without any forecast but now let's talk about it we're going to talk about short-term forecast review long-term forecast how to manage new products and that's a big challenge so I'm going to spend quite a lot of time on new products or to stabilize the demand and also how to reduce the number of items so the first one shortterm forecast review we do have the file already and I'm going to keep it very very very simple and the idea is really to focus for the demand on your A and B codes and the first one is check your week minus for S versus week plus four and to to see if you have any change so let's go back to the base we do for that you do need forecast right so we keep in mind that we have this previous sales here and we have the forecast quantity here the forecast quantity are coming from this file forast and I just did the forecast pivot to get my next week's forecast so when we talk about short-term review we want to see okay what's happening the next few weeks so if I go back to my base I want to F filter only on my A and B Cod so what I can do as well I can drill down this largest smallest sales and forecast great I can only keep my and B you could only focus first on a then B but let's check these two and what I want to see so I create a new column called VAR variation forast four weeks versus last four weeks and this is a very simple formula that is very efficient you just you just want to see okay what is the variation of my next four weeks versus my last four weeks okay so for example this the first one I do have I I did sell two 2,300 quantity and my forus for the next four weeks is 1,700 so I'm focusing minus 24% okay so you say Okay minus 24% maybe I should check the seasonality of this uh maybe there is a reason for that what is the this is Brand number two and if I go to Brand number two week 41 Brand number two we we we see some decline uh during this period so maybe that's one of the reason but not really yeah we we may have like 15% or let's check this coefficient of variation of Brand number two in week 41 so explain the all of this coefficient of variation in the professional level if you don't get it I'm going to get back to this but not much so keep in mind and if I go to week 41 I do have 81% and then I'm going to yes so we have we have a decline so that's why that's maybe one of the reason for that but we have more variation than 21% 24% so I would not I will have an if it's we have more variation than 40 but you could start at 50% variation for example and let's say Okay I want to see only the one greater than 0.5 so this one we do have more than 50% variation between this column last four weeks and the next four weeks this is a very basic check but for example if I check this one but that's a discontinued stock so the question is do do you really want to forecast the discontin stock if you are keep selling them I recommend to do it uh to improve your inventory turnover but if you want to only focus on the active one let's only focus on the active one first okay so let's check for example this one so this one we sold 11 quantities and we plan to sell 792 what's going on what is the what is the problem what is the big deal there is a problem with this one right so this alert variation Forex will really help you to highlight the one you need to check first if you have less like if I remove this filter if you have less than for example this one you have 1% variation between this one and this one even if you have seasonality this it will not be my main priority to be honest so we will only focus on this main variation first negative and positive so I did plus we can also did less than zero. five oop no number fter let than minus 0.5 I know we have the one that we are we have really really low forecast this one is 169 and we're going to 73 so I will probably increase this forecast first so my action will be obviously we're going to see in the next video uh reduce no increase forecast okay then you can say to demon planning team if you are not focusing by yourself you could also be no I want to do 0.4 okay so maybe we should check this one as well t t t increase focus and we can do the other one for this ones greater than 0.5 and as you can see we have much more products that we have to reduce of and we are only talking about A and B cods you always start with a then you go to B and then if you have time you start with the biggest volume Seekers right and as you can see we we had to increase maybe 10 it we have to reduce Just In A and B code we have to reduce probably 116 so that's why as well when we seen this dashboard before we were talking in the in the in the when we're building the reporting okay we have too much fast in the system this is one of the reason first of all we have products with with that we need to remove the forecast because they don't we don't need forecast anymore they are discontinued and the second is our forast are way to high okay so our forast are way to high or safety St are way too high and they are manual and uh we we have way too much order in the system that's why the this company has a cash flow problem so I go back to my base and all of these products even if there is a minus 30% but you see when you have 155 between this and this even when you check one week you can see that we are focusing like double much more for example we we sld 21 we're selling we focus to to sell 98 quantities just for next week you can also make sure that because sometimes in the past you don't have good avability so you could say okay I will only want to check the one with 100% avability because the one with no avability maybe it's normal if there is a strong variation but at the end you still have a lot to reduce okay so all of them when I was a demand like a demand planning manager I was just checking this very simple kPa because if it's wrong for the next four weeks it's probably wrong for the next 8 12 and 6 months okay so you could do the same check for 13 weeks 26 weeks as well if you feel um that you want to check more but for example between this one and this one it's much more this one as well so we see the same correlation between one week and 13 weeks maybe not this one where very close to this one 168 okay so you can do another check for 13 weeks you can create the same colum and then we are going to reduce the forecast so my action is to reduce it so it's interesting sometimes say oh I need to order the the stock maybe because we're out of stock as well but also review the forecast first and then check if you need to create new orders so I'm not going to do all of them because we have a lot action plan okay so I'm going to do it so I'm controlling t t t and this is only a and b c sh and this time we do reduce forast boom great so now we have this we go back to the for for so we're going to check the plus and minus for A and B review forecast variation we've done that as well do the same work for week minus 13 and plus 13 so I explain to you how to do it you can do the same column or you can change this formula and say okay now I'm going to do the same for this and this okay boom and it will change automatically not a big deal T analyze your forast accuracy for the last week as well what you can do so this is my the first classic way what you can do as well is to check the forecast accuracy because we do have forecast accuracy so I I feel this is something important as well here we go we do have the forast accuracy yet to date for for example and I would say no I want to focus only on my A and B Cod for my focus accuracy less than oops it's a text filter why is it a text filter doesn't make sense H okay interesting number just multiply by one to have this into number I don't know why but that's weird and then number filter less than let's say 0 0.4 which is really bad and all of these codes I'm going to focus on A and B only you also have a lot with aot big variation okay so you can also use this one this is my year to date if you have the last week forus that something interesting as well you can add if you have it but you you see most of them already have to review the forecast so you can use the forecast accuracy if you have this kpi you can also use my four weeks variation just to help you just be careful if you have any seasonality effect or you have the Christmas your sales are going down so it's normal to have this kind of variation or you can also include the coefficient of season variation if you want to have more more impact in your more accurate visibility in these uh parameters but but I really like to keep it simple and this one is very effent you can also focus on more than 100% variation at the beginning if you feel like your forast is very very is very poor like in terms of forecast accuracy and quality of forecast Okay so we've done that before perfect don't forget after reviewing all your forecast to check if you have new orders so you just need to update your forecast then you refresh this file you go to data query connection you will refresh the forecast here you're going to click on refresh or you're going to copy and paste if you do it manually and then you have to double check again if you don't have any new orders reorder Point quantity to order uh because of that or orders that you could cancel plan orders or F orders because you have way too much stock so it's always a process of first you need to identify which one are the most important then you need to readjust the forecast then you need to review the orders or consel the orders so that's why it's it's not only about moving the forecast because you won't change anything if you don't act to reduce or like rate your orders or review everything okay so that was the short-term forecast review it's very like don't to us straight to the point and in the next one we're going to talk about long-term forecast
now we're going to talk about long-term forecast reviews so this is a bonus module because I feel this is important for you I plan to create a full course how to become a forecasting expert but I feel like this is important that I share how to improve your forecast in this specific method because this is also important if you want to improve your inventory so I'm going to start first by how to define the when and how many this is really the fundamentals that you need to understand when you forecast it's not only one number it's two for me it two main parameters is when and how many so let's go back to the forecast tool so this is a new that's a new version of my uh of My Method so this is brand new you can enjoy it first of all I'm going to keep it very simple with this specific example for you what is important to understand first of all I want just want to make sure that you really understand what is what is about seasonality the seasonality is really important when we talk about forecasting so keep in mind that I'm talking about SE Al it in the the foundation level it's important first of all when we talk about seasonality to identify what kind of which which group of products have the same behavior and the quality of your group and to make sure that they have the same behavior inside is critical if you want to have a good forecast and a good forecast accuracy okay so I was talking about this it's important that you have a good so it could be by brand it could be by Department by category but you don't want to mix for example products that you sell sell a lot In Summer with products that you sell a lot in Winter and if you have more than 10 20% variation per per week or per month I I do feel that this is important to use the seasonality uh to improve your focus or just to improve your mini Maxi or re the point to make sure that you will anticipate for example the Brand number five you can see that the lowest week is close to 50% of an average week and the biggest biggest week is like in week 19 or 20 is close to 180 so this is the variation this is not in value this is in percentage and I explained in the foundation level please check cality to create this so I did the same work for my seasonality with Bron one 2 3 4 five then I smooth my cells to make sure that it's like not it's smooth basically and then I convert into a Bas Android to make sure that I can oh there is a problem here let me check that there is a problem here I'm going to check this formula right now it's good you see I'm not perfect not a big deal it's just one like almost the same and then you saw I divided the smooth cells by the average per week to have what is what is my um average week versus 100% so 100% means this is the average week of my uh of my brand like for example when you're close to this and you can see from if I was only using the seasonality from the ground total I will be most of the time very close to the average except uh at the end of the year but because we split by brand we can see that brand number five is much more volatile doesn't have the same behavior when most of the brands have a peck for Christmas except Brand number three and you could also go even smaller but I do not recommend to have two small groups because the smaller the group The more volatile will be your your seasonality your your base 100 and if you have for example one group with three products and one of these three products is out of stock there will be a mess that would be something like so you don't want to have this you want to have the group as big as possible but as homogeneous with the same behavior as possible okay so that the seasonality will give you the when when it's happening and then you need to have okay what is my Trend or what is the the rhythm of my vent on how much products do I'm selling every week every month and then we're going to combine these two and that's what we're going to do in the forecast tool on the right so I'm using one seasonality for just to give you one example this is my seasonality for one year and that will give me the when so this is my when so in average like I'm close to 100 but at the end of the year the product related to this group will set like 40% more than my average week okay so you really need to understand that I was talking about this in the seasonality module okay so this is my seasonality and now what do we need from the seasonality okay but how how many quantities I'm going to sell so this is my when and my how many is B what we I like to use what we call the average weekly or monthly free work per month if you work per month for the demand for the average you should also use um monthly seasonality okay so how to define a weekly demand it's pretty simple you're going to use so it's better to use demand than sales if you have access to the demon is better than the sales because if you have all of stock shortages you won't see you could have a difference between these two but let's say for example this three show this one has an average weekly demand of 1,000 quantity so you could say okay the last 52 weeks I was selling X I was in this specific I was sing 52,000 units so if I divide by 52 I have 1,000 quantity per week I just add this specific information because I feel this is really important let's say that you are selling this shirt to 50 stores or let's say that you have 50 factories or 50 distribution center it's very important that you also consider what how many sites are selling or consuming your products okay because if this is a critical information let's say for example I was selling um with theatl I was selling selling a bikes or tennis ball and if this tennis ball is sold by 50 store or 2,000 it's a completely different number and most of the time you need to separate these two because the decision of how many stores or clients will take my products will have a massive impact same for when I was selling Cosmetics or lipsticks um when I was in Australia I had two like at four main customers who are buying my products two two Supermarket uh groups and two group of and it was basically um like 80 80 90% of my sales and I could say okay the rhythm of my products is okay I'm going to sell for example 100 products per week per store but I had to know okay how many store will be involved in this uh in this distribution right so that's why I like to split this two what is your weekly demand per site for the average site could be a store Supermarket or distributor and how many sites how many customers are selling or buying your produ okay and this is specific as we do have an average per store of 1,000 we have 50,000 size selling this so at the end my total average G per week is 50,000 with all this information included for this one we have the same number of sites we are selling 100 per week so it will be 5,000 and for this one it's only 10 we only have 20 sites because this is not um this not everyone wants to sell this one so we have 200 per a week you understand that so at the end we we have the OM many and the how many is this one per week but it's related to what is my average sales per site and how many sites do we have in my specific example we're going to keep it simple but I just wanted to include this information because few of you have more than one distributor or one clients buying your products and this information is critical okay then we have the OM many we have the the one and we just have to multiply that's it we consider that these three products are part of the same group of products the same seasonality same behavior so they're going to sell more at the end of the year and at the beginning well maybe not for this case I think for this specific shot it will be like a pick for for for summer but I just wanted to give you one example if you don't have any uh seasonality so you can use your past sales you can also use for example Google Trends I'm going to get back to this after but that's a really cool tool to see okay what is the so you don't have the quantity but you have the seasonality and when I type for example camping tent this is the volume this is the the volume of research and it's kind of a base 100 it's not a base 100 because my base 100 this time is 50 it's not 100 but you can see what that you have a strong Peck uh before summer in May and June and then we're declining so you could use this kind of data as well as a seasonality or you could use your P sales or you could buy this information from market research Etc ET Etc all right so I'm going back to this uh this tool is Free by the way you can use it if you work in retail or if it's a consumer product if you're selling like a nuclear reactor you you won't have much for example let's say like ice cream ice cream yeah you see you have a strong peek or you can we can also predict the C case you see anyway so that that was another story so now we have the focus what we're going to do we're going to multiply my total average Demand by my seasonality and for each week you see I'm multiplying my Demand by my seasonality you can fro to make sure you only keep the first row when you copy and and paste like this and make sure you always keep this color on the right when you go like this so at the end we have three forecast and these three forecasts if we check their value they are very different why they have the same behavior so they have the same curve but they have the the volume per week is completely different so when we insert the graph we have this three forecast obviously this this one looks flat but it's not if I remove this one I will see that you knew the number two is like this and the number three as well exactly the same shape okay the the only main different would be like oh no I have a specific promotion but most of the time even the promotion they we can only apply them for group of product or if you if it's an absolute stock that we want to clean but that was a quick introduction it's very important that you understand that the the forecast is not only one number it's about the when and how many and you combine these two and you have a forecast and in the next episode we're going to use this tool to review your forecast
Okay so we've done this quick introduction I hope this is clear for you now we're going to apply the same principle at a large scale with this forecast generator tool wow so what we're going to do what I built for you is this tool with the week number so you can check my formulas I don't want to spend like 30 minutes to explain how I I made this file it's quite simple uh to be honest you just need to find a trick to get this information automatically I have the weak number I do have my sales so in this specific file I'm using the sales but it's much better if you can have access to the demand information to be honest I do have access but it was more the the file will be more complex and will be more data so I really recommend you if you want to play with this file to switch from sales to demand but I connected this this file to my sales pivot here okay so if you want and if you have the information for example if you calculate the field rate and you have the Dem and the sales always use the demon never the sales if you have a lot of shortages and um it will be much more accurate when we talk about Focus it's always demand okay great you could also I won't have time to explain this right now but you could also say oh if I have like for example I'm selling 100 by at 10% shortages or 90% fear rate you could also increase artificially your sales to like transform your sales into demon but this is this is a bit more complex and let's keep it simple for this one okay so in this file what do I have I get automatically so when I copy and paste one code here so for example this is this is the code I'm going to keep this one after sorry when I copy one code here okay I'm going to remove this let's say for example let's take one like this very stable and that's the one let's take this one I go back to my forecasting tool you copy and paste value because you don't want to lose the format boom wow we have something automatic so what do we see in this graph we can see my sales of 2020 this my say the 2021 and we can see what is my current forecast for 2021 the green one the 2022 is after and what is my forecast new my recommendation so in this specific one we are very very close as you can see I don't see many variation between my current forecast for example between this one and my new forecast we are very close and this is the variation okay maybe we have some variation but then it's not huge variation let's take another example for example uh this one for casting to in this specific case this is my forecast I have for 2021 you can see by my new forecast is much lower based on the previous seasonality okay and in this case you can see that we the recommendation is to reduce my forecast by something like 40 or 50% and we have the same Trend when we see that here you say oh my variation for the next four weeks is plus 54% that's why my focusing tool say no no no no no you should reduce your focus and Aras in your focus for 2021 you should from this point here you should replace to this forast instead of this one okay so we're going to that's the idea of this tool is you're going to focus first on okay on your wor Focus accuracy you're going to see also what are your worst variation and you're going to use this tool to visualize okay does it make sense do do I have to change my forecast yes or no sometimes you don't have to change it but it's good to have this graph for my A and B Cs I always as to my demon planning team to really uh check the graph because it's much easier for the brain to analyze when you see the graph and the data by just checking like numbers in the tab so you're going to use the tab to see okay this is my main variation and then for example this one you say there is a problem is this one yeah so basically we don't have much data Maybe This is a new product and the new for forast will be okay let's keep it very simple and then new forecast will be one one one1 one in this specific case and that is thison stock okay so let's go back to for example this code forecasting tool perfect and what are we going to do so the first thing you need to get your your sales all demand for that I did an what we call H lookup why H lookup is like a V lookup but on on the other side and I'm getting my week number and my sales number if you really want to apply exactly the same I recommend you to check just my formula I'm just doing a concatenation to have the period this is I'm getting the period between my week and my sales then I go to this tab and I get automatically I do an H looker because I'm going this way and my goal is to get okay the right information based on this periods so my H look up is from this this row and I'm going to get okay autom atically what is my value if you have the demand you can switch this sub to demand and you will have the demand automatically that could be a cool exercise for you we do the same for 2021 and then I did the same for my forecast you can see that I don't have forecast in the past which is normal I'm okay with that and I I prefer to keep this uh error because I don't want to see my curve going to zero like I did for my sales and inventory projection so if I go back to my forecast pivot I do the same formula and this time I get my forecast okay so we have this forecast tool for sales forecast and then what do we need we need to have the seasonality the when what is my one my one is my seasonality and my seasonality is based on my brand so you have my item code here then I just do a video cup of okay what is the name of my itm code and what is my I'm going to remove this and what is the brand and the brand is just a v c of my item code to my brand so okay this is Brand number one and Brand number one we've done this work before in the foundation level I did the same work and I create my seasonality per brand here great and my brand number one this is my season for the for 52 weeks my V lookup is here because I need to have a link table I did the same in my Foundation level so I get automatically my B Andro seasonality great so if I go for example just to show you if I go to another product with brand number Brand number two I go to forast Tool it will this will change automatically My Brand number two and also my seasonality will be different okay you get me great amazing what yeah I like this one so everything is automatic I have my B and then I need to have okay this is my current forecast for 2021 22 I don't have I only have 52 52 weeks forecast and then what will be my new forecast and my new forecast will be exactly what we did here but this time we don't have the number of sites we keep it very simple we're going to use what we call the average demand or average sales if you if you don't have the demand and the average sales is here so you have the four weeks up we have the four we cell the 13 the 26 and the 52 Week okay so I'm getting this information from this tab keep in mind I'm always using the same one so it's just a video C to have this information and then we have to decide okay but which one is more relevant for my forecast do I need to use my four weeks my 13 last 13 weeks my 26 weeks my 52 weeks uh in um in this file right so that's a call that you have to make in this specific case you can see that this average sale because then I'm going to divide by the number of week so four 13 26 and 50 and you can see that my average sales per week is quite similar so then you have to decide this is your average sales year and you can play you say no you know what I want to I want to keep more into that the the last four weeks Trend so by doing that I will automatically review and reduce your average sales and my new forecast is just the multiplication between my base 100 and my average sales you could also say no you know what I'm going to go to 600 600 and I will generate automatically my new forecast you get me so that's it I'm using my average sales I'm using my um seasonality for my brand and then I have this tool that will give me okay what will be the new forecast based on my seasonality on my average Sal so I I do recommend to do this work um only for the main variation in terms of Focus accuracy and your variation for the four weeks for example for this one so if you go back to this let's check for example my only my a code and let's check my 0.8 active for example this one maybe there may see let let's check one randomly okay what's happening for this Cod boom H so that's an interesting one you had you had huge Peck in this specific case I will definitely not use my four weeks last four weeks I will use my whoops I is probably my 26 weeks enter boom why because I have up and downs and if I only take my last four weeks I have a very low average sale so I do feel like that that will be the most relevant forecast for this one and you see that is exactly in the middle of this up and down and that's really probably the the forus I'm going to keep because I feel like my new forus 2021 is pretty high compared to the the previous sale so you can see like in terms of graphic it's much easier to understand that just by checking the this numbers and I will just then say okay this is Manu forecast if you have a system you just copy and paste or you you can adjust if you want you can say no you know I I want to play safe I'm going to go to 75 but at the end I will be much safer than having this super high forecast we almost never reach 150 and I don't I don't believe we're going to under two what is the total 250 quantities unless there is a big promotion so that was a very good example and though you need to play one by one you need to to change all of them you need to focus from the main variation lowest and highest and then you go step by step and you really focus on your A and B code okay so that was a bit fast but I really like this to only need to focus like if if you're demand planning team or if you only focus on you only not focus but focus on the most important item with the main variation and you do that every single week at the end but at the beginning you will check like 80% variation but at the end you will only check maybe few products with 20 or 30% variation and this is once again repetition and consistency is key to improve your focus accuracy and the consequence will be to improve your inventory level your level of service for your customers and your number of emails to explain to avoid to explain why you don't have stock or why you have too much stock so if I go back to to my checklist we Define it the seasonality with the when the how many we compound and review the A and B Cod great then we check it's very important once again each time you review your forecast to make sure that you don't have to create new orders or maybe cancel new orders and also yeah check orders to place urgently after review okay so I hope that was clear uh in the next one we're going to talk about the new products and please feel free to adapt this tool and join this tool if you want to go further I'm also creating soon a new course called inventory no it's not forecasting expert and the the idea would be really to duplicate even more tools and methods to generate forecast automatically but this is a really good start that you could use uh to improve your forecast
in this episode we're going to talk about new products I know this is one of the most challenging part for inventory management this is a bonus again this is a new new episode brand new let me know what you think about it and the idea is really to give you insight and methodology to make it as efficient as possible there is no secret it's not easy even Amazon is struggling for new products uh because you don't know because it's a new product the the IDE is really to minimize the impact and the level of uncertainty and that's what I'm going to explain to you right now let's say that you want to launch these three new products these three shirts I was using this one for my workshop if you if you know them and most of the time the companies are not clear with the planning okay if you want to launch a product in what is the minimum total time not only the supply lead time what is the minimum total time to launch product and for most of the companies that it's not clear and I will say okay for my company was we need to know 10 10 months in advance we need to have the design clear and thee every Everything related to prods um eight months before the SN SN review has to be confirmed 6 months before and then we have we need two months with the suppliers and all the complaints part and then we do have four monthly time so be very very clear with everyone and for me was like I was saying to my marketing team look if you want to launch for next summer if you don't tell me uh this by October that will be too late I cannot commit to anything okay so be very very strong in this planning and share it with everyone the second one is you need to have all your information into one place and I can tell you most of the time we don't have it's it's a mess every marketing team as if you work for a big company every marketing team they don't like tools they don't like Excel they don't like system so they won't they they won they will all have different tools they will send this information by email they will change it only by email but it won't be every Everything won't be very clear into one place so I really reinforced I it was a struggle for me but you you you have to say like okay if you want to have your product it's only one specific location could be an Excel a Google sheet like a system if you have a system but one one file that everyone can access not everyone can change you have to be very careful who is responsible with all the information the codes the photos if you have the photos the what is the bom the bill of materials the prices the quantities etc etc I really insist for this one because this is one of the main reason why we are failing is because we don't plan ahead and we don't have the information into one place this information could be for example this file but in this file we need more information than just okay what is the item con we also need to have like the the pricing the the category also maybe if you have any similar products but that would be a good start maybe to have a specific tab uh for new products or you you put it in in a different file okay and make sure that also the new products are part of your base file to make sure you don't miss them then you have to make sure it very related to the first two to integrate to really invite all the stakeholders in the project and every new product is a project it's like a project it's a project uh we need a project manager for that and most of the time uh the demand planner and the is and the SNP manager is kind of the project manager will facilitate uh the success of project between Marketing sales Supply Finance production Logistics merchandising and purchasing and the idea is really to agree on to One Direction one number one planning and one source of information I'm going to talk more about SN later and maybe one day I'm going to do a specific course how to start an SN that works simply because that's a big challenge I was SNP manager for a very long time and it's a it's a challenge then with talk about okay but what about the the quantities and the and um how much we're going to sell what will be the price and that's why it's always better because we don't have the challenge with new products and that's why it's it's not that easy to forus is because we don't have history so we don't know what happened in the past like all the formulas I was Shar with you we were using the the past history and we need to find what we call similar or referent products and that's why I always when marketing um come to me say hey Ed we have these new products to launch great give me three or four similar products and now always suest to suggest to do something like this like a very simple slide during usn process and I gave this template to marketing and I say okay show me like the pictures because as a demand planner I want to see the products as well I need to understand okay we have this so let's say we were selling this one okay we had these very similar products then I need to know okay what was the weekly average sales per site if you are different if you are selling to multiple stores or Distributors it's very important what I said before is like if you are selling to 500 stores before and now you're selling to 200 be careful with the average sales that's why it's we were always talking when I working I was working in the Cosmetic industry it was always the weekly average sales per site and not globally because it was it R depend on your distribution Network I'm talking about this in the previous episode for the forecast okay so I had the weekly average sales per site then it's also very important to have okay what was the average price after promotion uh you say okay I had a produ with $50 my my price was $50 but we did a minus 30% during two months and we that's why you need to have what what was the average price with the weekly average Sal this is very important then you need to know like how many variants like how many SI if you're working the fashion industry will be like how many size do you have for this specific product because the more you have size and also the more you have colors the more you will delate and you will cannibalize your sales so that's why it's very important to understand that number of colors and size if you work like in um it's not only for fashion industry but it's very important to really understand the cannibalization that the more you have options for a customer the more you will spread uh you will spread your sales let's say that you are selling baguet if you only have one baguette one because that's a price in Europe in France you will buy the baguette but if you have if you have access to five different type of baguet you have the SoDo baguet you have the white baguet you have the brown baguet you have the rice baguette then you won't sell five times more you will lose uh you have a delution of yourself that's why it's very important to understand how many products do you have and as well you need to understand okay I was talking about the the how many and the when you need to understand okay what in terms of behavior what kind of seasonality is it is it the same behavior that all this products in this specific case let's say they all have the same the same behavior let's call it the summer group seasonality but sometimes they don't have the same behavior so you have to be careful that they will have the same trend for your forecast as well so the more you will have information before the more it will be easier for you to forecast this product great I'm moving forward another way to get your information I was showing before uh the seasonality you could also use if you don't have any information you could use for example Google Trends I was using this one in my previous uh in my previous episode you could also search for volume from competitors like in my industry I could pay to have access to the the the sales quantity of my competitors in the pharmacy and Supermarket Network the more you will have information before the more it will be powerful and relevant to improve your Focus accuracy and your purchase so don't be afraid to spend money I was spending a lot of money I was spending something like2 or $300,000 just to have more information to improve my focus but by buying this information I was improving my focus accuracy by a lot and also my inventory levels all right so we have the compet Benchmark I was saying before you need to identify the risk of cannibalization to make sure that if you have cuz marketing was of theend you will say yeah we are we are adding 10 more colors so we're going to say 10 times more but this is not the case like the like the baget before you have to be careful of that it's not a rocket science it's not it's not quite easy uh to know exactly what will be the impact if you had one more color one more variant on your C but the best is to find very similar produ and then you can adjust and um and that's the only way then you can you can also classify in advance your ABC XYZ prod products with clear objectives in terms of service and stock so let's go back to these products short one two and three you could say okay we already know that there are a b and c codes if you already have the forecast that will be done automatically in your file if it's not automatic you you could also Define manual ABC classification and then you could also Define okay what will be the acceptable service and I can tell you that 99% of the company they don't specially in the snop process they don't agree on okay what will be my my service for these products because marketing or sales they always 100% but this is not possible so I really recommend you to say hey guys just to be very clear for shot number one and two they are we're targeting this service but for sure number three because it's very uncert you the uncertainty is very is very high based on the previous product we were selling like let's say that this is the this is the the sales of your of similar products we are only targe getting 80% service are you okay with that and you need to make sure that they're okay with that otherwise it won't be profitable for you and that you will also cover your ass when it will happen because it won't be profitable for you to have 19 99% of service right and then you need to Define okay what is the strategy do we want to because we have more uncertainty do we want to have more safety stock on the more uncertain products but we will have more inventory in over stock because of that or do we want to say okay for example this uh pink flower um shirt because we have a lot of uncertainty we won't have any stock we won't buy any stock in advance it will be only from the suppliers directly and I would do like Amazon with the marketplace Amazon is only buying the most profitable items and the one they have more visibility and the one without any visibility they just ask to the the marketplace so all the companies will take the risk of the inventory for them and that's why they don't have any Safety stock or any stock in the warehouse I mean they have this stock but they're not paying for this so you have to really keep in mind and Define okay for each new product what is the strategy okay it's a permanent saber products I want to have a lot of safety because it's very profitable or this is a very uncertain products and I will I will I will FOC I will classify these products immediately into season and I will have a very very low Safety stock or zero Safety stock all right and so we classify these products something as well I really recommend is to test before the best way to know is to test so what I was doing with the catlon another example with the catlon is for very strategic products what we were doing we were shipping so we had this product at the factory and we were shipping by plane like few thousand products and we were putting these products in very like average store these store will like the the the we're really representing the average sales uh for to the specific category and we're putting these products into the store for four weeks and we were observing the sales and say okay we had an idea thanks to this like a test series we could really estimate what would be the average sales for this specific store and then we could deploy this logic to the full Network thanks to this test are so you can do that for one specific uh region one country you could also start to sell only on the e-commerce if you know the repartition on your e-commerce versus your retail a distribution Network that's a great way but most of the company once again because they're going too fast they don't really take the time to test so that's something I recommend if you can do it as well you could also do fake uh fake sales you could put it on your website and but you don't say that it's out of stock you just said it's out of stock when you click on add to my shopping cart then the next one you have to be careful when you have new products you have a lot of things to check is be very careful with the minimum order quantity let's go back to the shot number one you are selling 1 million quantities I mean that's your target your minimum a quantity from your suppliers is 20,000 quantities so if you divide 1,000 by 20,000 multiply by no sorry you need to divide 20,000 by 1,000 let's do it now 20,000 divided by 1 million multiply by the 3 365 days so we we have seven days of inventory turnover for this specific shot number one so it's okay when I get one mq it's seven days the second one 20,000 represent 24 days of inventory so I will have 24 days of inventory just by because of the minimum of orders the last one we do have 20,000 for this this one and the division is simple if you plan to sell 10,000 and you have a minimum of 20,000 you have two years of inventory and this is also another very good example and many cases like for marketing yeah let's do it this is great but the the supply will say no no no no we need at least two or maybe 20,000 quantities because otherwise it's not profitable for the production and then you go back to the marketing a guys and many companies don't even check that they say hey guys we need based on the demand and most most of the time the forecast is too high if you only trust marketing yourself the forecast is probably too high you have two or three or five days of not days but years of inventory so be very careful this is one of the check point you should always have when you it's not only about having the focus or having the the seasonality also making sure that you don't have already Overstock just because the minimum of production is way too high for this kind of products then another step is be be careful because most of the time when we launch a new products we have a because it's a new product and for example if you sell to retailers for example they are buying a lot at the beginning because they need to to fill their shelf right so you need to have a lot of minimum order qualtity so you'll have a big peak at the beginning but then you will have a big drop because they they bought a lot of stock and they don't need to replenish that much because they already have all their safety sock so be very careful with that after the launch and what you you really have to do is for every new launch after two or three weeks like as quick as possible once you get you get data do a review don't wait for like six because most of the company they're going to launch a product they're going to forget about it and then they're going to go back six months after say oh we have a problem we have like massive over Overstock we need to do something or the opposite you're going to say oh we're out of stock if you don't have anything automatic you say we have a big problem because we're out of stock so don't forget to add in your calendar it should be part of the snop review snop process review you do have you do have these meetings before but also after the launch you should have like a forast review to review that okay my average sales was something like 100 but now after few weeks of sales we we do feel like the the average s is not 100 it's something like 50 uh per week so don't forget this one and also don't forget to review your focus and all the the parameters if you feel like your volume complet is completely different from the big beginning okay so that was a long checklist for new products Inventory management i' I've been doing that for a while what you have to also keep in mind is the shorter is the lead time so let's go back to this the shorter is your ch ch the shorter is your lead time the easier is it to for new products if you have some something like for with your suppliers only one week lead time it will be much easier to adjust that if you have one year lead time so don't overthink the the best way to improve your your product launch is to have short lead time with flexibility if you have flexibility with your supplier now even if you are wrong by 50% for your forecast it's okay because you can buy and get stocks really fast if you have a very long lead time the longer is the lead time is like I was saying before the longer is your Le time the more you need to take time with your department sales marketing Finance on also customers to make sure that you have as many information to improve that but a company like Zara because they have a very very shortly time and a very fast production cycle only four weeks even if they're wrong they can launch a new a new batch of production and they can reust the the demand so keep also this in mind it's not only about forus thing it's about Simplicity and the shter isite time the better is the most the easier will be your life
so after this uh long introduction how to manage new products I know this is this is a challenge but what what are we going to do with this Excel right what are we going to do so obviously there is a big process before to have all these forast into your into your system or your Excel if you are still working with Excel but what we can do with this file is to review okay to review to see okay if everything is okay or not so let's go back to new products in these new products what we can check for example something I like to check is what was my forecast for the next 13 weeks and what is what are the quantity in the system for total FM orders and I like to compare okay do we have anything missing yes or no for example for the first one we do have 2,000 we have 2,300 quantities to to forecast and we only have this quantity in the system so let's see what is the lead time if we have a short lead time yeah the lead time is only 10 days so but maybe we need to order yeah we need to no we don't need to order this one but it's a good check that you can do some when the lead time is too short you can also review um you can also review other products but the good example of the first one you you you already have forecast next week but your next order based on this data set is only coming in the next few months so you are not going to sell anything the next few weeks so or you you do another before that's why we have an action order before maybe we should Advance we should uh um escalate es escalate escalate orders like anticipate orders another one would be for example I think the third one this one so my forecast is to sell 3,000 the next four weeks and 13,000 the next 13 weeks I don't have any orders I don't have any orders so let's remove this one all of these we do have forecast right I don't have any orders I do only have plan orders for a few of them that's a big problem right so if I check my file I do have a Realo Point already thanks to my automatic formula and I I should be I should order already the totally order point because I don't have anything in trans so I should order at least 4,000 qualities to supply my customers and there is already an action for that so for all these products let's remove the one with no forecast you should have orders it's because plan order is not confirmed so we should do something about it and most of the time people are just forgetting you know ah yeah it was supposed to happen but I didn't do it so it's like urgent orders urgent orders for all of these product at least from the r point or you could also get more than the r point because you it's a new product and you want to feel to supply more quantity to your distributor but this is a very safety and simple check that you should do for all your new products great the second one is okay analyze the new products versus the mq minimum a quality inventory turnover let's go back to the base so I'm going to talk about this one for my suppliers as well but I feel this is something important so let's remove this new and let's go back to the mq I was talking about the mq before but this is something you want to be very very careful so the Stockton mq is just we're going to divide the mq by the forast so it's a long formula because if it's not um if it's not an if it's an I I prefer to mix sales and forecast to calculate this inventory to over if it's a discontinued stock I don't have forecast so I'm going to divide only by sales and if it's a new code I'm going to divide only by Four cast for the next 52 weeks and for this code what I can do so you could use next 52 weeks I'm using 52 because few of these products are not selling immediately so I like to have uh the whole picture if you if you know exactly how many weeks you're going to sell you can also divide dynamically by the number of week but in this specific case let's keep it very simple just to give you an alert on on that and you have a specific color for that it's a conditional formatting that you can change I like this one I think this is the one and I just say okay if mine it's red if it's more than this specific value here 200 if it's orange if it's between 100 and 200 and it's green if it's okay all right so let's go back to more than 200 filter greater than 200 and all these products they are new and just because of theq you're going to have 200 1,000 like for example this one we only plan to sell 13 for the next 52 weeks and the mq is 36 right so we have more 36 yeah 13 36 so we have three years of inventory just because of that and I was saying before is it a good call from marketing or from uh these guys who have this product because we already have 1,000 1,000 days of inventory just because of that so maybe the forecast is not good so maybe the first thing will be like okay is it a good forecast maybe we we have some we have some information missing maybe the price is wrong but if the Fus is more or less accurate this is not a good call so you should review all of this and you should canel or review theq so I'm going to do that for this product even before during I will review the this mq review or maybe canel the product if it's not too late you should have this analy way before but in this specific case it looks like it's too late my friends you see Inventory management is all about Logics there is no like no rocket sence again we have a lot of a lot ofq to review I'm going to go back to this in the supper module way too many wow okay you get me wow that's a lot review mq is that's a lot of produ maybe the forast is not big enough but at least this is an action plan for my team great so we have we have this done good job I'm very proud of you then you can also regarding the forecast okay let's compare new products for with current current similar active products so I was talking about this before uh this is this is an information you should get from marketing and sales because they are the expert of what's happening but you should you could also do do it uh this is not as easy as people may think you need to have you need to have Insight in terms of information I don't have the pictures because I'm not allowed to share the picture of this product to be honest but what you can do you can first check from the the brand let's say for example Brand number one you can check similar products based on the the sales for example the forecast L just smallest okay oops I'm recording the same time maybe it's lagging yeah and let's say for example these two are the same brand o no no no sorry no M just the smallest so my friend is getting slow it's okay you can if I if I'm too slow I go to review [Music] formula no formula and I go to manual option and then it's instantly yeah I think it's because of my recording it's okay it's all right it's all right so let's say like these two products are similar item number 74 and this is the new one and let's say they are very similar you could compare their forecast you could also use my tool you could say let's say for example you're launching the this item you say and the marketing say hey guys it's very similar to item 74 and what you can do is because if you check this item and you go to my beautiful Focus tool refresh you don't have anything like you just have the forast but you don't have anything and what you could do simply is you can say okay thank you for letting me know that this is the same product great go back to my forecasting tool so that that is the forecast of my the similar products you can see that my forecast is very very strong but you say you know what I feel like this is too strong and maybe it's because I'm using the the last 26 weeks if I'm moving to the last 13 weeks my forus will be I need to refresh now because I'm I disabl that okay my forus will be more like that I like this one so then I'm going to okay I'm going to use a very similar Focus but maybe I'm going to move to 700 because I have my price for example is a bit lower so I'm going to do this F9 because I'm I mean my formula is manual automatic great and I say oh maybe I go to 750 and that will be my forecast for this new code and then I can just upload this forecast in my Excel or in my Erp so you need to find the similar product then you need to adjust you could copy directly the forecast of your your items or you could have something because I don't like to have this kind of f like this I like to have some like a smooth forecast it's also better for the production and your suppliers and then when you're ready you can just copy and paste all the forecast from the itm or directly the new forecast in uh the system that was a good example all right or if you don't trust this you can go back to let's go back to 13 weeks or you could even say no you know what I'm going to go back to the four weeks one and the 4 we one is very similar to this one you can see I feel like the this company was using only the four weeks last four weeks trend which is uh sometimes good because it's very reactive but sometimes too reactive and I feel like this is this is too much I will definitely go back to definitely this trend not the last four weeks unless you had a lot of all of stock before maybe this is because of shortages we could check this as well so I go back to this compare the forecast great you can also canel a product with more than x days of future of stock uh you need to Define simple rules for that and most of the reason of that is based on this mq before let me check this what you could do as well I didn't do that you could also have the stock turn the future stock ter but you could add the quantity or the value of your pending orders to see okay what what's going to happen based on the forecast you could add here the stock okay I'm doing freestyle with you because I like you okay freestyle please total few mods yeah like this and you can see oh now if we have this we have 1,000 we have more than one, the day of inventory okay I think I need to stop recording the same time sorry for that great so you see when we when we include the value of the total F orders plus the stock and we divide wait did I do mistake no I think this is okay uh we do have some uh quantities that are way too high based on the forecast we have for example this one I don't know why we have 6,000 quantities 7,000 quantities coming when the forecast is only 2,800 so that will be a big red flag as well that you should check um in your in your file to make sure that what is coming is not too much versus the forecast you have then I was saying I was I was saying that before regarding like if you want to improve your forecast for your new products I was using the forecasting tool for this specific tool if you do a test Ser uh before maybe for few specific weeks you send the prods by plane in one or two stores and then you multiply by the number of stores you will have much more information to improve well will be the average sales uh totally so that was one of the check you could do like how to test before your lunch and the last one is to review your initial forecast X weeks after launching your new products as said before most of the companies they launch your products and then they forget about it and oh my goodness we have a big problem and for that I recommend to have this very simple tool I was using before in my previous episode just double check when the product is becoming active and selling you can check first of all the the VAR the variation for the one week and four weeks if you have any big variation it will be part of your process especially For A and B codes you can also check the forus accuracy if you do have the forus accuracy on the right we don't have Focus accuracy right now because they're new and you can also review the 13 weeks variation and also use if you if you okay we have a 50% variation you can use my focus tool to review on the graph because I feel this is much easier on the graph all right so that was a long episode again but I feel this is like it is very powerful it's always like safety check but the safety check are critical because most of the companies they change one part of the of the for example they say okay we're going to change the forecast but they forget to update the the orders or the opposite and this is accumulation of mistakes will have massive impact on your inventory and service
in this episode I'm we're going to talk about this is a long-term so we were talking about shortterm midterm and now we have longterm gain uh regarding how to because the best way to have a better forecast is to stabilize the Demand right if you don't have this crazy insane variation like this uh the best way is to make to force the demand to make it smoother and that your life would be much easier for that and we we live in this new world with where everything is urgent but you have multiple options to make your life easier and you don't have to think too much about how how can I improve my forecast accuracy the first one I recommend is to limit price changes and promotion promotion are great on the in the short term to sell more right when I was in this Cosmetic Company in Australia we had very very strong promotions and it was really efficient on the on the short term but the more we are doing promotions the more we had variation before and after the promotion and the more the customer were waiting for the promotion and we were losing money because we were only selling during the promotion that's why also I don't do much promotion with ABC sulation because I feel this is important to bring a consistent value so I really recommend you to always challenge regarding the promotion I think this is a big problem especially for short-term companies such as the companies on the stock market because they have a lot of pressure every quarter they have to to deliver results and I can tell you my previous company was on the stock market and at one point the board of directors say look if you don't increase the sales by 20% we're going to be fired and that was a very very shortterm decision and we had just to tell you one story I was selling a Hugo Boss fragrance perfume which is like a premium brand and because of the we were iming with proor Gumball he was a it was a big acquisition and we paid too much for the this merch and because of that we had to we had to take a very short-term decision to improve the revenue on the in the shortterm way so we did like something like um with the the border of director ask us yeah you need to do a huge promotion because we need really need to improve our sales and we did like a minus 50% promotion on this premium fragrance and perfume and yes we did like something like plus 85% of sale that was amazing in terms of sale but in terms of forecast accuracy in terms of Supply because we're all of so because of that in terms of everything stress it was a disaster and we took something like one year to stabilize the demon again because everyone was waiting for the promotion so I really recommend you to limit as much as you can the promotion I use promotion to reduce my obsolute stock not to manage my demon right so be very careful with that the second advice I can give you is to extend the product life cycle the long the more permanent I your products the easier is it to forecast because you have more sales history you don't have much variation in your portfolio so I would really recommend to extend if you are selling them or to keep the same product but to improve it with a changing the code number the item code right so this is once again very basic but marketing and sales will always push you to change but sometimes stability is key and many companies they base their success by having a lot of stability in their product catalog and in their supply chain and these two are very related the next one is to be reduce changes in your product catalog it's very similar to the first one especially item codes so it's a complete like I can tell you it's extremely complex and I've been doing that many times in my life if you change your item code many times it's a mess it's a mess why because we base all the forecast for example and the inventory management base on S history and if you change your product every three months because there is a new packaging because there is a new formula it's a complete mess you need to duplicate all this what you have to do there is no choice you need to create another another row just below and I recommend you to to have like a link between these two what you can do this is a a quick advice for you you should like if if you have like new products and old products I recommend you to have a number like this one two 3 4 and make sure sure like you have this extra colum to make sure that when you do that for example you're going to Sol by ABC or by code you're going to lose this uh this ranking to have the new code for I like to have the all code and the new code below so it's easier to manage in terms of stock in inventory so I like to add this extra colum like this because when I do that let's say that these two are together okay these two add together right I'm I'm going to do like this it will be easier to understand okay rank just a trick a trick for you you like trick right one not sure it's going to work one I'm doing freestyle again but I think this is the your favorite part right so let's say like if you have a new product new code and this is the all code new code or the opposite I like to have it all together I like to have this kind of ranking to make sure that they they stick together if you do for example ah no but now I want to see all my stocks right from the biggest stock to the smallest one but then I oh I lost my ranking right oh sorry just one second I'm going to copy and paste value great I this this ranking or this classification will just help you to get it back together so if I do stock like this okay and then you say okay but where where was my old code and new code they're not together anymore and yes you to do that nor is you do like this and boom you go back to your you go back to the previous layo and you can see them together so it's much easier to have the old stock and old code and new code next next each other then you can manage them efficiently to see okay what are the stock of these two what are the forecast oh I need to disable the forecast of the new one because the old one the the new one is coming uh same for the ERS etc etc but to be honest this is really really complex to manage uh new cards so I I was always pushing back with marketing and I was always doing my best to avoid any change in the product catalog especially item codes you know if you you will feel you will feel me when you if if it never happened to you you will feel it when it will happen the next one if you want to stabilize the demand is to get access to your customer forecast I was explaining that before when I was selling to supermarket or pharmacy stores I was pay paying 100,000 of dollars a year just to have access to the the final sales because when you say let's say you sell 10,000 quantity to One customer but is if it's if it's another distributor you don't know exactly what's happening you can can you can bu they can buy 10,000 and sell 1,000 per week or 1,000 per per month and this um average Sal for for the final customer is critical to know is okay it's going to be out of stock in two weeks or it's going to be out of stock in two years and this information will create if you just wait for the your the orders from your suppliers you could have what we call the bull whip effect is you will not too late when you need to order again because you won't share any information and then you will you will inform too late the suppliers and it's going to be worse and worse and worse so I really recommend you at least to have a clear communication with your customer to have as much information as you can and don't be afraid to pay to have access to this information because that will improve your inventory your service and your profit for example you could avoid to do air rate or something like that and the last one is to set up long-term contract with your customers and and suppliers to stabilize the volume and the price the more you you play longterm like for for example EA is playing very long term with their suppliers and then they can stabilize the price for the components and then because they stabilize the price they can stabilize the demand because if you increase we had a lot of inflation recently because of the inflation we are increasing the we we have price variation and because of the price variation it's more difficult to predict the demand so the more long-term you are in terms of volume and price with your customer and with your suppliers in terms of also which products you're going to sell the easier it will be to forecast and to stabilize your demand so this is a a very strategic that's why I call it longterm because it's not easy to get access from um to your suppliers or or customers information but I think this is something very strategical that you could you could focus at least on your A and B codes and also with your main suppliers and customers so I hope this is clear and if you have more information regarding that I'm going to do more much more analysis and recommendation in my new forecasting expert uh program
another way to improve your inventory and also improve your forecast accuracy is to reduce your offer of your number of products so I was giving you this example in one of my YouTube video Apple versus Samsung Apple only have one iPhone maybe with three size and three colors and they are making like 100 billions of Revenue only based on these products when Samsung has I don't know how many smartphone they have but they have so many and I'm sure you you know this example you have many example like this the more is not always the better and most of the companies I I think it's because they're too driven by marketing and by creative people they tend to have too many products and they're not selling more they're just creating more complexity and also more complexity for the suppli for the production for the processes but also with the customers and when you don't know what to choose sometimes you don't choose anything and you go back to Apple for example so that's a very good example yes we do have Amazon we selling a lot of products but even Amazon they are not only selling uh they are not holding and buying all these products they are just keeping the most profitable one profitable one and the rest the it's their suppliers and their what we call their vendors from the market place would take will take all the risk and will sell you directly to the consumers but Amazon won't take this risk so I really like this example and for example Apple I was explaining that Apple only have N9 days of inventory turnover versus Samsung 73 days is not the same company I know Samsung is doing more than smartphone but this is a very good example when you when you can really focus on few products you would have much more Simplicity and much more much much better profit if you able to sell these few products okay so now let's go back to the Excel that's a very important principle and your role as a sulation leader or sop leader or maybe work in finance is or buyer Your Role is really to to challenge each time you have each time you have a new product you should at least canel one or two my my my Pol policy was always when we get a new one I had we had to consel two and I was very strong with that so what we can do now is okay but what can we do inward to identify which one we should canel and the answer is very simple most of the oper you have to canel are CZ if we go back to the pivot base keep in mind that most of your products where are the products number of items most of your products are C and Zed and if I take all my products all no this is my stock turn sorry where are my number of products there we go my number of products we do have 71% of my products are C and dead they have low volumes they have a lot of uncertainty and this is the one that are really killing your profit so we really want to focus on this one so if you go back to my base it's simple you have everything say Okay I want to cancel this one and this one great but you don't want to canel all of them first of all all the discontinued are already cancelled right so let's remove this one cool but we still have something like 800 codes then what will be the next step it will be like okay what about considering the one with low margin right so we go back to the left and I say okay less than 0.1 so 10% we do have 68 products so I will start from this if you don't have profits on your product even if you have a perfect forecast accuracy this is not a this is not a good start you have a new product with 0% margin why are we selling this project this product right so I will start from this CZ then low margin the next one will be okay I will also focus on the the one if you don't want to cancel all of them uh you can remove this select all let's all Focus as well and I was talking about this in the my next in my uh previous episode sorry about the mq like how much inventory just because of one mq from the supplier and we can do the same process okay if I have more than 250 for all these products why do we need this product so because we have even too many we have something like 2 143 that's a lot I say greater than 365 one year this one doesn't make sense to have in your portfolio we're talking about 140 42 items because that way the mq is wait why most of them most of them already have uh mq to review and we also have a lot of new products so that's a very easy tool for you to have to really challenge your um the the number of products and I will definitely start from this one and if you have like for example huge stockt mq and low margin this is the winner the other winners like if you do this less than zero upon 15 like this one are definitely the priority this one I will definitely cancel this product because they're not profitable for the company they have way too much St they don't have profit so I will add as an action maybe on the right even review or you can review the mq or you can just consult them so I'm going to do like this canel product at least I would ask or try to convince my marketing because is going to be very complex for you it will impact your capis your performance your promotion your salary your life all right so this is a good check next one can sell item with unreliable suppliers or long lead or too long lead time I don't have much information on this one but if you have the information if you have to focus on one Supply you say okay you have all this item that you want to cancel if in addition to that the suppliers is really bad is always late I will definitely uh add these products to in the the constellation list okay and you can use this you can explain to your marketing team to say hey guys I don't even know why I'm going to to receive this product so it's better if you move forward to with another supplier that's a good excuse and another one another solution would be like okay this we want to canel this prod but maybe we don't have to consel them maybe we just have to sell them directly to the the customer without storing them so when we get the order from the customer we say okay we do have a lead time of two three four depends on the what is the leite time and we do an express delivery directly to you so that would be the the last step is like you can if you don't if you don't convince your team or your marketing team to say we we have to canel them or maybe your factory if you have like too much St in your factory you say okay these item we are not we don't need we are using them maybe a few times a year we could do an express delivery for them when we need them it's only one or two days express delivery and that will be a very efficient way to still have these products available but only few days delivery without having to pay the cost of the uh the inventory for your company so that's it for my uh recommendation to reduce the number of items I think this is we have a lot of action plan once again to improve your demand stabilize keep it simple and I can really trust me by doing even like 20 or 30% of all these actions you will really improve uh your performance and the profits of your company
in this modu we're going to talk about suppliers and procurement and I just wanted to start with a quick introduction before we go back to the Excel so we do or most of Mo every company in the world we do have suppliers and it's really important to track the performance of the suppliers and to adapt the inventory management based on this performance so as a classic company this is what we're going to see from our supplier we're going to see only the the product price the payment temps and the official the contract lead time this is what is visible but most of the company forget that this is the tip of the iceb but what is below and if you want to become a super sem supply chain manager director uh you need to consider all the Iden cost and you have much more than you think the quality if you it's great to have a cheap product but if you don't have if you 20% of your products has to be returned to the supplier this is not you are losing a lot of money the production delay the destruction cost the transport the over stock the return cost the out of stock cost if your supply is not reliable the the admin cost if you spend too much time to talk to your suppliers you have it maybe problems you don't have the right cards you have the procurement cost you need to travel to make sure that everything is okay the currency or like exchange rate costs the custom the inspection the warranty the stress cost the lack of visibility so you have a lot in in environmental cost the no flexibility impact because you have to fix you have to place all your other one year before and that's why I just wanted to highlight with you that it's not only about the cost it's about the flexibility the time and all these uh parameters that will simplify your life and also not only impact your your what you're going to pay to to when you buy the products but what will be the the end profit at the end okay so when we talk about like procurement or suppliers we do have multiple transaction of course the price is important you need to find a decent price uh to have also a decent price for your own customers the quantity you're going to deliver the quality the lead time the flexibility are you able to order like to increase your volume by 20% can you change your volume can you cancel orders uh the real relability if the your supply is doing exactly what we what was planned with you and also every sing related to payment and terms and as a supply chain leader you have to make sure that all it's not only about price but but you have to make sure that all of these parameters are okay and we you you should Define what we call service level agreement with your supplier so now if we go back to the Excel we're going to keep it very simple once again I've been talking about supplier relability in the professional level so please um feel free to come back if it's not clear this is the pro professional level or to classify your your suppliers in this specific example I don't want to repeat what I'm doing and to be honest I don't have as much data as before uh so I recommend you to really check this um complete exercise to classify your your suppliers okay so I'm going to go back go back to this what you can do is it's just a checklist if you want to go further you can go to my S metrics course maybe you're already part of it and if we go back to this I did a full dashboard for procument and sourcing this one this one there we go so if you want to have a full picture of how to manage the quality of your suppliers I recommend if you already part of it you can go to the proc commmand and sourcing module from SM metrics my other course and you will be able to track the what we call the cyot the delivery in full the delivery on quality the delivery on time uh the other statute the the delays we're going to go back to the delays for in this specific example the cash to cash cycle the sa savings and also all um the compliance regarding like ISO Etc Etc so if you want to know more about it check my SM metric course I'm going I'm going really into details all the metrics you need to to consider to to animate the performance of your suppliers but in this specific example we do the problem in in this example I don't have much orders in the past so if I go back to my film orders I just have the one coming so we did what we did in the previous module we we Define okay what was the delay per order what is the absolute delay and what we can do quickly let's do it now freestyle let's do insert pure table let's just check what is the average delay based on the the data set I have to WR now it's not it's not a big one that's why I recommend to check the professional version so let's check PR supplier let's check my absolute DeLay So my absolute delay just keep in mind this is the diff the delays the difference between the the contract delivery date and the estimated delivery date then we do have the delay make sure your Ed has up to date because this this one are not correct you have the delay and the absolute delay is just when it's negative it becomes positive so it's absolute of delay okay and then we have this and we're going to check the average so that's the average we're going to check then let's check what is the minimum and the maximum delay I cannot really track the average lead time because I don't have enough data in the in the past check my profession I'm repeating myself a lot but I have much more data in the the other one in the other in the professional module there we go and you that's a good start we could do descending to delay and we could also count how many other numbers do we have no here just to to count how many orders do we have count just to see if it's relevant you see like for example this one we have an absolute delay of 38 which is bad but it's only one order so I I will feel like this one is maybe maybe something wrong happened but I will really focus on the one with more orders all right so this is my delay condition from my thing and it's also good to see what was the uh not the average let's take the minimum and the maximum so minimum and maximum okay so in this spefic case you can see okay what was the minimum delay zero and what was the maximum delay for this specific example for example France oh let's go filter down to this I'm going a bit fast but just to so we do have my suppliers the number of orders to see if it's relevant what is my average absolute DeLay So in average supplier Chanel one is 11 days late which is not good my the the the earliest delivery was 30 days before and the latest was 25 days this one is even worse we have 150 the opposite and this one should be the opposite as well and the minimum should be the opposite like this okay so now we did like in two or three minutes I did like okay what is the performance of my suppliers I will definitely focus on this one first because they're pretty late this one especially at more than 115 days delay maybe that's another layer that you have to clean but it's just to give you an idea and then I will I will make sure that maybe if your aage 3 delay is 11 you need to reust the averagely time you also need to contact the suppliers so that's part of my checklist expert there we go so you need to analyze the level of service service quantity quality you can also check the service level the delivery on time and if you want to know more about that please check this professional level so we've done that then adjust the average lead time and safety Le time based on the supply the supplier uncertainty so that's what we done in the professional level with a low medium high and then you can define o in this one what would be the safety lead time that you could use so you could use the manual safety Le time with three levels or you could use directly the standard deviation from your orders if you want to use the Safety stock method number four I do I do not recommend this one if you don't have many many orders otherwise the standard deviation will be a bit too high and too strong for me that's why I recommend the method 3 plus my classification of my suppliers like this and a manual safety lead time that we're going to include in the real point I'm repeating myself but this is I feel this is important to go back to this okay so go back to my step I re adjust average lead time and safety safety lead time based on suppliers and certainty The Next Step will be to request root cause analysis of delays from production component or Transportation so it's really important that you you you track as fast as possible when you have any delay and then you ask for okay what's what's happening to understand as well if it's like one specific event or this is something that is going to happen more often for example for transportation like we had massive delays from China to us and China to Europe if you feel like the new lead time is 10 days 10 days later you should really readjust your um lead time to make sure that you you don't have out of stock because of longer lead time okay the next one would be to maybe negotiate discounts in case of delays for with your suppliers it should be maybe part of your contracts of your SE what we call service level agreement uh this service level agreement if we check on this you're going to Define with your suppliers before okay what kind of service are you do you provide what kind of desired performance level especially in terms of re reliability responsiveness in suppli we're going to focus on price first to make sure we have the right price the right quality the right lead time and also you can Define like a a flexibility to move your volume increase or reduce your volume by x% or also the how fast your suppliers can reply it could be also you could also focus on the quality of the data to make sure you have all the correct information for custom for the products for the bill of materials etc etc so I'm going to give you a link like this but I just want to keep it very simple Focus first on lead time lead time service quality quantity and if your suppliers doesn't respect that you could Define like discounts uh don't try to kill your suppliers because I feel like you need to have a longterm relation with your suppliers if you just try to blame your suppliers each time there is a problem at one point if he has too many volumes or too many customers it will just stop with you and so I I would I would not use the service level agreement to to kill my suppliers but really to find the balance and most of the time we just don't have time so we don't really challenge the suppliers so use it as like a partnership uh as a win-win partnership to also help your suppliers to improve its performance than just to get money free money from this so I I predefine to Define service level agreement then I also def recommend to share your forecast with your suppliers uh we were sharing that before but we do have so the theme orders are the one that are already planned I really recommend to share what we call plan orders to your suppliers even if there is no commitment that will really help the the suppliers to have visibility okay are you increasing your volume by 5% 20% uh maybe he has to recruit people or buy more components and the more you will give long-term visibility the easier it will be for you and for your suppliers to provide a good service level so keep in mind I I can see many companies that just have like a very a lot of tension between the the suppliers and they just expect something but I I do feel you need you always need to give something back if you want to improve this relation and don't forget to call them and to visit them even if nowadays with all the pandemics and all this Zoom call I feel like much less people are traveling but I do feel like having this long-term relationship is very very important so if you don't manage to have this quality of service don't forget that it's always possible most of the time to change your supplier so if necessary if you are like if you don't if you feel like your your level of service is too low you have to challenge maybe once a year and that's a job also of the procurement team to make sure that we review not only the price but the level of service and the level of satisfaction of um the team and the sulation team to make sure that we we are on track and the last one will be as well too so you can change your suppli and you could also canel uh suppliers uh with like products with without any reliable Supply so at one point I I had to do this multiple times if you feel that you only have one suppliers doing the product and this is not reliable you have way too much inventory or the quality is bad or the lead time is moving from 50 days to 200 days at one point it's okay sometimes you just say okay let's just stop selling this product because this is a mess or because we don't have any profit so that's the checklist for the first step in the next one we're going to talk about mq review
in this episode I'm going to review again the mq for from your suppliers so keep in mind that you have the maybe you need one product for for your factory or for your stores but at least you have the lot size minimum so you say no we can only Ship by per box and the box is 10 quantities and then you also have what we call theq minimum of order quantity from your suppliers it could be one pallet it could be one container it could be a minimum of production to just to to have a profitable production and at the end and even if you need 50 if your mq is 80 but you need to order 80 and that could have a massive impact on the the level of inventory in your Warehouse or factory or store so if you could have for example I was talking about that for the new products you have one year you have one year forecast 100 quantities your suppliers is 500 quantities so at the end you have just because of the minimum order quantity you have five years of inventory and many companies They Don't Really challenge they just forget about it because Market marketing say yeah we need this product and byy any cost and at the end the cost could be massive for your company so let's go back to this Excel again I was doing that so I'm going to go quick if I go to back to my base you need to if I go back sorry my checklist was calculate the stock rotation of the inventory turnover of my mq from my suppliers so let's go back to this this mq here we go so we do have the minimum order quantity from your suppliers I was calculating last time the the stock turns so keep in mind that for the formula I have three formulas I'm using if it's an an active product I'm using the mix I'm going to divide the quantity of the MyQ by the sales and the forecast for so last 13 weeks plus the forecast of the next 13 weeks so we're going to multiply by 26 and seven if my product is discontinued I it makes sense to only use sales because I feel like I don't have any forecast anymore for most of the items and if this is a new products I'm going to divide only by the the forast for the next 52 weeks so that just I was saying before you don't you don't need something perfect what is important to see okay which one are more than for example 200 okay and you have a lot of products you have a lot of products and what is interesting is to compare the the mq with the eoq you keep in mind that the EQ will give you what is the I'm going back to EQ here the eoq will give you what is the the optimal quantity the economic quantity to balance between the transaction cost and the holding cost so the best scenario will be to have EQ equal to M oq okay if you really want to optimize everything that will be the perfect qu but sometimes you can't because like I was buying for example a bottle of water and the minimum was something like okay you need to order like 10 Petes because just for the production and for the packaging this is the minimum we can do for you and my EQ was something like one pette uh so you need to balance this cost and what is important is to really have a clear visibility what will be the impact between your mq and your mq and when it's really really high so the first step is to really check the the stock turn the second one is to check what is the variation between mq and EQ for example this one so let's take maybe just the active one because that's the one and the new one for example this one your mq is 2,700 my EQ is only 400 so my variation between mq and EQ is 580 per. which is a lot so for sometimes you have a low variation for example this one you say okay this is a new product uh yeah but also because this is a new maybe you would have the full forecast for the year but we only have 10% of varation with my EQ so maybe this is not the the the main priority I will focus so I will say Okay I want to go greater than I will be your top priority first oops not 300 but 300% Z no will be three and that will be your top top top priority first okay you have a huge variation and what this is on the right you can also see what will be the Overstock mq in dollars so it's the difference between the mq value and the EQ value multipli by the cost price so that will give you okay just on this produ we do have 5.7 millions of dollar Overstock just because of the mq because the mq is too high for um regarding your quantity your forecast and your your sales so I really recommend you to have this number and I will focus first on your the main ones so what you can do if you have this colum you don't even need to C to clean everything you just go to largest to smallest okay great and you start from this ones this is like inval that will be your most the biggest impact for your uh company and I will focus first you you could do it per supplier so what we could do we could do a pivot table to say okay but which suppliers as the more the biggest Overstock mq in dollars right because maybe it's India Sri Lanka Etc ETA so you could focus per product and most of them you need to review the mq so you could do it for example for your top top 10 product this one has a lot of problem t t t just to give you an IDE you see like many many products they have multiple optimization solution which is a great new which is great news because you have so many opportunities to improve your your inventory level okay so I'm going to do review no reduce or review review mq boom Okay so so you could do it one by one I would always suggest to start from the biggest ones and see what is possible you can maybe check with your procurement team to see what is possible or you can work for Supply to say okay which one is the which one is the worst one so for that we're going to create a new pivot from table ranch we're going to go back to we can put it here have too many pivot here [Music] oh yeah sorry don't get me wrong pivot existing War sheets there we go and what we're going to do we're going to do sp supplier and we're going to look for mq over stock in dollars great I'm going to filter down s options descending over stock voila and now I do have my values o no the total is to move t t and if you have to focus like if you're procurement team and you have to focus on a few suppliers I will definitely focus on the this top five with just the total of this top five represents 7.8 millions of Overstock which is a lot it's a lot of inventory just because of mq and then yeah you could check this one this one this one but I feel that this is more powerful to negotiate with one supplier to say okay suppliers India number one is by far the number one you could also use it in percentage like this you do Val value field settings and you go to ground total so this one represent 15 almost 16% of your Overstock because of mq and then you have your list you prepare a meeting with your suppliers okay what is my the name of my suppliers this one India or you can do like this up filter sales value up you have your list of over stock and you can say Okay more than than greater than for example $5,000 boom I know you all your list this is we're talking about 95 products you you see because we have only have one file it's so easy to get the information and then you can send the list to if you have a procument team or buyers you say hey guys this is your priority you we need to review the mq this is the current mq and this is the in the B world this is EO the theq I would like to have get me as close as possible from this value that's it okay so maybe you you will only manage to reduce 10% of them but even 10% will represent more than $200,000 of inventory uh savings uh just by the by this negotiation and I do feel like you can always push or maybe negotiate sometimes it's even better to pay a bit more because if you consider something like 10 or 12% inventory per year like let's go back to my EO calculation we we do have a 12% 12.7% average cost of inventory per year so if you can reduce your mq even if you increase your price by five 5% you will save a lot of inventory and in the total cost approach that will be much more profitable so keep in mind that it's not only about buying the cheapest products it's also having the the the best profit like total profit for your company all right so we do have all of this if I go back back to my steps I want a bit fast but I'm repeating the the same principle for the mq so you need to calculate we can call it the stock turn to keep it simple by minim orders quantity just collecting this file for you then negotiate revise your mq is a rotation more than x days uh review mq or you can also say or over stock over stock value more than x doll that's what I I think I feel like in dollar it's even more efficient reviewed your mq initial orders and replenishment orders because you could also have a different mq between your first order for new products and the replenishments so for example it makes sense sometimes to say okay I'm going to accept a big mq for the first one because this is the first time we produce the product but for the replenishment orders you could say we want to un have 50% of the the the initial size of your mq so don't forget that sometime you you if if it's not possible for the first one you can do it for the replenishment one or you can ask for your suppliers to produce in advance to say okay your mq is 10,000 but I can't I can't afford for 10,000 so you're going to produce this 10,000 by yourself and you're going to store in your factory in China or Mexico and I'm going to buy every 2,000 and that's a CA that you could share maybe the the storage will be cheaper in the where your suppliers is um as this Factory than for example if you have a a warehouse in the US or in Paris okay so don't forget that you could also increase if your mq are to guide the sales price uh the marketing so that's another you could stimulate the the the sales that's another possibility you could also change your supplier once again if you feel like this is not like I like to say like there is you should Define like simple rules to say if my product has more than for example 200 days or 300 days of inventory just because of theq I don't accept so you should Define a maximum level if you don't have I I would def find like Define a maximum inventory to level p rules okay and if you're above this level you just it's a noo and the last one will be to delist or cancel the products if there is no more option once again don't be afraid sometimes you need to you need to lose a few battles to win the war it's not a war but just to give you this example all right so mq is a huge opportunity if I go back to my base and i r remove all of this that was one of the main Capt Cher with this company after 6 months yes it takes sometimes it's not like immediate gain but when you see that you have 15 Millions over store because of mq uh on the total level even if you you can reduce by 10 or 20% we're talking about two three 4 5 millions of inventory savings thanks to that and really um need ask some help from your procurement team if you you do have a procurement team in your uh company
next step if you want to improve your inventory value there is another way if you want to improve your cash flow is to improve your cash toach cycle so what is a cash toach cycle I was talking about it in my SM metric course is uh this so you do have uh the the supplyer payment let's say you have to pay your your suppliers uh in the next 30 days after receiving the products or shipping the produ it depends what are the condition then your your customer they will pay you uh after 60 days okay so at the end you have what we call Cash Flow Gap and you need to finance at one point okay if you your suppliers have 30 days and your customer only pay in 60 days you you need to pay you have 30 days that you need to finance with your bank for example then in addition to that you have the supply lead time let's say like you you pay your your suppliers when he's going to ship your product so you have 20 days then you have the storage the storage is 40 days in average you have like 40 days inventory turn over for your products or your production if you produce something and then maybe you have the distribution of your products plus 10 days if you need to store your prods in a retail company for example and at the end you need to include in above that you need to include the cash flow gap between your suppliers and your customers so the total stock that you need to finance you need to the cash flow you need will be not only the 30 days but it will be 100 days and one of the solution if you want to improve improve your cash flow is to improve your supplier payment right so that's what we're going to talk about right now in the excel in this Excel so you need to focus once again if you really have a cash flow problem on the 2080 suppliers and the customer payment terms the most important would be to focus because we're talking about suppliers on the suppliers but you need to have a clear picture which suppliers are the biggest one if I go back to my f ERS or you can go to your supplier you could check based on S you could check also based on forecast or you could check based on volume of purchase in this specific example I don't have much on a purchase I just have my f orders I'm not sure yeah I do have three models in value so I could add them if I want you could just based that on what is the the current volume of your orders like this okay that will be my top priority China six then Romania then India that's all the volumes you have right now or you could base this calculation on the volume of forecast if I go back to my suppliers so I just did a pivot table of my sales for the last 26 weeks and my forus for the next 52 weeks and I just did the sum of these two and I just divide by the total okay so that will give me a percentage of which one are the most important based on my sales and my forecast of course if you have one year inventory for one suppliers you won't buy that much but that's something um I think that's relevant to mix sales and forecast in this specific example especially if you don't have much forecast and then you can filter by which one are the biggest one and it's fun where when you talk about sales and forecast we don't have the same suppliers number one we have this time Spain three then China six and Romania is not is only the number seven so be very clear which suppliers are are using the most cash for your company and then you need to focus from the top it's like always you focus from the most important one then the second one one then the third one okay great 44 save so custom and payment ter you also it would be great as well to have the payment terms for all of them in this file I'm not I'm not sure of this in my suppliers that would be great to have also the number of days with the payment TS I've done that in mymetric course per suppliers I do have the supplier payable days and it's good to have all these information then you can see that so I recommend to have it the lead time and also the supplyer payable days it's good to remember that then I go back to my file great say you should negotiate the payment terms as as as better as possible and you could also review what we call the inot terms uh the the way you you select your inot terms could also impact the way you pay and when you pay your suppliers I'm not an expert in in cont I'm always working with consulting or experts in this specific field but uh you should also have a look on this if you want to improve the way you pay and who is resp when you you are responsible of the inventory but I will always focus on the the your biggest suppliers first all right
all right we did 23 of the the steps to improve your inventory and I can tell you even if you did like 10% of it you will probably improve your inventory by 5 to 10% already so the next one is total cost of ownership so you can see it's a long-term game because this this is not something you can change immediately but I just wanted to go back to this what are we talking about about what is total cost of ownership so that was the the the introduction I was giving to you just before most of the company only focus on the product price the payment terms and the official lead times and you have much more than that and you it's really important to understand what is the final profit of your products and the final profit for every suppliers and sometimes it's not a good it's not a good move to just take the cheapest suppliers in the world you could be like okay I'm looking for this specific uh cutton should I get it from China Bangladesh India all the US and the real question is okay but what is it's not only about the cost the quality the quantity the when uh the flexibility uh also the if it's a specific product that maybe get get give you more value like if it's made in America you maybe can sell it a bit more expensive etc etc and also what is impact uh on the planet it's really that's a really tricky question because for the last 20 30 40 years we we we tend to really find for the cheapest product on the planet China was the biggest winner regarding this game but now China is getting more expensive more and more expensive we do have uh big Chan regarding the transport reliability the transport are getting much longer than before and now we have this trend that like company has thinking this the Focus right now is not about having the cheapest but it having the the safest and to secure the supply chain because we had so many disruption and issues in the supply CH over the last few years then the Focus right now is just to make sure that we are we can have the products because we had so many out of stock with all the pandemic the wars and the inflation coming all right so the real question as well is it's not only about the location of your where what is the location of your suppliers but it's also about the lead time of your supplier uh if you could get it from boat from plane or from truck and this also will impact dramatically the way you will get your product the flexibility I was talking about Apple before the the decision is to say okay we're going to get all the iPhone from China from foxcom but we're going to ship everything by plane so it will be the same that we have a factory in in the US and shipping by truck not the same in terms of Transport cost of course but that's a different strategy of course it's not that easy to move a factory and I can tell you that many many like production processes are not available for example in Europe it's very difficult for example to produce television and smartphone in Europe because we don't have all the component industry and we don't have the skills anymore so that's a big challenge but that's a long-term Challenge and I plan to do like um like what we call TCO calculator to also help you to take the right decision between the cost of your the purchase cost the cost of inventory the holding cost the flexibility etc etc don't forget as well there is an impact on every decision regarding the transport regarding the where where is your factory and for for example if you decide to to to ship everything by plane it will be a 400 like something like this is the gram per turn it will be 435 tons per per per plane and it will be only three grams if you use a large container vessel so be aware of that I do not feel that we are paying the right price right now for especially for carbon emissions and I I do believe that we're going to pay much more in the future because this is one of the only way if you want to minimize the impact on the planet and I was spending way too much money and um and time doing afraid for example when I was working in the Cosmetic industry because it was too cheap it was too cheap so it was obvious for us when you have small products with high profits you tend to ship everything by plane which is not always very responsible okay so if I go back to my to my file I it's um very general policy but it's something you need to to think about as a strategy for your suppli sh is to review the procument policy on your most important products and suppliers once again we did the leers before you need to prioritize in flexibility and lead time versus PCH purchase price I mean you need to find the balance between these two even if you pay 10% more but you can have maybe a much less lead time keep in mind that one of the main parameters in your in your file in the Safety stock and Realo point is the lead time so if your current let's go back to the the REO point in my REO point I do have the lead time and if I reduce my if I divide my my lead time by two I'm going to divide my rear Point by two okay so for example my re point is 17 177,000 if I lead time now is 44 nor my run point is 9,600 so I divide it by two my inventory by divided by into my lead time and if you pay 12 13 15% of inventory cost every year that could have a massive impact so you could change the location of your supplier or you could uh do like Express transport uh to avoid this extra inventory I recommend you to do your own calculation for that all right so change your suppliers your transport type your country or production your supply I do feel like this is we have a new movement coming and I really want to help you to find uh to have the right tools to get the right decision and also to convince not only your suppliers but also inside your company uh to get back to more Simplicity and maybe more proximity in the supply sham because I do feel this is way too complex to have 200 suppliers in 200 different countries in the world and simplicity will be I think the the biggest challenge for us in the next 10 or 20 years
Next Step we're going to talk about inventory Consignment so what is inventory Consignment is the fact that let's say you have a store and you're going to say to the supplier look I like your new shoes or I like your new Cosmetics it's it's very common in the Cosmetic industry but you know what I don't really know if I'm going to sell it I don't have much cash flow to buy your products so I'm going to take your products and I'm going to pay you once uh I sold my this products to my consumers to my clients and that's what we call inventory Consignment that's a beautiful way if you don't if you really want to improve your inventory level because basically you don't really pay for even if you have like 1,000 quantity you don't really pay for the cost and that's something very powerful if we go back to the cash to cash cycle I was showing that before if you don't have uh to pay your suppliers before and you get even the money of your customer before you pay your suppliers you have a positive cash flow and that's something amazing without even optimizing your level of inventory your safety stock etc etc so you have multiple way to do it you could do it in your like in this example for example you have to go back to it it will be like okay I'm going to save this Gap so I'm going to save uh 70 days of U I'm going to save 30 days of cash flow so you could have this in the retail store it could be like a specific part for example new suppliers for example like if you have new companies going on to to the market because they are not famous yet they're ready to pay for it like in the Cosmetic industry when we we wanted to launch a new products we with Pharmacy or Supermarket we said okay we're going to pay for it and you just pay me a once your your your customer bought your your products so you could be like in the reserve in your in your stores then you could have the same in your distribution centers and the most famous one is Amazon Amazon has a lot of kind of Consignment stock they don't own the stock it's from the third party or what we call the the Amazon FBA distributors they're going to store the products from the from these companies and they're going to use the marketplace to sell it but they will never pay for the inventory and they will just take a cut a percentage for Logistics and uh also for marketing so that's a beautiful way to improve your cash flow and don't pay for inventory and this is the principle of the FBA uh you're going to pick your products you're going to send all the information assign it to the the Amazon Fulfillment centers and then you're going to sell it and you're going to get the money but at the end as if you use FBA you take all the risk you pay for inventory you pay for promotion you pay for storage and Amazon will just take the profit because they have a big Monopoly right now on the E business and that's why they can use their power of selling and distribution to make this you could also have the same with the factory for example this is an example there was an example with Rena or most of the cars Industries uh the suppliers for example valo or Foria they will they will pay for the inventory and they will deliver and they will most of the time they're also responsible for the inventory management directly in the factory to make sure they they have a good service and the the supply the car manufacturer like Rena they will only pay once um the the components is used by the the production to make new car so that's a very like efficient way to do it the thing is you also have to be careful that for Consignment it's a big negot negotiation to to have we've done it as well with the catl with specific suppliers it's not as easy as you think you have a lot of like it and finance um tricks to make this happen because you need to know exactly when you have to pay you need to follow your stock you will have let's say in your let's say you have an Excel like this you say okay this is my inventory value but no you should create maybe another Cod to say okay this stock is for example consigned so I will not consider this stock value for for my analysis so I will use it for inventory management but not for analysis at one point as well if the the supplier is responsible for the inventory we had a lot of tension because he was complaining that we had way too much inventory so you need to Define who is responsible for inventory management and we wanted to have more stock to have more service they wanted to have less inventory because they were paying a lot of inventory so on the paper it's great but the execution of this is not that simple so you I really recommend you to try on the very small parameters with a supplier you really trust you have a great communication in terms of like meetings emails it and once it's working then you can duplicate if you feel like this is very strategic for you another example as well is like if you have a big company um that was okay with the Caton this other suppliers they the warehouse just for us because we we are the biggest customer so if you feel like you have one warehouse for your supplier and the the superer has one warehouse for you at one point you can say okay let's share the cost let's share the cost let's only have one warehouse for both ofs let's divide the cost of storage and let's just split the bill and it's a win-win for everyone so you have a lot of um opportunity regarding how to say to save and merge the cost but keep it very simple and always focus with your biggest suppliers and the biggest value because it's not that easy it could be like more than one or two years projects to to implement that then you also need to Define very clear clear rules okay what are the rules to return the products sometimes the supplyer we can you can keep the products or you can do a promotion I give it to to you like with no profit so you need to be very clear what will be the the roles in terms of inventory management returns or maybe uh give it away if this is too late for example for the food industry be once again very careful with the complexity before implementing try first and don't yeah keep it very simple because like in the it part for us it was it was a big Challenge and at the end we had to stop few collaboration because of that all right so that what that what that's it for the the consignment inventory that's just another idea it's a long-term project but that could be something really cool you could Implement in your company
in this module we're going to talk about logistics and distribution we're going to talk about stock Tech shortage management M multi- Echelon inventory optimization should you open or close your more Warehouse of storage point lead time stabilization and storage capacity reduction okay so we have a lot lot to talk about again the the goal of this is really how to optimize your inventory and services so first of all inventory check or what we call stock Tech I was talking about this one before when we were doing the dashboard I was talking about the inventory accuracy and to create the inventory accuracy please refer to the kpi expert module and for that I did it's it's quite simple you need to send people to your Warehouse your factory your store and they have to scan and they have to count and make sure that your stock what was your stock before what is your stock after do you have any difference so just quickly if I go back to this it's in my base you have the stock you you have the stock quantity and you have the stock take it's very important that you don't have any movement of inventory be before when when you check that if you do that but in the meantime you're still picking a products for your customers it will be completely wrong so it's very important for that you have your stock quantity you have your stock take and then you can compare okay which one are correct or not the inventory accuracy is in could be in value or Gap the inventory accuracy is just if you have the same value before and after you have have one 100% if you have zero if you have the different value you have zero all right so this is a good example for example this one we were supposed to have zero but we found 26,000 piece so maybe someone forgot to be one pallet etc etc and your inventory accuracy total is the average of all your inventory accuracy per product so in this case we have 89% and for the the Gap we're going to do the difference between what was before and after and we're going to multiply by the stock price to have okay what is the value in this case we have Plus $389,000 for this one but at the end the total inventory Gap is something like minus $4.5 million which is a lot and most of the time you have less inventory after than before because people the stock disappear and people like to take stock from home so you have to be very careful with that okay so we do have a peot base from that where is my stock inventory inventory accuracy there we go we do have the inventory accuracy here if you check my formula I've done that before just quickly we have the average here average and we do have the sum of inventory Gap in value and we can see that most of the Gap is coming from Brun number one and then you can also check okay which one are my biggest Gap so if I go back to my base I would check first maybe my smallest one negative too many Excel open great inventory Gap ah yeah that was weird because yeah makes sense now okay I need to close o all right I need to disable my [Music] calculation manual okay and we do have a lot of inventory gape especially for discontinued stock and I will always focus on my main G before to make sure before we update the system that this is correct because we're talking like just for one produ minus 638,000 of inventory gap which is a lot okay so that was just one example in my checklist so I recommend to do check inventory accuracy of item without movement for the last X days so you could also in addition to this like one shot stock T that could cost a lot of money I will recommend to do it in a more frequent way for specific items so for example you could do an inventory check what I was doing so I was designing an algorithm and model to send automatic request to the the warehouse team to say okay if the product didn't move for like if you don't have any movement of inventory for the last for example 10 days and it's a for example it's a top seller product we're going to send someone to make sure we can we we're going to we're going to double check the stock now that's one condition so you could do it from this Excel for example you could say okay if I didn't sell for example for the last four weeks all these products I'm going to use only the active and discontin okay so for example this product yeah we have a lot of thison Let's Take Take on the active ones for example all these products with inventory I will take only the one with inventory stock great so you see we do have products they do have forecast let's do forecast more than zero these product they forecast but they're not selling and they do have stock so I will like in addition to the one big stock T maybe once a year or twice a year I will have frequent uh stock T only on few very specific items to make sure that uh they don't have like we don't wait for one year six months to to correct the stock so I will focus with this one you have stock you didn't sell for the last four weeks and you have forecast quantity okay that's one good check and it's only like few how many we're only talking about 30 at it so I will send this request automatically hey guys can you double check that there is no problem with this product may you could be like the the stock is wrong you could be also like the quality of the product is not good enough so we cannot pick this product Etc Etc okay so that's one state the second one is I I recommend to do Rolling Stock tech for my A and B Cod every uh X weeks so what I recommend is in addition to that I will not wait for one year to do what we call like the stock Tech I'm going to remove this for my A and B Cod because they're very very important so I will do this more often for this very important product okay T especially the one with low stock and avability like close like 0% availability or ABC code that are not ABC not see that are not selling for for a very long time so once again if you don't have much sales I will have like in my system it was automatically every a andb Cod was checked at least every two months and one my the the person who was responsible for the pi picking was getting one stock some sometimes he had the request on his Pad to say okay please in the same time that you pick a product please confirm the quantity that you can see in this specific location all right so I just give you tricks but this is very important that you don't just do the the stock tech for for your CFO you do it as well to make sure that you have the right inventory to replenish the right quantities it's also very important that you do root cause analysis for the main variation to understand okay but what happened I always recommend to do it for the biggest Gap so if I go back to my stock Tech here I would always recommend to say okay we do have a $474,000 gap what happened so you need to get this number and see okay what was the last movement of this product okay coming from these suppliers what happened is it an IT issues is it some someone who basically sto the products is it a pricing issue is it a quality issue but it's very important at least for your top 10 positive and negative so this is a positive and I will do the same for the neg for the positive make sure you do root cause analysis to maybe because usually when I do reest on 10 or 20 products I will find some like a problem that it's not only for this products but it's it's probably applied for maybe two or three or 4 product so it's very important to have this routine detail is is very important but do it always on your top uh Gap so R cause analysis check then what you have to to do if you have like if you find that you have expired stock damage stock obsolute stock you need to destroy or donate them so the same principle than promotion before if you cannot promote this product you need to clean your inventory to make sure you only have the one that you can supply to your customers and the last step also very important it's also very important that you animate and you communicate the if you have like product shelf life and expiration date that you communicate the the list very frequently to your marketing and sales team to make sure that they take actions before it's too late so when I was working in the Cosmetic industry or the food industry every week I was sending okay hey guys this is my list of the products that are going to be expired the next months just be aware that we're going to destroy this products in one month so I had a list in this specific case I don't have the DAT but if you have a you could have a list with all your expir date and all the quantity with so you could have multiple rows for one item because you could have you most of the time you have multiple batch and I was sending this list with the the price the quantity and also the margin hey guys this is uh we're going to destroy this products in one month in three weeks in one week and it was I was always sorting by the one I'm going to destroy this product with like a with a few colors to make sure that it was very clear for everyone that if we don't do anything we're going to lose this amount of money and I was very efficient because we had this report every uh every week that one of my demand planner was sending and because it was part of the routine of the SNP process as well everyone at one point was waiting for this list to do promotions or even donations or promotional activities because if you know that you're going to lose a product you can also give it for free for your customers to like for like get buy one get one for free etc etc so make sure you have a clear process with a clear communication and someone is responsible in your team or at least you give access to this list to your commercial team that to make sure that they they really take care of this all right so before before I finish I also recommend to have visualization of the quality of your inventory this is for example a dashboard from SM metric if you follow my SM metric course I recommend to go to the dashboard warehouse and here you can see the the inventory accuracy uh from your Warehouse per location which is something pretty cool that you can you can deep dive to like for example you could say Okay I want to see only sector one it doesn't work F9 yeah oh you only want you want to see you want you only want to see your a Cod for example or specific categories and that's something I'm going to teach you if you join my course SM metrics but just to give you inspiration this is try to make it as visual as possible okay so that's it for inventory accuracy and stock Tech in the next episode we're going to talk about shortage management
now we're going to talk about shortage management you don't have enough stock for everyone you don't have enough stock for your distribution Network what you going to do so I'm going to do as well a bonus like a crisis uh survival kit at the end of this code which is not mandatory what do you do if your demand is dropping or if you don't have enough stock for everyone but I wanted to keep it very simple for this example and what are we doing for that so the first thing when you have shortage the first thing is to identify okay which products are close to shortage or with like zero stock and most of the time we react to too late and before we before we even react we don't have enough stock and that's that's it we have to wait for one two three four five weeks so the first step is to identify which items have low stock even before zero so we're going to go to the base you know this file now and what we're going to do we're going to go for what you going to do you're going to first classify per volume to see largest sales and forecast okay so we do have lot of Sellers and what what we're going to do next is to check the inventory turn and let's check this one less than 20 days boom so all these prod yes they are green but they're not really green because they're really close to zero or zero zero inventory for all these products so let's remove the new one right all these products we don't have much stock or we are very close to zero even this one like when you see like we have okay we have 2,000 quantities but my forecast is to sell 3,400 for the next four weeks and I'm not sure I have even stock coming yeah I do have stock coming so this one should be fine so what you can do you can do the in stock turn like this you could also do the stock turn for the next 4 weeks and remove the quantity of your inventory return and then all of them so let's maybe reduce this one [Music] to less than 10 right and all of this or you have zero or you have very close to zero okay and you need to have a shortage management strategy for this one so you could remove if you want the discontinued one as well if you want but I feel you also need to manage the the the shortage of this one because you want to make sure you sell these product to the most important customers and they don't spend like six months in one specific store that will never sell it right so now you have a clearly okay this one have a shortage risk all of this and I will definitely start with my a and because we do have products coming so you could say okay I could say like I'm I'm going to check only the one with no stock coming within the next I'm going to remove H this one is interesting yeah I I need need to change of date format I will remove the one coming in October okay so now I don't have any prods coming in October so this one are critical and that will be the list we're talking about 105 itms that you should really manage the shortage or what you could do you could say okay you could even do less than 20 days you could also combine this with the the lead time of your suppliers if you have a very short lead time it's less orent than not so you need to play with this file identify okay which one are more urgent than the others because if you still have inventory there is you can still optimize like all of this for example you still have inventory so you can still optimize the way you're going to sell it and I can tell you if you don't do anything few customers will take all of it and then you're going to lose much more money that if you do it in know in a way that everyone takes just a p a small percentage of it but everyone is going to sell it okay so what you're going to do is first you need to identify these products then you need to be very clear okay what is the perod that risk is it one week two weeks 3 weeks or four weeks you can check when is the next order coming it can be a bit manual but with this file you at least you have a visibility and I will only focus on the most important item if this is like a product that you only sell five or times a week it don't really matter then the next step is for me especially if you work with the retail industry is to prohibit to to like avoid any manual orders only what we call confirm and I will only do like what we do like automatic oh I would do like something like this automatic Matic orders from replenishment so what do I mean by replenishment it's not a human because the the the human behavior tends to order way too much when it's manual because they have this fear of missing they want to be the first the first to have the product because it's too late so I will what I will do I will do it some I will do something automatic if you have if you have this information from your stores to say okay I will only accept automatic order I will not accept the one from the the the your your story if they are manual or if they're not generated by a mini Maxi for example okay so that's something I would be very careful that could be a very simple rules if for example in my in my company before it was like okay if you have less than two weeks inventory in the warehouse It's forbidden to do any manual orders we only trust the system to supply automatically so that's something you could do something else you could do is to say okay when I don't have enough stock I will only only send my stock to my biggest customers so that's something it's not easy to explain especially for a small one but I can tell you each time you have shortage the biggest customer will will sell much faster and will be out of s much faster than your small customers because most of the time like the inventory turnover the big stores or the big customers tend to be much lower than the the one who was just selling few times a year so be very carefully that that's a very very uh important subject that you need to also have a clear communication but if you start to prioritize your biggest customer maybe you can give an alternative or maybe discount for your small one but at the end your goal is to sell more right so if you want to sell more you really need to focus on these ones then what you can do as well so we're going to talk about multi if you have multiple sites below but you need also to standardize and communicate the shortage management process if you don't have clear communication it will be very uh frustrated for all your customers so what I was doing in my previous company we had a very simple I was saying you we had okay if we have less than 20 days inventory noral noal manual orders uh we're going to we're going to prioritize first of all this type of customers or maybe the customer that they pay in advance or the one who we are sure we're going to sell and then we were we're communicating these rules to all the commercial team to make sure that there were no fight between all of these these rules were approved by the CEO because it's very important to involve everyone in the company because at the end if you do this properly I can I'm going to give you one story one of my suppliers was doing a it was not from me it was from this this company called called Deaton so they were doing like skateboards and the the factory burned so for three we knew in advance that for three months we would have no skateboard for this from these specific suppliers and it was the biggest suppliers in the world so what we did is we're starting to really focus on our main Distributors and stores in the world like it was the 20180 it was very clear which one will sell it and we allocate most of the stock to this only it to this to and for the other one uh what we did is we Supply different models from different brands but at the end even if we had like three months like we were supposed to have three month shortage we managed to increase our sales because the distribution of this inventory was much more efficient than before so you really need to plan that and I'm going to do a very specific bonus to tell you what to do step by step at the end of this course but this is not mandatory
in this video we're going to talk about multi aelon inventory optimization what is echelon basically is you have different level of storage location in your network and I'm going to go straight to the point for this one with the short-term gain and then I'm going to talk about how to reduce or why you should not open new storage location if you want to optimize your inventory so first of all let's check in this specific file I don't know if you remember but we do have most of the time we were checking the inventory of the warehouse but we do also have distribution to 39 sites okay and that's what we're going to use and when I go back to my checklist they say okay check the percentage of inventory between your sites what we going to do we're going to go to the base and now we're going to use what we I I didn't use this one before okay what is the stock total I have my Warehouse stock here I have my total stock and I have my side stocks okay and what is interesting okay what is my total stock and what is the percentage of my stock which is in my warehouse and which one which percentage of my stock is to my distribution site and it's interesting to see like at the total level we do have let me remove this clear at the total level we do have I should do that I'm going to do that t divided by this so we do have 26% of the inventory in the in the side distribution and I guess 30 73% at the wse I'm getting I'm getting slower at the end of the day and what is interesting you say okay I can tell you that when you have too much inv in your distribution Network it's a problem and you may have out of stock issues so we we can just say okay for example if you have 100% of your inventory in your site you won't have any availability in your warehouse and you won't have you probably have way too much stocks uh in specific location for example let's check this item and let's go to Total stock no this one that's the first one yeah this one you can see that we have zero at the warehouse but we do have 5,000 quantities and the problem is you have for example this one has 1771 this one 184 but side number 10 has zero and we cannot get any more from the warehouse because we don't have enough and probably that this this side number one 2 3 4 they have way too much or this one for example and because of this we don't have enough for site number 10 and maybe another one yeah side number 10 oops and because of this one we're all of talking one side probably a few will come as well because for example 16 is very low etc etc so you need to have a clear visibility and what you can do one of the KP I was using is I go back to my base is the percentage of stock in my distribution Network versus my warehouse and I just did like a condition formatting if it's more than 75% that's a good let's start from this greater than 0.75 and that will give you like a good alert okay which products are have too much talk in the in the distribution Network and not enough in the warehouse and most of them you can see that we or we don't have or we have a very low quantity compared for example even this one we don't have much in the west and we have a lot in the distribution Network so I will focus first on this one if I go back to my checklist first you need to check the percentage of inventory between your sites great then you can check the inventory turnover by side because at the end you could have for example if I go back to this one you say okay this one probably have okay has 192 192 day quantities but is it like one day of inventory to over or is it like one year so it's important like if you really want to optimize it would be good to also see the the inventory inventory turnover per site whatever it's a factory it's a warehouse or it's a retail store okay so for that we have multiple option you can recalculate based on the sales of every single site you divide the stock by the for example the the sales of the last four weeks for example this is from my SM Matrix course you have this kind of dashboard where you can see what is the stock turn for your different sto storage location in the in the States of America you can see the stock turn here or you can have a table or you could do a map and the higher is the bigger for example Arizona has 53 days when this when Oregon has only 43 so that mean that Oregon is more efficient in the way that using the stock they have more sales and less inventory that's why they have a better inventory turnover you could use this map really to animate your different regions and sites manager this is another example from my Excel course SM Excel course um if you if you have access to this course you can enjoy this one and in this one you can see we have multiple storage location in Europe and you can see that for example France is 48 days when Greece is 120 so we probably need to readjust the way we we manage inventory in Europe and that's a good way in a very visual way to see what is the situation you could also check per brand to see okay it's even worse if I only check Brand number one this location is much higher or is much higher than France or Belgium good good job in Belgium but you can also check check the the avability in the same time so you can see that Belgium they have the lowest inventory return over in Europe but they also have the lowest avability so that's a big problem that's why we probably need to regu and this kind of map will really help you uh to uh to really um analyze and act directly to the root cause uh thanks to this uh this kind of I was printing this map in my when I was responsible for the the stock distribution for deat we were printing the the inventory turnover all the the warehouse in the worldall and you could see okay what was the the efficiency of the inventory turnover and then we could readjust in case of like big gap between a different size but what is important when you see that is like the inventory coming for example for B Brand number one in this specific location because of this 150 days we're going to lose like or we need to invest more money to have more inventory at the global inventory Warehouse level or we we will have out of stock and that's the reason why Belgium is too low is because we send too much stock to the to different sites and we don't have enough at the central Distribution Center okay so if I go back to my site you can check the store inventory Turner site done you can rebalance the stock between transfer so no when you know like okay for example my warehouse in Poland or Greece has too much stock and the one in France or Belgium need more stock you could do like transfer if this is very important for you and if this is not too expensive like when I was writing for the the the retail industry was too expensive so it was better to anticipate to be proactive than to pay this transfer but sometimes you have no choice and that's very not cost effective so be careful with that you also need to review the supply parameters to make sure you don't send too much stock to this specific location that's something you need to adapt and I'm going to give you more details in the next video and you could also that's something you have to be very careful is you need to decrease the minimum shipping quantities it could be mq it could be pallet it could be box but most of the time when I if I go back to this graph this map this kind of site like in this specific example it's because they don't sell enough and just by sending one box or one pilet it's already too much and because of that we have the same problem for one location but it's even worse if you have multiple location and you don't want to send one pet to this uh to this side or to Greece if it's like six years of inventory and sometimes this is the case and people forget that as well so you have to be very careful it's better to ship everything from France maybe pay more in transport and I'm going to give you specific example just after than to try to save like in a what we call out borly times to have okay I want to have a very Express location express delivery with with these specific customers but you need to pay for two or three years more inventory turnover because of that okay so you need to be very clear and you need to find the balance between this uh like delivery time and a cost I'm going to give you example just after but be careful with this minimum or order quantities and once again like we did for shortage management I always recommend to block manual orders if needed and to block specific sites if needed as well if you feel they have way too much talk or they are not responsible you should block them or you should just have something automatic that they don't have any manual operation for that or what I was doing as well is I had this automatic uh for my stock distribution I was saying okay we can send inventory to specific location only if the inventory turnover for every itemp for the minimum quantity that you can send was less than 50 days or one days and if we have had an automatic calculation so it's much more complex things but I was saying okay the minimum quantity is 100 if you can sell this 100 in less than 50 days I send it to you otherwise we ship directly from the central dist distribution Network in in Europe and we were doing express delivery so at the end yes we were losing maybe one day of delivery but at the end it was we were saving so much that it was much more profitable for the whole company so I I was designing this kind of algorithm if you have more questions please send me questions because it's going to be more complex to explain in this specific case all right so that's it for multi inventory optimization this is again a lot of basic actions that will give you a lot of U Clarity and I can tell you most of the time we we tend to send too much inventory to our distribution Network and because of that we need to buy more more and more and at the end of the season we need to do massive promotions uh because of that so I'm going to talk about how to reduce the number of storage point and why you should not open new ones in my next video
in this episode I'm going to talk about should I open more storage location my recommendation from my checklist is definitely you should reduce the number of storage location if you want to optimize your inventory and improve your service this is one of my biggest fight over the last 15 years too many companies and professional Ling because they have more storage location they're going to improve the transport and the service but at the end the consequences for the the inventory level and the service is dramatic so let's get back to this I'm going to give you a lot of examples we're going to do an example in Excel and why it's most of the time it's not a good idea so let's take this example we have a distribution center in um in France and we have this Factory suppliers in China all right we are thinking okay but maybe we should open another location right then we have we can improve the lead time so the benefit to have two sites will be like we will improve the outb transport cost and the customer delivery time if we move from one to two we are getting closer right so we are improving what we call odd Bond transport lead time and the cost because we have the lead time is short like the distance is shorter from the DC to the consumer and that's what many many people will think and they will only take this cost because that's the easy C it's really easy to see this cost but it's not that easy to see what are the the drawbacks by opening two different locations be careful first of all of the real delivery lead time most of the time you say ah I'm getting closer I'm getting two or 300 kilometers closer to my customer so I'm going to divide by two my delivery time and that's a big mistake because most of the time the the total lead time is not only about transport it's about shipment and how fast you're going to ship your products and then you're going to wait for your transport to come then you're going to deliver and you could have like most of the time the shipment Le time is more the transport lead time especially if you move from one big like Factory or distribution center and you move to twoo small you will have less capacity to be you will be less productive so your ship and Le time will probably increase if you move to two small location you you won't be able to work by night you won't have the same efficiency you won't have the same robots etc etc so be very careful when you talk about delivery lead time to consider as well the warehouse lead time okay so what you should do you should track the transport the warehouse the it and the Order review lead time separately to see okay we only going to gain not not in the not in the wor not in the it or how often we're going to raise orders we are only going to gain on the transport time and what will be the real gain for that in terms of cost and in terms of revenue for the business yes if you do like e-commerce delivery if you move from three days to one day you may save money you you make at least the customer may buy more so you need to estimate what will be this impact and what you can do you can test you can do so for example super Express expensive delivery for maybe one week or one month to see what will be the impact on the revenue and if it's working then you can use this total revenue increase versus opening another location so that's something this is for example this dashboard is coming from my course SM metric and we we we are I'm going to explain to you how to track transport and where lead time okay don't forget that to improve the transport lead time you don't need necessary to open a new location you could also do like what we call express delivery by night this is something expensive but most of the time it's cheaper than delivering and opening a new location with like millions of dollars of cost because of that don't forget for example like apple I'm going to talk about Apple at the end of this um presentation is shipping everything from China by plane to the rest of the world and they don't have distribution Network they don't have Warehouse so if Apple can do it yes they do have lot of margin for each products but keep in mind it's much easier to uh to do that than to open a new location on the other side if you keep or like one site you will improve what we call the INB inborn transport cost and INB Le inbone lead time so let's say you had this specific location I could send one container every seven not je seven days I'm going to show you that je is day I forgot to translate that so let's say like you were sending one full container every seven days and now you're are sending one container because you split you have less quantity you're going to send one container to the north every 12 days and one container to the South every 20 days okay so that will be an impact you will you won't have the same frequency and because of that you will also incre increase the warehouse cost because you will have less volumes so it's very important to understand that the biggest is the worst the lower the lowest the lower is the cost for the for your Logistics and the cost per product and per item when you have a w when we talk about Warehouse we have what we call fixed cost so we do have fixed cost and then the more you for example the rent uh very specific like fixed cost to sell just to have the location then the more you will have volume the more you will have to recruit people the more the more you will spend energy you will have also insurance insurance cost etc etc so you'll have we have this linear progression at one point you get almost full to close capacity and in my next episode I'm going to talk about how to track the occupancy rate and boom you're going to start to do like what you call over over storage cost so we're going to you're going to put your your inventory maybe to another words next to you but just just for Overstock you're going to pay extra fee with your 3pm if you are using a 3pl logistic suppliers and at one point boom you say no no I want to open a new house and the the the cost of the new wouse will have another fixed cost before having another curve like this so you have to really keep in mind by by opening a new Warehouse you're going to do like this even if you don't have any more quantities to to ship so you have to be very aware of this so by keeping one site you're going to optimize the we's cost and you're going to also optimize what we call the inventory levels the the volume of inventory and this is something that is not easy to calculate but it can make a huge difference from moving to one to two location if you move to two you will increase by a lot the inventory level for example because of the impact of what we call the minimum order of quantity or or minimum order of of shipment from your suppliers let's say like from this mq at 30 days if you move to two containers you will have 50 days of inventory for example one container one pallet and the other one will be 80 days so you're going to move from 30 days of inventory minimum 2 50 to the north and 80 to the South okay so the impact could be massive if I take this example with like two big DC then distribution Network that was supplying like multiple stores for example in America it's very important to understand like when you when you have new location when you send one pette because most of the time you need to send at least one box of one pallet this one pet for one specific location with a group of customer will be seven days of inventory turn over for another one it will be 90 days and for maybe this one it will be 500 days because you only have few customers related to this specific storage location and that will kill your inventory level and also your service because if you send too much here what we saw before in the shortage management epison you won't have enough year so or you need to buy more here or you'll have less service for your customer and it's it's getting more and more complex the more your P location the more it's getting complex for your customer so what you can do is to reduce the number of location if you move from this to this then you have much more volume link to these specific ws and then you are moving to like from 7 to 90 you moving to 4 days because you can consolidate the volume and same for this one so instead of having two containers with two location I will have only one container that will supply my network directly okay so now let's go back into Excel to give you like how to estimate the impact ofq and minimum order of shipment to your distribution Network so I have a special example for you you go to the right we have what we call the stock distribution and that's a very simple example to show you that okay if you have one Warehouse just with five products that will be the Target stock whatever you have a real the point Mini Max Etc that will be the m q and then what we're going to do we're going to run up the Target stock so you let's say you want 1,000 your mq is 1,000 so your tag St R up to mq because you need to reach the minimum of order of quantity will be 1,000 for this one you need 2,000 quantities but your mq is 2,500 so you will increase your inventory by 500 quantities because of that then you have the unit cost you have The Round Up Target stock and you have the Overstock the Overstock will be the difference between what do you want and what what is impact of your mq so in this specific location we only have two products that we we will have to order more because of the mq this one and this one and the total of a store will be $50,000 now someone in the company say you know what we should open the second location to improve the lead time to our customers and transport great so let's let's say like the volume of the first one will be 60% and the second one will be 40% so I'm just going to divide I just want to keep it very simple but basically when you divide the demand like it's like if you use the REO Point you're going to use average size multiply by 60% and you're going to reduce this so in this specific case I'm just multiplying this Target stock by 60% here and this one by 40% okay the mq is the same because your the the prod is coming from the same supplyer right it could be one pallet one container and the problem is because you reduce the the vol volume of demand your run up Target stock will be the same and your over stock will be much higher you you need 600 but you have 1,000 so in this specific case it was okay now you have another stock of 400 quantities for this one before we had another stock of 500 quantities now we have another stock of 1300 quantities and for this one we have over stock of 6,000 to5 we have another stock of 9,000 quantities so at the end it's going to be more and more like you the the Target stock is what you want to optimize your service and your inventory but at the end because of this round up you are moving to just to worse number one at another stock of $150,000 and for the second one it's even worse because you have 40% of demand so you could play with this number you could say no even it should be 50/50 great if it's 50/50 at the end you have the same impact but the total inventory like Overstock will be 350 $50,000 versus $50,000 here so the total inventory increase will be $300,000 from splitting to one storage location to two storage location so I just wanted to show this example to show you that that could be a massive impact for you and most of the time we forget to think about okay what would we think about okay the cost of delivery is better what is the the lead time is better but what is the real impact for the inventory and most of the time we we forget this one so let's say that we have all of this stock for one world 490,000 now we have two world we need $800,000 the inventory increase is $310,000 so we are increasing by 63% and then you could apply okay but what is the inventory cost the inventory cost would be 12% you could use the same principle than the EQ okay let's say 12 12 12.7% so 12.7% right I know my the cost of my Overstock will be per year $40,000 so this is just one example maybe it will be less on more but I really recommend you to do this kind of analysis I've I've been doing that I will need 20 hours to do this in a large scale but I just want to give you this insights to really understand that this is this is not only about transport saving this is much more complex than that so if I go back to the the benefit yes you do have inventory you will have more I mean you will save inventory if you keep to one site you will also have a better focus accuracy why because it's much easier to do one forecast with big volume than to do a forecast with 60% of the total demand and 40% of the total demand if you sum this two curve here you will have this curve and it's much easier it's like doing the forecast of iPhone for Europe or doing the forus of the iPhone just for Portugal right it's much easier to predict when you have a a lot of volume it's like the global G gdpd gross in the world you we know that the gross of the GPD when you don't have a pandemic or something like that is more or less growing from 1 to 3% a year but what would be the GPD growth of like a country in Africa for example it will be much difficult to predict because it's a small it's small volume and you have more events at the end you have a lot of variation but the global level is always easier to product so if you have 80% of forus accuracy at the total demand you will have maybe 65% for side number one and 50% for side number two so because of the poor forecast accuracy you will you will decrease the quality of your service and also you will have more Overstock because you will have more level of uncertainty right so at the end you you see you we have a lot of benefits to keep it simple forus accuracy and the Simplicity to have only one side is much easier why is it much easier so I was explained that before with Simplicity versus complex C we were talking about parameters but we could also use it for the number of storage location if you have more storage location you need more people you need more it systems you need more invoicing you need more like emails you need more meetings you need more everything you have more challenges regarding the laws the regulation the audits so it's getting more and more complex and sometimes the complexity can just kill you and I've seen many many retail and distribution Network because they were way too complex they want to bankruptcy because of that so keep it simple and also the shorter is the lead time the better is it it's the same for the number of storage location the less your storage location the easier is it and that's why companies like apple and Zara are performing well because they keep it very simple in terms of process team it email forecast shortage management 3pl transport and support for the team so this is really a something I really I wanted to highlight so my conclusion for for that I do have five recommendation before opening a new storage location or definitely you should close one or two if you want to to optimize your inventory first one before opening a new location optimize your inventory first if you feel you're opening because you don't have enough space I can tell you most of the time you can optimize your inventory by 10 to 30% so optimize by tracking your performance reducing your number of reference reducing your mq size improving your focus accuracy and automating your inventory measurement I was talking about this for quite a long time in this course the second one is really to have a total cost of owner ownership approach right keep in mind that it's not only about the cost the cost of your um your inventory uh the cost of your delivery time it's really about the focus accuracy the inventory level the Simplicity this one is in French AIP at human it's just like one of of the benefit of this one would be like you will have smaller team so it will be easier to manage but you'll have more team as well and more people so it's not necessarily a good one my third recommendation is to simulate and test you really need like I did with this Excel spreadsheet you really need to like create all these scenarios and try if you think like you're going to you make more money if you deliver faster yes do a try do express delivery on your website or with your specific customer and see really if you are selling more or not the fourth one and this is one I've been seeing a lot be very careful with personal interest personal motivation interest just to give you one example one of the the person in my previous company he was working on this new opening warehouse distribution Network and he was really pushing to open a new network in America Latina and I was checking the numbers and they were not they were not correct they were not correct because they were not taking into account the the inventory increase the cost of inventory but this person was really really pushing why because this person wanted to open a new Warehouse because it was cool for a LinkedIn profile and CV yeah I open a new DC in America Latina that's cool for my CV but it was really from personal interest and not the benefit and the I would say the the most profitable way for the company you will have the same for Consulting few consulting company of course most of the consultant are very honest but they will push you to open a new location then they have more work to do because they know it's very complex to open new location I did a huge like logistic Network um like Consulting with with with one of the big four companies Consulting companies in the world and they were they were saying me like we we have only one location in Brazil and they were saying yeah you need to open eight new location and it didn't make sense but for them like for me the interest for them was yeah yeah if you open eight location then we needed to find the the the rep to design the network to recruit people and I was a business for them so be very careful with that with personal interest and then my last recomendation is if you are not sure keep it simple if you are not sure you have to open don't open if you are not sure you need to keep 10 location maybe reduce to 9 or eight okay that's my conclusion for that life is easier it's like it's like my conclusion would be like do you want to go shopping to 10 different Supermarket to save one or 2% of purch like do you want to do that or you want to keep it simple go to One location right and spend maybe 10 times less 10 times less uh by shopping into on one location so I really recommend that and my conclusion is Apple Apple has no almost no Distribution Center in the world they ship everything from China to their consumers by plane so I do not recommend this necessar if you don't have the margin and from a like a global warming point of view I don't think this is is a completely responsible but it's a very good way and in the what they are saving the world I don't know the global emission from all this Warehouse logistic they are saving but at one point that would be maybe beneficial that if they could invest in hydrogen and electric plane and they will solve the pro problem for the rest of the world but that's a very good example like Zara they keep it very simple few products few storage location and thanks to that they're ex extremely profitable and Apple has only nine days of in turnover which is amazing
in this episode I'm going to talk about lead times stabilization and reduction from a logistic point of view so I was talking about lead time with the suppliers but I want to go deeper with Logistics stabilization first why because if you if you have before even improving your lead time if they are more stable you need more less safety lead time to face again the level of uncertainty if I go back to my Pro and Safety stock this is the file pro Safety stock the level two you remember I was doing like play on certainty and when they were high had like high safety lead times and this safety lead time will increase my REO point and my re point will increase my inventory level so let's say like if you say for example let's do a simulation re the point so my total this is in quantity but just to give you an IDE because we're not using uh the ROM point is 252,000 quantities if you say tomorrow that okay my supplier pivot let's say that now I'm going to fake this but just to give you an ID now you have to go to 50% boom so we have much more suppliers low and medium now let's do like this up if you have much more suppliers like this like 30 and 50 you go back to your dashboard and you see that we move from 250,000 to 237 quantities of real point so we're going to reduce a lot our um REO point and inventory just by having more like stabilized suppliers okay so that's one example I'm going to go back to these values oops not this one so the first thing we found even before reduction is try to keep it as stable as possible I know this is not simple but that's the first step what you can use also to improve your lead time is to review the frequency because most of the time we forget about it but if you order every day you will improve because in the lead time when we check this lead time you have the review period first right so if you order once a month and you switch to once a week you're going to save a lot of time and this time will improve your inventory level because you don't have to cover from this and many companies they forget about this review period And by improving the frequency you will improve that the problem by increasing the frequency is maybe you're going to lose in terms of Transport cost if you cannot for examp fill one container or one pallette but if you can do it you should try at least with your main suppliers and your main Transport company okay don't forget like in the shipment so you have the frequency then you have the it confirmation then you have the production you have the pecking and packing then you have the waiting then you have the transport then the custom the transport again and the delivery it you you don't need to only optimize the transport you can optimize all of them and see first track which one is the longest one and which one you can can improve sometimes the transport is only one or two days but you your review perod is every every week so you have you can save seven days here and only one or two is transport okay so I go back to this review the frequency check then you can consolidate your supplier delivery to increase the frequency you could say okay for example I had the supplier from Vietnam and from Malaysia and say okay we're going to consolidate in Malaysia and we'll have instead of shipping once a month we're going to ship once a week that's a very good example then you can review the modes of Transport so I was think that before let's say from China you could say okay I was shipping by boat but now I'm going to ship by train and by train or rail the the shipping like the duration was 40 or 55 days and by R it would be 15 or 18 days and by reducing the lead time you're going to reduce your inventory level and also you will improve probably your level of uncertainty because you have your your lead time is shorter as well okay so you have multiple option if you really want to improve like apple you can ship by plane but it's much more expensive in terms of cost I will only doing doing for express delivery or for very like light and iprofit high-profit item great check then you can reduce the non transport delays like communication custom clearance reception I was talking about it before Oh here this is not only about the transport this is also about all this intermediate step check reir the suppliers to store so that's another solution if you feel like you most of the time is from production you could ask to produce in advance maybe share the cost of it and then you could you could ask to the suppli to increase the Safety stock maybe on finish products components etc etc so you have multiple options again I will only focus on my main suppliers with my main products and on this one maybe it's cheaper to store in China than to to store in Europe or in America you could also delay the product different differentiation what we call the made to order is like you could really wait for the last minutes to produce uh the product so it could be like for that you need to really improve your production process I won't have much time for that but you I really recommend you to to Google made to order and you will only produce once you get the order from your customers or you can also improve your process that you use almost all the same components like it's the it's very related to the next one use almost the same components you will just change maybe the colors or the packaging for very specific C customers all right so if you can have a faster production you will also improve your L time you could also change your supplier if necessary with a total cost on ship approach that's something I was mentioning before and don't forget when you change anything here to update your average lead time in your Erp so if I go back for example for to one of this file for example this one don't forget to update your committed lead time in your system if you change the frequency from your review P from for example one month to one week don't forget to update this because otherwise you won't have any impact on your inventory if you don't change what in your system right it makes sense but most of the time we forget about it so that's it for lead time stabilization and reduction I give you a lot of ideas then you need to focus you need to track first what are your main suppliers longer longer L time and what what is what is the biggest opportunity of optimization
next one if you want to optimize your inventory make sure you don't have space it's like having a big house if you have a very small house you won't buy too much stuff you know you you won't store any any stuff you can say oh I don't have space so I'm not going to buy same for dress if you have a big like a dress um room where you can sell a lot of produ you're going to buy more and I really recommend this is the same principle for sulation and for location whatever you have a factory or you have a warehouse uh it's a the more you will have space the more the less you will have pressure to optimize your inventory Toyota is a very good example to the Toyota's factories they don't have space for storage that's why they have an amazing uh inventory turnover in their Factory so I really recommend you to always have this tension of high occup what we call occupancy rate and I really recommend you to calculate what is the average and maximum occupancy rate and always be at the limit and it will be a game changer in your way and in the pressure to imize your inventory so to calculate that I don't have a specific example here but you can we going take the example from myric course and in this one I was just calculating okay per sector what is the occupancy rate sector one two three four five uh we also have a map now we can use this one for example like say this is a map I was creating for for this course and you can see like per location what is the occupancy rate and and usually you have different sectors for different type of products you have the like ethero products you have the small products you have the voluminous products you have the dous product and you want to make sure that you are there is there is not a perfect number but you should be around 80% when you're too full it's very difficult to move products in the world so you're not productive but if you are like a 40 or 50% you you are spending way too much money for your activity and I can tell you if you have space you will have more inventory I was also using this excuse with marketing and I was always saying look we are full so we need to canel products or you need we need to sacrifice products or you need to clean all this obsolete stock so I always recommend you to send this kind of pictures or visual effect to your like marketing and sales team to say like we cannot afford to open the second location because it would cost $5 million so you you have to help me otherwise I won't be able to ship your products and we're going to be late so it's a win-win and I was always using this uh this pressure to explain like look I can't I really want to help you but I'm full I'm completely full and I was very efficient I can tell you so if I go back to my list this is just a few example uh you have like this s occupancy rate from sector one two three four five from the peing and the shipping do the most important obviously is the storage part but you also have to be very aware of the picking shipping and res duck if this is the case and then the okay calculation is just the number of occupied location divided by the number of available location so if I go back to my Excel I can just show you show you another view of occupancy control location stock stock take ABC occupancy yeah I have my pivot table with my sector location and item and this is the number of location for my sector one and this is the number of item that are using my location whatever you have one one quantity or 10 quantity per location uh the occupation rate is not in quantity it's in the number of location occupied okay so you do have this and I really recommend you to First calculate then to maintain like space constraint too much space equal more inventory to liquidate product with less than x quantities on box to free up storage space as well so what is important as well is it's not only about the inventory turnover globally it's like if you most of the time you have maybe 10% of your storage location with maybe one or two products and you really want to clean that because most of the time you have one or two products that are they're going to stay forever and when I was sending I was sending this list to marketing or to my sales team say look I'm going to push all these stocks to my customers for almost free because I'm losing 10% of my capacity just because of one quantity for one lo location when I could have maybe 100 quantity for one location okay so try to clean that clean that also I really recommend you to rent if you have like one location for example you say okay my sector number three has only 30% of occupation I could rent a part of it to another supplier or whatever the IDE is like to be to to increase your level of occupancy by renting what you don't use it's like you have a big house you have four bedrooms and you're going to rent two bedrooms uh to someone else Airbnb then you're going to make more money and maybe you won't make you won't have another baby well I don't say you don't have to you don't you don't need to have another baby but you yeah you could do the same for your dress you know or for your for your clothes if you rent a storage like let's say you have a storage in your garden where you are storing a lot of unnecessary stuff if you just close it or you rent it to your neighborh they won't you you won't have this tendency to buy more products to put it in this storage a okay that's a better example cool I save myself don't judge me okay and there is another possibility so you can rent un unoccupied storage capacity or you could also move to a smaller location if you only use 40% of this location and you don't have like huge like expectation to to gross for gross for the next few years just move to a smaller location and I can tell you once again this the more your Your Capacity is used the less you will have this tendency to increase your your storage location once again also what is very efficient is to have your team very close to your um to your Warehouse when you see the inventory you you increase the stress level and I can tell you that you have this tendency as well to reduce the inventory so I'm going to add this checklist as well I'm going to tell you walk visit and work close to your stock to your inventory and just by seeing this you you you will see much more over stock and you will try to clean it as fast as possible so that's it for the storage capacity reduction and I see you for another episode
in this module we're going to talk about automation software and Innovation so many of you ask me Ed what about machine learning AI blockchain RFID and yes we're going to talk about it and I'm going to share my personal experience from Consulting I've been also in contact with a very like smart people and tech companies so I'm going to give you my insight but first of all before all this Innovations we have to keep it simple once again because we want to have short-term results so we're going to talk first about how to keep the data claim to automate this file again and then we're going to go to medium and long-term gain with all this in Innovation coming to the market but first of all let's go back to the basics keep your data clean so how do we keep our data clean first of all it's really so this is a checklist once again I really ask you to respect even even before starting a blockchain or machine learning first of all you need to maintain unique data file format and file names so when I go back to the experts data exper make sure you don't change the name the structure the the name of the column so for example if I go to this file if you change the format of this period if you change the format the name of the column if you change the name of this spreadsheet whatever you're getting a CSV file a text file an Excel file or you connect directly to your Erp you're going to have big problems if you don't respect that so make sure that's why my recommendation to extract directly from your system without touching touching anything and then you can clean automatically with with micro powerquery or manually but please uh be very careful with that so I go back to the checklist the second one is to protect your file with password so if you have many like if you have a big company it's it's good to protect your file to make sure that only the the person responsible for example for Safety stock uh do it do it uh with responsibility if you give access to Commercial and marketing maybe they could have access to update the the code mode but be careful because sometimes I had multiple issues because everyone had access and people were changing the code model or the price directly in this file so I will have a very specific process on how to protect an Excel file you have multiple option you can protect the structure of your file like you go to review you can protect the workbook if you protect the workbook you just um insert the password and you will uh people basically won't be able to I'm going to do it with you if you do like this a AA a AA if you do like this people W won't be able to create new tab okay I don't feel this is very useful so I'm going to remove this one up okay then you can protect the sheet and if you protect the sheet you can say you can select what people can do or cannot do if I do like this okay now you see this is blocked if you want to unblock a specific formula for example let's say ah no d need to check this formula you you go to so let's un protect first you say no I don't want them to touch anything except my checklist so we can go back to this format sales you go to protection and you say unlocked here okay you you select here then when you go back to protect sheet okay so now if I want to change the account but usually if I go here I can do it you see so it's very useful if you want for example you say no they can change everything except for example I don't know the the code or a specific information the price but they cannot change anything else that's something very useful okay so I'm going to remove this again to keep it simple and protect sheet okay so that's that's the first way but the most useful way from my personal experience is to protect the full uh workbook when you open it and also to recommend red only so how do do that that is something very useful you should U you should look and do especially if you have multiple person in your company you go to f file save as and when you go to save as if I'm using the latest Exel version if it may be different if you have another Excel version you just Google it or to protect my file you go to more options and then you have to go to tools and general options here okay and then what is I feel very useful so you could have a if you do you have something confidential that you want and anyone to have access you can add the password to open but what I feel very useful is the password to modify so I feel it's important that everyone has access to the same information for example you need to know what's the stock when is the next order coming so usually I don't I don't protect to open I only protect to modify so what I'm going to do I'm going to do just a a AA this is my password don't use this password and then I I'm going to check red only recommending and then okay okay you need to repeat this and I'm going to call it password or protect protect cool great very good I'm I'm going to close it oops and let's open it again this one protect what I feel very useful is you see like oh if I don't have the pass on I click rly I have too many Excel open that's why you see like it's only red only so whatever if I want to do something and I want to save for example let's save you say oh it's only red only so they can create a copy but this they can they cannot change the source file which is very important right so that's a really important Excel trick that you want to use and of course if you so I'm going to remove this and if you let's go back to the file and say okay I know the password is a AA and you press okay and then you will ask you okay but do you really want to I I Al that's why I check the box you really want to change the file or open as R only you say no open you say no and when you click no then you can change the file and I only recommend to give access to the supply sh team for example because we can trust people in supply chain and finance okay but not marketing not sales between us okay so that's it for the the data protection so I hope this is clear this is a very useful trick I'm going to go back to the previous version not protected okay T tac tac T tac tac cool so this is a very important one then what is important to keep your data clean you need to Define homogenous product groups so I was talking about that during the seasonality but I feel this is something very important when you create seasonality like this ones uh each time you have a new product this is very important that you really think about okay which categories is if the this new products is really will have the same behavior than the same category if we are using seasonality for per brown or per category this is critical you don't want to mix Summer product with winter products you want to have as homogene homogeneous I don't know how to spell this this name but similar product with similar Behavior then you can use the seasonality for example for the forecast for your mini Maxi whatever you're using so keep this in mind great next checklist don't change item Cod I was talking about it for new products this is a nightmare when you change item because when you change also the category structure marketing and sales they love especially marketing and the product management team they love to create new codes because yeah this is a new code there is a new packaging so we're going to change everything it's a nightmare for season for forecasting seasonality you don't have any link you need to duplicate your your row so try to always fight back when someone wants to create a new code just say no first and then they have to really convince you and you can say if you do it I won't have stock for you and most of the time there is it's easy for it's easier for them it's it's a nightmare for us so really f with that another important thing do not change the cap calculation method so maybe you say Okay d you have your one way to calculate inventory to another maybe we should take say six months one year or maybe for I don't know inventory accuracy there is another way Focus accuracy we take the focus one month before or not be very careful to do not change every every calculation because you won't be able to compare your results so even if this is not perfect I really recommend not to change unless this is completely wrong because at the end if you don't if you don't know what was your availability last year here your field rate and you change completely your rules if you have 10 points in Fr you cannot explain is it an improvement this is just a calculation effect right so that's another safety rule but don't try to be perfect and become an expert by changing everything all the time another thing that I'm I'm going to repeat again consolidate your data in a single database once again this is much easier to have all your information into one database you could also use what we call data Lake uh data Lake if I Google it thata L you could do it in Excel obviously this is what we we've done with this file this is all basically we consolidate all the information into one place you could use it with parium we get back to this or you could ask your it Department to create what we call a data Lake to have all even if your data is not clean or structured you could send everything to one it's like a lake it's like a big Warehouse with all information into one place which is that much easier to connect so I recommend you to check this keyword if you want to know more about it um you will have you have a lot of information but most of the time we start with Excel and then we move to multiple it solution or you could also combine with multiple query from sap Oracle or whatever is your your tool right okay so that's another like like very important point to check and uh the last one regarding data is to keep as much history as possible regarding sales price stock service rate availability rate I recommend five years per item if you can have it if you can afford to it the most important one by far is are the sales then I will use the price the stock is less important at the itm level because what is important is today and the the last 12 months then you can keep the stock at the category level if you want to calculate um the stock Target Etc but I feel like sales price and if possible service rate and avability rate is something that you that is very useful if you want to really track your performance also adjust and for example if you have also like strong seasonality but with very specific events that you want to clean the more you will have history the the much easier will be but once again you need to have a structure of your data that is that doesn't change like we were talking about don't change item cost don't change the the product category or don't create a new category every year because otherwise you won't be able to compare from last year okay so that was my basic check to make sure that you have sustainable and clean data on the on the short term but only on the long term and in the next video I'm going to talk about automation again
Next Step we're going to talk about automation for this file first and then outside this file uh I've been talking about it before so I'm going to go fast the first thing if you want to automate is to make sure you have all your data standard so I was talking about that before but if you if you don't have like your your data is moving all the time the folders the name I was talking about it you can't really automate so keep it as standard and as as clean as possible don't change the name of the file don't put the number the name of the months and this is this is the first step the second one you can you have multiple way to automate you could automate with formula for example you could you have let's say you have one file with stock one file with sales and you could do V lookup between two separate Excel file I do not recommend this uh solution because it will slow down the file and I feel this is not a very efficient way now because we have power query for example but that's a way so you could automate with different formulas you could automate with Excel macro so for example if you do contrl c control V from different files if you don't want to use Pro query and you want to open this file you could say Okay I want I don't want to do it manually so I'm going to create something who will copy and paste so I'm going to show you one example from my Excel course uh this one let's say like you have this one is in French but I have the same in English let's say like you have three different files margin stock and va va is sales like it's French free French course for you um so you have these three files and you want to consolidate into uh like you want to copy this one here this one here and this one here and then you want to consolidate all of it you could do it like one by one and this is the location of the file I click in this button up see let's see if it's working yes it's working so now I have this one automatically so you you open the file you did contrl c contrl v and close the file or you could do it all together you just click here and you will you will do a the three files in the same times cool and now it's done VOA so that was with the the macro I was using a lot of macro before I was the king of macro and I'm going to teach you how to do it if you want to join my my Excel course but I do feel like right now it's even more efficient most of the time with SP query and this is the next step you can click on this uh link if you want to discover my new course but the new one is a powerquery and I did a specific bonus I didn't reveal the full potential of powerquery and power pivot but I feel this is a good introduction if you if you feel more attracted to it I can explain to you the full methodology so with powerquery you can check the introduction of this file I was explaining how to use Pro query to start and I'm going to do another bonus for the pro version just to give you more more more information because this is for me lifechanging to use P this is super efficient much faster like much easier I F an Excel macro and for that for example for this specific file we do have power query we just click on refresh all and that's it uh just to show you another example for example from uh this is from SM metrix if you want to go much further with power query you can also check mymetric course and I'm doing for example much more I'm creating Ki directly into my uh into Pro cor and power pivot I can link different tables so they are all together and I can also do a v cup it's not vup I'm not using V cup anymore I'm going to combine for example stock price sales and other type directly into par without doing any vup so it's even more faster and efficient and um that's why I recommend this one if you want to go even further this is not that complex but if if you want you can go to see my smri CSE or Excel you don't necessarily need that but it's even more if ient if you want to really keep it as automatic as possible okay so that's it for my recommendation to automate this different file I do recommend power query this is the for me the fastest way and this is also much easier than you think
Next Step I'm going to go back to why it's important to automate your inventory management with one specific case study from Zara so maybe you know this example from my webinar but I just wanted to go back to this because I've been working with the MIT for more than two years and I had the chance to be part of this uh so the MIT was working with Zara and they did a big study to uh really really estimate why the human being was not good in inventory management manually what would could be the benefit for that so I recommend this this study this is not quite this is not recent but all the fundamentals are here uh this is from Jeremy Gan was the the the director of research in Supply CH at the MIT and I was working with this with this expert for for more than two years and it's it's an amazing person very passionate about sulation so I'm going to put the link in my file and what what was about the study but before Z the fashion store they all the inventory like manually and managed from the the store manager and we also had like the wor team who was allocating stock manually as well and I was not efficient and they did a long um study like scientific study why why they could not do it properly and basically the problem of the this is all the problem of the we do have as a human first of all we tend to overestimate the need we have a fear of shortage first first or first sved we only have a premium and bonus on sales we have unlimited stock budget most of the time the Sal team don't have any goals for inventory level we tend to overreact we are not expert we have probably too many parameters we are too slow we are understa we have we are not enough people too many skes too many priorities we only work from 8 to 15 hours a day we don't have access to all the information we have issues between interface between system uh Excel Erp and we don't have Global optimization and the conclusion was okay we can't only trust human to manage inventory and they move to an automatic system who is quite similar to the principle I've been showing you today more complex because they're using more tools and models for the forecasting part but at the end was the same principle and the idea was really to First Forecast everything automatically and then to use an optimization model to also manage shortage management and the implementation of the implementation of the project just after that they made 120 Millions net profit and that was a huge gain for this company at this time and that was a long time ago and today like it would be like something like 500 Millions profit because every year you keep the same profit I had the same project with the cat and we saved just after implementation something like 150 Millions Euros of inventory after implementation it will be much more today so that was just a good example also just to give you like a another story they have this also automatic model that say like if you don't have the central size in the store automatically the system will ask you to move the stock to the room to the back room because they don't want to have frustration when they don't have a medium size and that will automatically um call new products to make sure that you always you're always satisfied when you find your central size they also they did a study which is not super super cool that they say like it's okay to uh you don't have large size extra large size or extra small size because people will be will feel more guilty about their size or shape if they don't find for example extra large or extra small then Central size will people will complain about the company so which this is another study about that and um it's I don't think this is super cool but this is the reality of this uh of this um long research what is also interesting is like the more your inventory management is automatic the more you react and not overreact and one during the last pandemic Zara had huge impact on their sales that to close many stores in the world but they managed thanks to their very short lead time and automatic inventory to reduce their inventory by more than 19% and 500 Millions uh which was like it was a amazing performance regarding the the impact and also the speed of this pandemic in the world so that's another reason why you should automate your inventory so if I'm talking about this is like you could do it with Excel with an ARP at the end what is important is you make it as automatic as possible and you will only manage by exception so what you could do for example when you run this file you could say okay I'm going to I'm going to trust 100% of it I will just maybe double check all my orders more than oop more than uh for example 50,000 or $10,000 I will not check everything automatic and if you have a specific promotion or a specific action with one of your factory or retail store you will do it manually also it's important if you can also automate your forecast um I do have an introduction of forecasting in this uh in this tutorial you could check if you want to know more about forecasting with Excel you can download this Excel and I will talk more about how to automatically forecast you can check of course that this other tool but I will tell you more about forecasting in my next course forecasting expert but try to keep it as automatic as possible and once again 95 to 99% and the rest should be um should be like but just by exception that will completely change your life the next will be to calculate and animate the percentage of automatic and manual order uh it's really important that you will understand if like your team is always changing you could have a recommendation from this file but how often your team doesn't trust and change manually the orders so we can call this percentage of automatic or percentage of manual order I did example in this uh file for example from SM metrix just to give you an Ida you could see like okay we do have 25% of manual order this is coming for example from um retail stores and you can see like okay automatic is uh 61% HQ is like it's coming from the central like DC so people in the in the warehouse we push stock to the stores and we do have it's not 25 it's yeah yeah we do have sorry 25% manual and 14% from the the central that's this kind of cap that can be useful the the best for that is like each time you create an order your system will tag if it's manual automatic or if it's pushing it's a push from the head quarter for example another example is for like the if you have a demand planning team you could also track what is the percentage of order that was not changed from the recommendation of the system so you do have a recommendation from the system based on your current forecast and you have this percentage of auto automatic order per demand planner and for example Zan uh tends to change all the recommendation because it doesn't trust the system and beyon is pretty good with 71% when you change the system is because most of the time you didn't update your parameters you didn't update your forecast properly so you have to change oh no I need more I need less so that's also a very good capier that I recommend to to use if you know if you want to know more about this C you can also follow my course um SM metrics but this is just to give you an ID and you need a system to track uh this okay so that was three example I recommend I gave you more links if you want to know more about it and I'm going to see you for the next video
okay in this video we're going to talk about Automation and how to leave Excel because yes I do have a love affair with Excel but it's possible to work without Excel as well I'm not I'm not sponsored by Microsoft to say that and the the focus is really to focus on analysis and decision making and not wasting your time with spreadsheet or looking for the best transaction into your sap or Oracle Erp okay so the first solution was taking the data from your IP analyze decide and then send it back to your to your system by the way just to show something you could also if you go to data get data from file you could also connect from if you use perer you could also connect from your database or from aure or you could also use different platform for examp you could basically do almost everything so you could connect still use Excel but get all your data directly from uh this file into your system you need more access obviously this is more complex and really depend on your access your company but it's much more powerful than you think if I go back to the the solution the solution two I was explaining that before is to use Excel as a specifications I I like to design everything and really train the team because most of the time it's easier to train the team with Excel you can also simulate what would be the impact in terms of safety in terms of cost all the visual for the dashboard and then when you feel ready you can give it this to your it department or maybe to a consultant who is responsible for what we call business intelligence reporting and automation but it will be much faster and easier you will save so much money if you already have all the specification in Excel because you have all the data and all the calculation as well okay so that's the two solution I recommend the next question will be back okay Ed what do I do for my what do I do like which software should I use right so this is a long-term decision this is not easy to change or to start using a new a or WMS uh I did you can check my article again how to choose the right European inventory measurement software this is there is no one perfect solution I can tell you there is no one perfect solution people always ask me what is the best it really depends on so many aspects first of all what do you want to do with this software do you just want to calculate the Safety stock do you want to do forecast do you want to also manage all the the invoicing the ion the followup with your suppliers so it really depends what you want to do first then what will be the size of your company because between like a very small for example e-commerce company using Shopify and having like a big multinational working 50 different countries you don't have the same option if you have a global company you only have two I would say two options on the market it's sap or recel because that's the only one who are able to manage all this complexity all the fiscal and all the tax issues ETC Etc in Brazil we had more than 100 different 100 change the low we had 100 different modification per day um from the government uh just from the fiscal and regulation part and sap was one the only company who was able to follow the pace of all this change so we are no Cho that to work with sap which is a problem because when you have only one company you have a monopoly you tend to to pay too much for the service and the service is not evolving that fast because there is no much competition so I do have a problem with sap because they're not evolving fast they have a monopoly position and they also know it's very difficult to leave sap as well so I I do love sap for many reason but also don't like sip because of their lack of user interface their lack of Automation and because they have a monopoly on the for the big and the mediumsized company in the world then the budget also will completely different between buying sap and using like a Shopify module to manage your inventory so the budget will be very different so what how much are you ready to invest and what will be the the the scope of the project then you have multiple way what you want to do like you want to buy a a software or you want to use it as a SAS software as a service and you you're going to pay a monthly fee I do recommend this if you are not working with Excel this is the because you have a regular support and update but what I recommend really is like the best the best solution for me is to find companies similar companies to your company like if you're work in the retail for example find retail company with your size and your kind of products and ask them contact them and say okay which software are you using how was the installation in the implementation process what were the main difficulties what what if if how much did you customize a lot the the solution and was it like ready to go if yes why what was the impact on the teams productivity because sometimes you feel it's more productive but like if you implement something like sap most of the time you need to recruit people because you have more work to do what would be the cost on the maintenance what were the results and at the end if this company really recommend this and for me that was always the best process because if you only ask to the commercial team from specific ARP they will always tell you yeah this is the best solution everything is possible I remember I had a very specific presentation from a very famous company and they were showing like an amazing de demo of their software with this Dynamic dashboard everything was perfect on the commercial presentation but at the end I understood like it was it was completely a made off that was like just like a show off just to for to impress the customer but behind it was only specification and it was basically impossible to implement so be very careful with commercial they they have a bonus to sell you to convince you not uh after implementation and most of the time this the reality is much difficult and you could also i' I've seen company going to bankruptcy just because of Erp integration so go step by step also I do recommend to always invol involve when you have this decision these projects always involve the most the best um players and expert in your team because this is a very difficult project and most of the time these people are not reward because it's like it's a two three years project if you work for a big company it's very intense and I really recommend you to have your best players to recruit more people to make sure that the operations are still running because most of the time we we don't have enough people so we have to the same team to manage operations plus the transition of the of the system and it's a nightmare so you should be ready for that but all really the best people uh in this projects give bonus and incentive with the if the the project is a success and that's a that's a journey again so take your take your time and make sure you can try your feedback before you fully implement this solution but I do recommend at the end I don't I feel like Excel is a it's a beautiful tool for education to work but if you have an option to fully automatic to fully automate what you have to do except maybe for analysis I do feel like Excel is a very powerful tool for analysis I would definitely recommend to move to to a software so check this I plan also maybe to do more content the problem is that many companies asking me uh like software company to promote their solution and I don't like to promote one specific solution because I didn't try all of them and the version can be very different so uh good luck with your project but this is a beautiful uh this is a beautiful project as well that you can Implement to start from Excel and then Implement a software in your uh company I've been running a lot of projects like this and they are all the fent in the next video I'm going to talk about machine learning
in this video I'm going to talk about machine learning and AI everyone is talking about it this is the best world and I many people contacting me Ed can you help me to implement machine learning to improve the performance of my sulation and I just smil and said okay and I always ask okay but what are the performance of your supply chain right now and I say okay can you give me your service your inventory turn over your stock Target how do you manage inventory today for example and most of the time I don't have any answer and say no I don't know but I want to use machine learning and you you just have to be very careful because everyone is talking about it but no one almost no one in the world except Amazon is really using it at the large scale because it's not as easy so I was talking before about Simplicity and versus complexity the more you're going to use parameters the more it's going to be complex and if it's too complex of if one of the data is not clean you're going to crash your performance and this is the same for machine learning and AI it could be extremely efficient and powerful but if you're not ready for it it's going to be even worse than if you use four or five parameters and I've been working with multiple projects with a very very poor performance versus using minmax or dynamic Safety stock for example so my point of view is that is go step by step first of all if you apply even 50% of the fundamentals I was explaining during this course you will have much more performance by just just by trying to implement machine learning which is very complex to implement if you want to implement at a global level of course you could start I feel that this is very exciting to use machine learning Al this is a very exciting uh project for your team I would definitely recommend to start only with the forecast because forecast is much easier you don't have that much data than Inventory management and I do feel as well from my personal experience from Inventory management it's it's very logical you don't need much uh machine learning to really optimize and machine learning is not that smart for that so my point of view regarding machine learning I'm going to give you a few insights that this is what people think so this is one of the company um at one point I was close to work for this company before selling ABC SP that was a that was very close but I decided to create my own own business and school but that's what people would see like okay you will ask a question how can I reduce my working capital and the Machine will tell you okay you need to transfer your inventory from Santio to Po and basically the machine will tell you exactly what to do for everything so this is the dream this is what everyone wants or something like this like for example hey what is my forecast okay on track blah blah blah and you will have all this information and you will just chill drink a coffee and you basically you won't have any employees because all the machine will do the job for you this is what people think but this is like to go to this point this is extremely difficult and we are really far from this today machine learning if I go back from the the principle and I plan to do maybe one day a specific course for the one who really want to experiment machine learning uh I know you need more knowledge and you need to be able to understand the data so you know my pedagogy I will do it one day but it will be simple in less than 20 hours so I need something like 1,000 hours to to make it simple so this is not my priority today you will have much more profit with applying my Excel and my methodology but this is something I'm going to do one day and I'm going to let you know first of all I'm going to talk about forecast and then machine learning but in this specific example what do you have to understand with machine learning you have different way of machine learning you have what we call it's not really machine learning is like optimizing and trying to to try to apply different methods let's say to keep it simple what what I will do first is it's not even machine learning when I say oh you have multiple method to calculate your safety stock and uh or for example to calculate your forecast and what I will do first you have it's not really machine learning I will just let's say you have Android models on the market you will simulate the Android models for every single SKU and you will always use the the best one for the focus accuracy or for the avability or for the the parameters you want to improve this is more like models models optimization than machine learning but that will be the the first step is to experiment as many model as possible and use the most profitable and to have it in a dynamic way then the next step will be to use what we call machine learning and for machine learning I will use what do you have to understand from machine learning from I try to keep it very simple is machine learning is very powerful but stupid so what is going to do machine learning for example you're going to give okay let's do it for forecast because it's much easier for forecast I'm going to give you my sales quantity see my average price and for example I don't know something like how many uh how many clients I I using my selling my products so you're going to give like data at the beginning what we call input and then what is going to do machiney is going to multiply all your information like sales quantity price uh weather forecast if you want and it will multiply by random number and then at the end will you will have a result and you will calculate the result if the results as a good for example forast accuracy based on your sales history so you will do that manually and randomly and you will do it in M like one million or 10 Millions different ways and at one point you will find one way which is quite accurate but you cannot really explain why what is the formula B it's not like average size multiply by price it would be like uh 1.27 multiply by the the Sal quantity minus square root of blah blah blah but this is like this is a black box you don't really understand but at the end it will the more you will have data and the more you will play different scenario the more you will have chance to have something that will give you an accurate forecast for example so that's to keep it simple our machine learning work that's why when for example Facebook is using machine learning or Google no one really knows how it works it just works okay and at the end what we're going to do we're going to you have to tell to the machine learning okay what do you want to optimize is it The Profit the cash flow the forecast accuracy and you will have this black box who will tell you okay give me this data and I'm going to give you this result but it's not as obvious as you may think and it's very like mono like monot task will only do one okay I'm going to calculate the forecast with this specific format but it won't like give you the full uh view of okay how you need to improve your supply chain so if you're a consultant today or Supply CH manager now we still have a lot of jobs for the for the next 30 or 50 years but that's something very powerful and I will definitely start not with inventory management because this is more complex and also easier to to optimize I would definitely start with forecast if I had to start with something just to uh manipulate and learn how to use it and I will only start with permanent products with sales history I will definitely not start with new products I've been working with machine learning for new products it's extremely uh difficult even like Amazon I have many few friends working with Amazon in forecasting a machine learning and even for Amazon this is very difficult to forecast new products okay so then we have multiple way to do it uh most of the machine learning in supply chain is used uh what we call the long the language programming language Python and for python there is a free open source Library called Ponda and this is the one uh I will probably use for my next course when the course will come give me some sometimes before also I've been working with for example Amazon Sage maker who is using python as well but they have like pre like pre-train model that will give you save your time it's more complex to use but it's more powerful and you can use it for multiple scenarios like forecasting or like car plate detection voice recognation etc etc this is something very very exciting uh but just to keep you very like to be very with you if you have if you the maturity of your inventory management is not great today you will have much more profit by keeping it very simple with your team and I will use machine learning as a challenge for your team as a learning process for your team maybe few hours a week uh to experiment play but I will only focus first on the uh forecast so that's was my introduction for machine learning I can't wait to share more about it on YouTube and for my next course let let me know if you want to know more about it as well I may start maybe a waiting list uh to see if you have people interested to join this new methodology but I will need something like one or 2,000 hours to keep it very simple for you again
another projects longterm that you can Implement is to use RFID so radio frequency identification this is a very powerful technology that I'm going to explain I was responsible for the implementation of this technology for Decat so what is um RFID is radio frequency identification this is a tag that you're going to put on your products or box and Palace and you will improve the traceability and I'm going to I'm going to use the this example from the cat because they were one of the first with Walmart in world to really use it at a large scale because you do have a cost for the tag the cost at at the time before was something like 12 cents so you say okay I'm going to spend 12 cents multiply by 1 billion quantities that's a that's a big cost but at the end you have a lot of benefits and the first first of all you have benefits for the the customers and you have benefits for the the employees and also for the efficiency of your company what are the benefits for example if you have a retail company you will have you will know exactly what which products are available you will have a quick and easy check o quick and easy check out process for example you're going to put all your products into uh the the machine you don't have to scan your product one by one so it will be much faster for your customer you will have more like um followup and tracability regarding okay how to use the products or to recycle the products or to um all the description and ingredients for example if you're in the food industry will be much efficient in term of traceability and efficiency and you will have more much more efficiency in the after sale you don't have to remember oh I lost my ticket so I can't have any refund or return in my in my store but the main benefits are for the the company and I'm going to show you this so I've been working these projects in the imple implementation it's a very long-term project because you need to ask to your suppliers you have two options or you do it directly in your Warehouse so you're going to receive the products and you're going to tag manually all your products this is a good way to start and we start it like like this because it was impossible to us to all the suppliers to do it instantly and if you want to do a test projects I will definitely tag first try to see what will be the benefit and then if it's working I will ask to my supplier the problem is if you're not a big company if you represent 1% of the volume of your supplier that this is not easy to ask or you would need to pay the price for that deat long is one of the global leader they have some more than 20 billions of Revenue and something like more than two billions of quantities so they they have the the size so they could really like uh ask to their suppliers to really impose like if you don't do it we stop working with you and that was the same for Walmart for example so it's much easier if you're a big company say look or you do it or we stop working with you of course you do have benefits and the suppliers will have benefits for the the trustability uh the return Etc but that's a cost that you need to share and you need to for your for your supply chain so for the industry point of view you will have more like you will have to take the products and to you will have a better tracability for the shipping control then in the warehouse it will be much easier to receive to to check the quality of your delivery if you don't have it would be much easier to count to make sure you have the right quantity inventory inventory check for me is the most important profit what we call stock Tech it takes forever to control the quality of the products but if you have tags it could be completely instant you just have to be careful if you have metallic product with meta sometimes it doesn't work but uh the last few years the technology really improved I know it's much more efficient than before so for inventory check shipping control uh also from a safety point of view it's much um efficient in the in the W and also in the store you have a lot of uh for example now you can we had a socer b and we were putting the tag inside the ball so it was impossible for someone to remove the stickers and go outside the store and uh the the percentage of what we call anti of ss or people will stall the produ was much lower than to this technology so it's much more efficient in the in the warehouse and in the store just to show you like few example that was for example this is a Deaton this Pingus company you just put all your products inside and you don't need to scan it will immediately tell you okay this is all the products you have and then it will give you the price and you you don't even need a receipt because they already know if you just put your email address that this is the the unique product because every tag is different so you know exactly which product was the one that you you bought and not only the full series when you have a back code you have the same back code for one for the same one million products but when you have an RFID every product is different so it's much easier for the for the followup and also if you have any quality issues or that you need to send back to to your suppliers you know exactly which batch you have to change so that's one benefit the other one will be for example this machine so that's new de as well and this machine will do the inventory check the stock Tech instead of uh asking people to check manually so they will come around the the store and they will con consistently check the quality of your inventory and I can tell you like especially in retail you have something like 20% or 30% of the the inventory is not is not accurate and because of that your replenishment is not accurate and because of that uh you have some estimation that said that you can lose from 5 to 20% of your Revenue because you don't have um the right inventory accuracy so by having having this technology you need to invest more but the return on investment long term can be amazing in terms of productivity quality of your inventory so better service for your customers and better revenue and also profit for your your company this is like a three to 5 years project for Decat long they're working on that for the last 10 years and you also need to consider that don't put this tag only on the products that are profitable you really need to have this policy to say okay I'm going to put it on all my products even if my you could have for that cost1 and if if you had a tag that cost 5 Cent you could say no I'm going to I'm going to lose margin because it's not profitable for a very low price product but it's better to have it on 100% of your products than you don't have you only have 1% then to have like something like 80% of your prodcts have RF id and the rest don't have RF id and then you see have people need to count but they don't know which prods they have to to control so do press series and try first on a very specific location calculate the profitability in dep of inventory accuracy cost productivity and then duplicate for all your products if you really want to have the full benefits of this technology but this is something I really recommend as a long-term projects for stock Tech easy check out if you have retail stores for example for your logistic and transport tracking to prevent theft the theft I cannot pronounce this this name French we cannot pronounce we cannot pronounce th I don't know why and also to improve the traceability and the visibility of your product so keep in mind this is a long-term project but this is an exciting one as well
in this episode I'm going to talk about blockchain why you should use blockchain or not I was talking about machine learning before this is another buzz word and I had also many people Ed I want to use blockchain I want to be part of it cool so I'm going to talk about it I recommend to check this YouTube video I did with my friend an article zga ziga is the font of origin Trail and this is what that was one of the first company to use blockchain on real project this is not a crypto compan this is a company who is doing real projects and I'm not sponsored by this company this is a friend and they they're working on relevant projects with big company like orle or Walmart for example and watch this video if you want to know want to know more about it but what is blockchain first of all blockchain I like this uh definition is to deliver trust between different parting exchanging data for example between a supplier and a a factory customers Etc and we're going to use blockchain to deliver trust because we have a problem of trust and quality of data so the next question is what is the difference between blockchain and database this is a database so you're going to send all this information into one database and Excel could be a database and the blockchain is different is you you're going to share the same everyone will own the database and it will be a distributed database okay so it's not like having one excel in one location if I want to keep it simple everyone is like sharing a shared Excel and when you update one when you update this one all this one are up up to date as well in the same time so you cannot change um you cannot change the information just for you everyone will know when you do something in this specific uh location and everyone is responsible for it so that's the main difference we can use it for Bitcoin or crypto but this is not the the point of today but they're using the same principle of Technology the really question is how can I use blockchain and you have multiple um multiple way to to use blockchain but the best way for me you will be to uh improve the traceability and also to improve like the three main problems that you going to solve are making data more coherent and because most of the time the data is not structured well so it's it's a mess you have data everywhere so the good way with blockchain is is going to bring a lot of attention to the quality of the data and most of most of the time data is boring and no one wants to take care of it and I feel like even if you not you're not using blockchain just by using this word and having this kind of project you're going to focus really on the quality of the data and that that's why I really love blockchain it's more for the the ID to make again to have the focus on what is important and the data is critical than just the the technology itself so you have the D the data is not structural well the second one is people don't trust the data it's the case for example if you have multiple suppliers in the world and you don't really trust the information uh for example this company was working to improve the the trustability of beef or the diamond or raw materials from coming from specific country and the less you trust the more it's useful to use a blockchain to make sure that everyone is um has the same level of information and the next one is to improve the data inter interoperability so what is interoperability is uh instead of having like we call Silo of data you're going to really combine them two into one uh you're going to connect all of them and make sure that they are all connecting and um they have the right interface between each each of them okay so that's the three main benefits I feel from the supply chain in terms of for the blockchain for the supply chain at the end you have a lot of projects running I didn't see that many projects to be honest most of the time I feel like having one Central that database is enough you don't need to share all your information because it this is more costly and more complex as well to implement so I will focus first on having one Central database and then if you really want to if you have really problem of tressing where this information is coming from and you also want to share this information with your suppliers and customers I think this is a a good project that you could Implement and I will start with a very small example maybe one product or one supplier and see how how it goes to to then duplicate to the rest but I will definitely not use the blockchain to manage all your data and all your information because this is much slower this is also more expensive and I but once again my conclusion of blockchain is this is another project that you could explore uh you should also have more education you should find I'm not doing education on blockchain but you should have like at least introduction Workshop or what could be the benefit but for me the main benefit of blockchain is is bring the quality of the data uh in like and as a priority for for the company and uh whatever using blockchain or Excel or any kind of database at the end it will be for for the benefit of your company and also for the people working to improve the quality of the data so check this article and my video uh it will tell you more about it and if you have more question you can contact us and I can also um give you more contacts regarding this new technology is just the beginning I feel we'll have much more Innovations coming the real question is who will own the who who are the companies who will own this technology a big operation like Amazon or Microsoft or it if it will be completely decentralized I do feel like blockchain should be completely decentralized uh but at one point when you have a company you also want to have control so that's why I don't feel like most of the the application will be we will have application but you don't need blockchain for all to manage all your data okay so that was my conclusion for blockchain I will probably do more content about it and that's it for the Innovations
in this module last module not the least important by far we're going to talk about communication and action plan it's great that you have all these Excel and tools to improve uh your supply chain performance the the service the inventory level but you need the support of all the department all the people around you your managers the directors production finance and for that you need to have a clear action plan and I can tell you most of the the exper supply CH they really forget or they don't really care about this one this is for me the the most important I do feel why I had a fast career in ination and all the operation is because I was good to communicate even if I have a French accent okay so I'm going to share with you my my secret my I'm going to show you a template I was using as a consultant and as an snop management director for example I'm going to give you all the tricks to make it as efficient and sharp as possible because what you're going to communicate is what's going to reflect who you are if you have if you have a strong leadership if you're ready for the next maybe a job promotions and also for example if you're a consultant this is where you're going to get the trust of your customers and also the traction to improve even more your your performance okay so before communicating you need to know okay but what are we going to talk about right so you need to be very clear the problem of my methodology is you have way too many priorities right you have so many things to do you cannot just show off this uh checklist and say to your board of director hey guys this is what we're going to do this is way too much and you need to focus on only few specific action plan and I can tell you I didn't apply all this action plan in in in one time to get my results so to keep in mind we reduce the inventory by 19% but it's not by implementing all of this we didn't Implement RFID blockchain or any like any any kind of innovation we really focus on what we say three short oops sorry three short-term action first then two medium-term and one long-term action why you need to have shortterm because you want to have fast result to get the confidence of whatever you're a demand planner you just St in the company or you are the director you need to show that okay you are the person who will deliver results that's why I like I like to have three short time then I like to have two medium terms because some you can have short time games but you also want to improve like in a medium term I'm going to talk for example about forecast etc etc and then it's good always to have a long-term action it could be a project for example implementing blockchain or automating your replenishment uh something that you know is going to take six even one two or three years but it's always good to have a long-term perspective to show that okay you you know how to fire fight and improve the the results but you also know how to lead a projects and make bring your sulation to the next level for to make it more sustainable and have long lasting results okay so I like this structure you you don't have to follow exactly but I like to I think the classic mistake to be would be to forget about shortterm and only think about like an expert okay we need to move to the blockchain and machine learning and there is you don't deliver result for the next two years or the opposite you are always F fighting to improve the micro like the micro and your more simple product but you always forget you're not building the right foundation to go to the next level okay so really keep this in mind that's why I really wanted to help you and that for me this um this um this gain like this column will really help you also to classify and that's that's gold for me if I had this list at the beginning I would save so much time so now the question is okay Ed what are the the top priorities so the the top priorities are already in my in the presentation we're going to build together but how do you know do you know by analyzing your your products and I can tell you already by checking the dashboard we're going to open this fully so by checking the dashboard you know what is important by checking the numbers versus your your your goals right why what I can see here I can see that for example we have a big problem with forecast because we are over forecasting I was saying that before the forecast like yeah today is 8% and the sum of my forecast is 15 so we absolutely need to reduce our review of forecast it's a m midterm G gain because it takes time sometimes to review the forecast regarding inventory we have way too much inventory where our stock is is grow is growing by 18% when you have a Target by only growing by 5% driven by forecast but not only and we have a huge stock Gap that we need to reduce so that would be definitely my number on priorities to reduce uh my inventory regarding my my service because it's always about inventory service U definitely uh it's not too bad we we are very close to the Target but we have a big problem with aod so I'm going to focus only on the my aod for this one and then when we check the stock we have a lot of discontinued stock so if you want to reduce the inventory I will for sure Focus first to clean my Obsolete and obsolete stock and then regarding the suppli report we're going to go back to this with all theq so if you don't know just follow my checklist so you can just scroll down like this if you feel like if you remember if you don't remember okay okay I did this I did this I did this you can just go back to your base and you remember on the left here on the right sorry not the left the the right on the the left on the right you can do like this if it's not visible uh you you can just like we say before that the priority is really to focus on inventory reduction so we can go from largest to smallest you click like this it's already done and then you can just say okay but where are my action and you can just count you can do a pivot Tel if you want you have multiple colum but what do we see we see okay for the most important one we need promotion review Safety stock the second one review Safety stock review mq the third one reduce forecast review mq the the the fourth one uh review Safety stock review Safety stock promotion consel orders disable forecast increase Safety stock for this one only review Safety stock mq promotions canel orders promotions review Safety stock promotions reduce forecast canel or postpone ORD so you see we always repeat the same action so say okay this is my keep in mind this is my most important level right and for all of them I have like three or four priorities that always come back promotion review Safety stock review forus canel orders okay so that that would be definitely my priority shortterm midterm in like the the midterm will be definitely a review mq because it takes time to review mq with your suppliers and review forecast as well and for my short time it will be promotion for obsolute stock it will be to review my safety stock as I can do it fast I already have the the recommendation and it will be probably to clean my obsolete stock as well uh with the the promotion and the last one will be review promotion canel orders we have way too many orders that we don't need uh because we have too much stock too much inventory because we don't need it because they discontinued inventory so we have the three shortterm I'm going to go back to the presentation to show you exactly we have the two midterm forecast mq and also make sure that the suppliers deliver on time and the longterm will be okay let's pick one project if we go back to this it will be more regarding probably the the longterm okay do we want to automate our inventory management to leave Excel to use RFID blockchain or this kind of projects it could be another one but I will definitely Focus first on automating your inventory management it could be medium-term or long term but let's say in this one we say okay we're going to start with Excel but then we're going to switch to probably a system Erp to do it completely automatic that will be a long-term project okay so that's that's uh that's it for my first introduction to be very clear okay what do you need to do of course you could have much more much more action you don't have but you don't have to show everything and if you communicate on everything you're going to lose focus and you're going to lose uh like intensity on what will be your your main your main focus so now in the in my next uh videos I'm going to explain to you how to make this effective presentation or to present it all the mistakes to avoid and it's going to be very exciting I can tell you this is a lot of value I never had anyone around me explaining me okay what I'm supposed to do as a supply share manager SN manager and this is goal for you so stay with me
in this episode we're going to talk about how to have an effective communication why is it important to have an effective communication especially if you have a big company you have a lot of noise between Department marketing wants to do plus 50% production wants something stable sales they only push because they want to sell they don't care about inventory level and they don't understand why you don't have 100% of inventory Finance they don't have the budget maybe you work in finance and because I know many people from Finance join my discourse but you have to be very careful with the cash flow and the budget and the Big Bus the CEO he has to report to the sholders so you always have to show that we are ambitious and when you work like for example in theop or into I was snop manager for for a few years it's quite a challenge to be in between so okay but what I'm supposed to do and I can tell you when I when I became like snop manager for example in Australia it was the first time I was officially SN manager even if everyone is working part of the snop uh it was a big challenge for me and I think like I became really really fast um supply chain director because I was really leading uh the snop meeting in a very efficient way and people can could really see my leadership and the fact that I was really focused into actions and results without blah blah without so I'm going to I'm going to share with you how do I structure my presentation whatever it was in my company when I was manager director or when uh I'm a consultant for me this is the same way and I'm going to give you the the what you have to really be careful if you want to have an effective presentation the first one you need to be efficient because you don't have time like I remember at one point I was I was preparing my presentation for three four five days with all my team and we were stopping everything so you need to have a process to make it as efficient as possible I'm going to show you my tricks I'm using a lot of my Excel and I'm not creating any animation I keep it very simple with excellent template keep in mind less than maybe not the first time but one your presentation your is ready less than 2 hours then you need to share this presentation 48 hours before the meeting if you have a steing committee with different people whatever you're a demon planner or you're an SNP manager it's very important that people know your presentation they don't discover because then it will be much faster if they have question important questions before they will send it to you and most of the company they just people just show show up they're late they don't even apologize and they just discover okay what's going on I didn't know we had a 10 gap between this and this so it's very important to share before then you need to have clear goals okay what what is the goal of this presentation where is the goal of this committee what are we focusing right now most of the company they're not very clear with the goals or they are not really clear like I'm going to go back to Smart goal after then the the the presentation has to be simple and straight to the point this is not uh with this this presentation meeting is not to talk about uh what happen during the weekend or blah blah blah you can do it before if people arrive before but not during this is not also a meeting a followup meeting for other subjects you need to be really clear and really have the leaders you this is what we're going to talk about today if you want to talk more you can stay in the room or in the zoom call or whatever but you need to really control the time and keep it simple and straight to the point short I like to do my presentation in less than 45 minutes I feel like one hour is too long we can keep like 15 minutes at the end for questions but most of the time I keep it very very simple and people people love it because they don't feel they losing that time and why because I'm well prepared everyone knows the presentation before and I I give example and also get all the guidelines and the Action Plan before we don't have to decide for the action plan I already decide and I share everything with everyone all right you need to start on time as well if you get to not start on time waiting for someone people will will get used to it they won't respect your leadership and they will be even worse it's like a snowball so start on time and once someone arrive late don't don't come back to the presentation if it happen more than once what I'm doing is I I don't blame people in front of everyone I don't like to blame people whatever is the person I wait until the end and then I I go to speak to the person he need to have the courage to do he say look this is not the first time you arrive late this is for me a very important meeting because we have a very ambitious gr for this year so if you feel you you cannot commit I will I will ask to someone else to I will ask you to to bring someone else to to bring someone else from your team or maybe your your boss uh because this is very important and I need someone who can really commit and arrive on time let me know if you need maybe we need to re rearrange the time of the meeting but next time I really continue so something positive but you need to be very FM okay you need to finish on time I like to finish earlier people love is like you know it's like at school I remember at school when you have like a two hours class and you finish 30 minutes earlier and you can go playing soccer or having a baguette or croissant you know like you save time when your teacher is six you have the same feelings and people will really respect you if you start finish on time okay next you need to have all the key what we call stakeholders the stakeholders are the key person to make uh this targets and action plan happening so if you need you need production you need to have some from production if you are complaining about Market it's because you need someone from marketing who really commit I always recommend if you're an snop leader or manager to have if possible the CEO in this room but don't leave the co take the leadership you are the leader of this presentation but I like to have everyone and the CEO as well because you will see okay uh this is a well drive pres meeting and it will also help you to push for example when marketing is not really taking care of the the inventory level or when you need more budget from Finance etc etc so make sure you identify all the key stakeholders and make it like a really important event for all the company also if you feel you have some like what we call challenging stakeholders like you say oh marketing we're always fighting and you feel like you're going to fight with them during the presentation and that's another secret I really I can really insist you should do is like if you feel you have a problem for example with marketing I had a problem with the sales director at one point what I was doing is had always a pre catchup before the the the presentation with only the sales director and I was presenting the presentation only to him so I was taking this 30 minutes you know the cof said look I know this is important for you and I would like to have your feedback before the official one with the CEO and you know instead of fighting in front of each other during the presentation he was on my side because oh edor is really taking care of my into account my point of view he even asked me for my feedback before so during this the presentation if you have these people do do this uh like work before and you will be lifechanging in the collaboration and the energy you will have during this presentation that was a big big win for me and I was also one of the reason most of the people everyone was really respecting me because I was it was it was not politics for me was really to take care into account the the most critical point of view and challenges by Department then you need to have an action plan you need to be very very clear at the you need to have goals at the beginning at the end okay who is doing what what who when and what are the kpis you need to be very clear because the next presentation you're going to use okay that was a previous action plan this is what happened okay so you need to be very very clear with that what everything I saying is very basic but no one is doing it I can tell you no one is just it's just freestyle no no one prepare not no one most of the time or it's super boring like like two or three hours only one person is speaking and it's boring or it's not visible so keep it like to really follow this plus you need also to send a de brief summary by email just after the presentation usually I even prepared email before because I already know everything and I send the the action plan the so what you're going to do you're going to send the the presentation but most of the people they won't have time to open the presentation so you send the presentation a memo with like the bullet points okay what are the three main short temp parities to midterm and longterm maybe one or two challenges and the action plan with who is respons ible for what with the date okay so if you do that plus action plan followup once a week you make sure you are not responsible for everything but is good to have a followup you will be a machine you will be a machine and I can tell you everyone will respect you and if you work for a company that will be a like that will be a a game changer for your promotion in the company and if you're a consultant they will love you because you are really straight to the point and you don't need to do like 300 slides for that okay so that's that is for the effective presentation now we're going to do it for first of all I'm going to give you a tricks with PowerPoint and then I'm going to we're going to build it together in like 10 or 15 minutes only
okay so now let's talk about not Excel but PowerPoint this is the template we're going to build you know it's very clear result blah blah blah straight to the point so in this first video I'm going to give you a few tricks to improve uh your efficiency with PowerPoint to make it as efficient as possible starting with the design so we're going to start from scratch this is my PowerPoint first of all you know you have these two slide so you can hide the slide up hide so it won't be part when you play the PowerPoint it didn't work yes you see when you go up it it doesn't appear any more so you can I slide like this you could also create uh sections if you want to have different sections like intro like this then you could have like a results if you have too many I don't have too many so I won't use it but it's it's useful if you have a lot of slides you know so I'm going to remove this one remove T section that's something you can use the first thing but before that I will go back from the start let's create a new one okay blank presentation so what about the design most of the time you already have a template from your company so keep it simple use the template from your company don't waste your time if you don't have the template from your company you can go I'm using the latest PowerPoint version maybe you have a different but they all have the same almost the same you can also use Google slide if you want it's a bit different I prefer PowerPoint but whatever uh you go to the design then you have different Des design wow wow wow wow to be honest I don't like let's create a new one I don't like when it's too fancy when it's I think that was to you know the 90s uh early 2000 in early 2000 everyone wanted to do fancy presentation blah blah blah you know like with these kind of colors but at the end I feel like the more it's fancy the more it doesn't look serious so you don't want to look too serious but you don't want to look too fancy because okay this guy spent two two days just on the the design he's not doing is a supply change job or something like that so you can pick one let's pick this one and what I did for this one is okay I like this green but what you can do you can also change the color right so I like to keep it minimalist like this I'm going to move I think that was this one boom okay then a classic mistake is to change one by one the slide you say okay I don't like this so I'm going to do like this I'm going to change the color of this and I want the logo let's have a logo uh logo whatever logo you know this this amazing company called ABC Supply Chain let's do this you know like like for example the logo and then I'm going to create a new one and I say oh I need to copy and paste the logo again you know like it's a completely waste of time right so what you need to do I don't know if you know that already you need to play with this what we call the slide Master what is the slide master you go to view slide master and you're going to change the design of all the slides automatically for example the log you're going to you're going to insert the logo for every single slide so you go to view slide master and you see in this one you have all the templates right so you can change all the templates and then they're going to be ready directly in your one so you will change the master template for all of them you can also change the one for the title etc etc so what what is this different when you go to a new let's create a new one you can see in the layout you're going to send this is the title the section and you can change all of them once and you don't have to repeat okay you so you spend this you know 20 minutes to make it clean once and then that's it okay so I always recommend to do that so let's go to let's change the slide Master the slide Master sorry we go to view slide master and we're going to add for example the logo so let's control V the logo let's put ABC Supply Chain pretty cool and then when you close it no you see I don't need the the Slime this anymore and you see I can I cannot even copy it say oh I can change my presentation yes because that this is a slime Master right so you see it's automatically in so it's super useful I'm not going you can check on YouTube you have a lot of tutorials but you don't need much so I'm going to show you the most important then I don't like this I like to to keep like smaller I like to change the size of this bullet Point as well because I feel it's too small so let's go back to this SL master so I'm going to remove this one like this maybe a bit bigger T I'm going to remove this one here I'm going to change this one bullet numbering maybe just this one up I did so many PowerPoint in my life I I started my business school so I did engineering school and business school and the only thing I remember from my business school is to how to create super super fast presentation that was a a very useful skill thank you for that but too much um too much party in business school not working a lot uh and for this one I'm going to change to I was doing the business and uh engineering the same time so I wasn't parting too much but the one who were only doing business it was was a lot of parties too much not too much but anyway I was refocusing on my my okay can change the size Okay cool so now we have this we have this and I think we are good maybe for the T we can change the title if you want to say Okay I want to do like this I want to do like this and I think we're pretty good so we are like this we can go back to slim Master we can close it beautiful we have this when we create a new slide now we have this on this T okay so we have this slime Master when you feel it's ready you can uh also so you can change the colors before I always Shing that before in the design if you want to have different colors I've done that before the font as well if you don't like the font the effect and the background style but but I like to keep it minimal I prefer blank why blank because I feel this is more efficient if you have pictures to show it like it's easier to copy and paste something like that the the next oh you can also change the design be behind that if you go back to slime Master you say no this is to be you can also move it uh you could do like something like that you don't see this one the part whatever up I know you can see that okay so this is a mess but you you do what you want to do okay you can also insert a page number I don't remember what are the page number yeah other on Footers you could say Okay I want to have the slide number footer something like that and you will have this well I don't like this much but I don't like slide numbers as well but you can do it and when it's ready what you can do as well you can fail not file save as template and you can reuse this template so you go to brow and you go to PowerPoint template and you save it as presentation uh test like this I have the one for ABC and when you create a new one now you can create from oh I don't see it it's funny new yeah and you can do presentation test and automatically boom it will create your new presentation with all your slide okay so that was that that that was it for the the tricks for PowerPoint in addition to that I gave you some resource if you want to have for example free pictures I'm not using this that much but um much less than before like if you want for example a warehouse make sure it's free so you can oh I like this one this doesn't look like a warehouse for example yeah you want this one so you want to add a presentation like this in your staring committee you say wow there is there is a warehouse like this so you have this kind of make sure it's free copyright free otherwise you can have problems especially if you post this presentation online uh you have this one as well this is free pictures and you also have for icons if you like icons for example I don't no Warehouse I'm passionate with Warehouse no okay box yeah you have box like this you can copy and you have a box beautifully I like to use the icon you know my pedagogy I'm using a lot of Icon but also keep in mind oops that you can also have this um resource directly know if you go to insert you have icon directly with PowerPoint which is quite useful if you for example Warehouse oh I have a warehouse cool amazing and you can also change the color of the warehouse to Green to Red so that's something useful if you want to explain something always use pictures and icon this is uh very useful this is at the end of the PowerPoint that you can download and I feel like this is the the resource you need for that okay so now we're going to build this presentation was it for the the presentation keep it simple create a template and then use this template with your own company I put the the logo of this company you because it it should be your logo uh and try also to match the the color of your logo and the color of the presentation it looks more professional so that's it now we're going to build the Pres the presentation
okay so now let's make this presentation I'm going to quickly show you all the slides and then I we'll go back to it step by step it's important to start with okay what is the title of this presentation it could be SM steering committee it could be the SNM meeting it could be like if you're a project manager consultant you will be like find a cool name and also don't forget the date and who is responsible for it and change the logo go to the slide master and change the logo then we have the the agenda what we're going to do the goals then the results oop the current results with the avability the sales growth the inventory turn which is not good we're going to I just I always like to give example with top 10 obsolete I I show some ABC analysis and but I try to keep it simple I'm going to go back to this then the three shortterm priorities we're going to focus on inventory reduction I was talking about that before first of all obsolete stock reduction then urgent orders order consolations I should put an S here then the Safety stock review then we have the two medor tempori suppliers delay the and one be suppliers mq reduction because they're way too high the focus review with few example I always like to give one specific example it's like kind of education and then one longterm priority we're going to automate the inventory management and looking for maybe a new software and the action plan at the end okay what are the actions who which department who is responsible and when do we have to do it okay that's it and at the end okay guys we can do it so you see it's pretty it's pretty fast um I won't I won't spend like I will spend maybe 40 30 minutes to present this with all the questions and that's and then we have a clear direction of what we're supposed to do so now the question is are you going to make it as efficient as possible for for the goals I'm going to use a lot the Excel that we we have just before so if you have an Excel automatic then it it will takes you maybe 30 40 minutes to to make this presentation not the first time because you're not used to it but the more you will do it the more you will be efficient and people will really respect you because it's clear minimalist and straight to the point with no blah blah so for the goals you need just to go back year goals we have this one so if you go back to your goals we go to the projection and we do have or from the dashboard as well if you want to see okay what is the target you have 10% for the stock gross we have 5% and keep in mind we do we have more information regarding the sales we do have 10% here and for the stock our Target is 5% and we have the keep in mind we have the year to date here total and year to date in these two formulas I could change this yeah oh sorry and for my stock we can see that my stock is the projection of my stock is to grow by 20% and the average stock is 65 million the projection okay so we can use these numbers we have the Gap and we also have the stock Target my stock Target is 37 and the current one is 151 so we we go back to my presentation my goal is 135 it's incorrect it's 177 thanks for checking and my target is 57 Millions great I'm going to close this to because it's doesn't help me right always have a clean desktop when you when you work then uh I go back to this one my warehouse have ability so we're going to only talk about the warehouse not the multi all the sites we have you could also talk about it but I want to keep it simple for this one the dashboard say we want to have 92% of Target I think yeah 92% and I want to have 95% for my a codes so if I go back to this 92% you could also add here a code 95% if you want to add something like this and my say plus 10% and we have only plus seven so then you you put the results sales Warehouse avability grade that's the main goal and it's important to really focus on that this is the most important then we do have the results so for this I just add an icon if you just go like this icon I was explaining that before Warehouse you can also use my my schammer like this up CH and you change the color like this okay you have to keep it with play with colors don't make people uh like having like to to understand okay but what is the main takeaway for every slide you need to clear okay when it's red it's bad when it's orange it's it's more or less okay when it's green it's good don't don't make them interpret every single slide okay for this one avability it's orang so it's not great why and then you can just say oh we have because we have 92% on Aon and the target was 95% okay so that that's why we can put here I'm going to change this one a cut 92% you could do like this t and maybe you could say okay we ar on track for this one but aode is 92% that's why a codes great so then you have this slide so how to create this sline and keep it very simple you what you can do don't don't do any graph manually you have everything from your dashboard so you go to your dashboard this is your echod you just select contrl C you go back and here you right click and simp you do this one pictures H so you have this one easy we want Brands and Avil avability per site tack tack no you have to you have to pick one by one you can't pick two because it's going to be a you do like this and same for the other one okay and then it's always you can also copy and paste like example from your list for example this is all the out of stock a code and we only have nine codes so you say like nine a codes all of stocks just to focus on this one so what we're going to do you go back to the file don't keep it very simple or you copy in a table in PowerPoint but I'm I really want to keep it simple so I just go to a I just take the one with 0% and then the only thing you have to be careful you don't want to show everything so you do like this you hide and you do like this boom you go back to this right click pictures okay that's it you do like this and if you want to have some effect you do like this PL you do picture format and you can do something like this or like this wow that's cool I like to have this effect it's a bit more professional okay so I did like this and it's always important for every single slide what is the takeaway avability the focus is this one be color okay this one red how you how do you do that insert shape like this I'm going fast but it's a no feeli and not line like this check he VOA well to be hon this is not 90% for SEC SEC this is this is for me too high that's why we also have too much inventory Okay so we've done that congratulation then we have this one this one same you go back to the dashboard so you can then what you can do you can unhide so you go back you right click unhide then you don't have the problem anymore and we're going to do the same for the dashboard I'm not I'm not going to do everything no for that t right click boom you can increase double you can double click and then it will appear automatically and boom you know you have this effect wow this is cool okay so we have this then we say okay say gross plus% Focus PR 15 and then iust this warning and this warning is I like to add warning as well icon you go to Icon warning you don't have much in PowerPoint but the they're very useful you do like this and then you can change to yellow and you can change it on show because most of the time they don't have time especially if you if you share the presentation before it's important you have more information say okay we have too much or forecast are way too high okay then you do the same for inventory projection this time okay inventory turn year to date 155 the forecast for the year is 151 this is way too high you can see like with the graph okay be careful the budget is way below and then we have the top 10 Stock I just did the same copy and paste top 10 stock obsolute stock I just want to my top 10 here oh yeah you could do like this boom and you could remove active and discontinued up okay uh we you you copy and paste this this is from the pivot tab this one pivot base just to show the value it's always good to show the value right this one so this one is a bit a bit more technical what I did is like you can use my template if you want but you insert a tab like this and then you change the color of the tab like this and then I wanted to show like the percentage of item per classification uh don't show that if they never they never heard about ABC XY Z so maybe you can show my YouTube video as an introduction to understand okay what is the difference but like don't show this if they never what is XYZ you need you need to be part of the of the maturity and the educational process but I like to show the percentage of item say okay we have a lot of product low sales and very uncertain then the we sity to show like this one are too low I could change the colors of this one oh no shape format oh no shape out line this and this one for me are too high to be honest and also this one is too high as well like you have for active item we have 365 days so how to do that you go back to this tab so if you want to know for example the percentage of item you just copy and paste from this one you paste and then you need to go to you move like this no um like this in the middle and then you need to change the color so I won't change all of this CU it's too long no um yeah like this okay so you could be green like this etc etc okay so you do like this I did the same for this one this one you can add all of this and I want to show okay okay I need to focus on this where severity for a code A and B even this one and for the Stockton I really need to reduce the inventory of this one because I way to away for my active item okay cool then we have the three shortterm priorities we were talking about before what I did is I I really want you to focus on the my main values so I want back to my I'm not going to do all of this because it doesn't you don't need to do all of this you now you get it so you just filter like largest to smallest this time we're going to go to discontinued code and I want just want to show the picture you can hide everything you don't need and you're going to just copy and paste just a list and I always like to show the biggest one because then the sales director can say oh I know items 2 621 I have this one in mind for a while blah blah blah so you need to show numbers don't show too much this is almost too much uh because I like to keep it very minimalist but it's still visible from the top the most important one and you can it's really important that you give always the main takeaway okay obsolute stock reduction we have 16 obsolute item that with more than 50,000 USD that represent 4.4 million USD dollars and that's 73% of the total so if we fix this 161 we're going to reduce our UPS stock by 73% and we're going to save 4.4 million so that's the main takeaway okay so keep it very simple then the second one urgent order cancellation say okay this is all the others we need to canel so or you do not you know that you do it from your analysis so you can go back to my previous module or you can also use this label label cancel or postpone orders you select this one the problem is sometimes they're also in the colum two or three so that's why you have to be careful with that or you can repeat the process I was do doing and then you go back to my orders and you go back to largest to smallest and you can show okay which one are the biggest one we have to cancel okay we have active we have discontinued etc etc and you copy and paste we do have this and it's always good to say okay 6.7 million USD films to cancel and you can see this from lag 6.7 this is a subtotal so we can only see that 2.2 well you you need to improve the filters but this is more or less what you can save so this and the goal will be action you always need to have an action cancel at least 30% of it because it's not possible able to consel all the ERS okay your target is to consel 30% of it and then you need to have a responsible for it and we're going to talk it you can put it here I think it's even better to have one responsible next to the action you could say Okay procurement team help us to canel everything then the third one Safety stock two high two high manual Safety stock 148 items total impact 11.5 million USD so you say oh what is that so this time we go back to we're going to take only the active one because the other one we should just disabil it and the Safety stock we have a safety stock variation we're going to go to um smallest because it's negative okay and the total impact is 11 million or something like that yeah 11.5 million and you're going to show the biggest variation first what is the manual current Safety stock is the the recommending one and what is the Devolution you copy and paste action review the top 50 active codes 6.6 million USD so if you take the top 50 because you don't want to do everything I know wait you have too many too many too many oops what's happening with my Excel okay you select the top 50 count 50 and the total is 6.6 million boom okay I like to do top 50 top 20 top 100 but keep it very simple just focus always on the biggest important value then you have the two midterm priorities supplyers delay 10 supp with more than seven days average delay 26 of the total order value for that we go to FM orders so the more your Excel is automatic the easier is it so then you have the time you can change the colors if you want and say okay we have one we have no we have 12 12 suppliers always good to check and the total value is 40 millions and the total from the total of 153 so that's something like 26 yeah 40 divis by 153 26 so you can copy and paste this one boom 26 and the action will be SLA service level agreement and average lead time review Focus China in India this is the top two you have three from China One from India and but it's India it's French speaking and you need to focus on the biggest one first biggest delay and biggest value okay amazing then you have the Super Players M first be so I'm cheating because like you have two you have three priorities for M but I feel are very important so I'm I put it one B because it's the same process you're going to talk to the suppliers uh you have two two with like this and this one I forgot also orders okay I go back to my my to my midterm so the supply mq two High mq s 73 items potential over stock 12 million USD which is a lot and action reduce mq India and Spain 3 first so you can see quickly like India number one is 2.4 million Overstock then we do have Spain with 1.5 million so we're going to focus on this one first and we need the procurement team to to help us and then we have example like this maybe too much information but at least people can see few example between what is theq and what is the the variation of the the mq versus the for example e with the percentage okay so from that this is the colon you will have probably different goals and and priorities but I'd like to show you the full steps so mq are something like no here we are so we have all this information and we have the Overstock just Dr on sorts largest to smallest cool then I go back to forecast review so for the forecast review we do have 351 active items with plus 50 plus 50% forecast the next four weeks so what do I do for that we go back to active items I feel it's good to filter by biggest volume first say and forecast or you could only do forecast if you want great and then you go to greater than 0.5 and you have all your item you need to review first and I will only Select A and B code okay so we do have 15 a code and we do have 101 B code that's it boom so it's very clear 15 a cutes and 100 B 101 B cods very simple and then you can give one example oh hey guys let's check item number blah blah blah it's always good to give one good example say okay this is a good example I just removed this curve because I feel it's easier to read the graph that's it and you can say okay that will be one example we have to review oh no this is not one example I we go to item three you copy and paste this one and you can see okay you see that the forast is so I'm going to remove this one because it's easier to read say okay this is the the forast for 2004 this year and this that was the new forecast we recommend and you can see that the varation we are divided by two by the end of this year so that's a good example it's a good way to explain okay what you're doing and this the process you're going to do uh you can say okay last year the the S were much lower etc etc so we have one example and then the longterm priority it's more about the project so project management you can talk about what is the impact today over stock Pro distribution not productive and you could say okay what are the next step to implement this project the first step will be to calculate the return on investment this month with someone with a consultant framing the project defining defining the scope and needs test testing identifying you have to pick if you use or not integration blah blah blah so you need it's just a followup so for the project you could also put a planning I think I feel it's even better if you have a planning okay so you have these priorities and at the end you have the action plan and for the action plan I did a table so you insert a table and you have to be very clear who is responsible for for from what and everyone in the room has to say yes I will do it and and you already agree with that so to prepare that I'm going to there is one missing for 15 sorry j you have a lot of work so you actions has to be very clear and easy to measure and track Department I feel it's important to to see that it's not only I'm ping the department just to show that this is not only about sulation right we have demand planning procurement Finance sales production we have a consultant let's say like edir is responsible to the uh to create to calculate the return on in investment etc etc but it's very important that you have a very clear responsible and I usually I confirm the Action Plan before the presentation then people are not surprised oh but I don't have time for this I I do I disagree with that okay so you have this action plan everything is clear and then at the end you say no we can do it I'm very proud of you everyone is clapping his hands and we are all together and at the end you send this presentation with a memo with the plan I just sent a screenshot of this in my email say okay guys this is the action plan thank you so much for coming today and that's how I process to create an an efficient presentation I can tell you I had very good uh traction and feedback from this so follow my uh the ID and the structure and I can tell you you can uh make big impression where whatever you are starting your career or you're already an exper consultant you see it's very short you don't have much blah blah you could also add anex at the end if you want to add more information but you don't you don't you don't think you need to show everything I do not recommend to open an Excel during this kind of presentation because it's too much details and people will get lost and they will start asking too much questions so it's very important that you always Point what you want to show okay don't let them analyze everything maybe for this screen sometimes a bit too much information because they're going to start checking every colon so really try to really focus on what they have to see with this kind of effects like this okay that's it now you have to do it Implement your Excel improve your performance don't forget to communicate
all right so we're getting closer to the end I'm very proud of you so we did an effective presentation congratulation you you did the presentation you make an effective energetic also the energy is very important you share the main priorities and action plan at the end I know the last step is to empower your team so it's important that this for me this presentation is part of the process but it's also important that you defend and share smart goals for the team so smart for simple measurable accessible and ambitious realistic and timing with like a time frame something like that so make sure it's quite easy in Supply Cham because you do have U you do have a lot of kpis what is probably missing this one is um to have maybe the the goals per Dem if you have different team members you could have the same targets for stock turn avability per demand planners to say okay if you have a demon planning team or if you have people responsible for inventory management you could split so you could create another colon here to have okay demand planner number one or the name of the demand planner I was doing that in my SM metrics course I can show you my dashboard for example demon planning just to show you ta so you have the the team demand planner for example automatic order Focus accuracy you can see that beyon is much better than Zan and same for same for automatic order you could also I could also create one okay what's happening with Zan and it will display all my results yeah I need to refresh this one first yeah it will display all my result for one specific person all right so Define and share this SM smart girl per team member I was talking about it then share your goals with all department and I think I feel the Pres the presentation I was talking before is the opportunity to share all these goals so keep in mind this effective presentation you could do it at the global level you could also do it per brand or per Department if you feel that this is important and you have different responsible for that you could also have a specific presentation maybe monthly for your team if you have a big team like one want had more than 50 100 people in my team I had a specific one just for my team and it's important to always celebrate victories not only the challenges don't forget that I think I should put it in my in my checklist to celebrate and add don't forget to celebrate all the victories review and Shadow result weekly monthly and annually so that's why you have this kind of tool the IDE is really at least for me to refresh once a week to review the the service the costs always go back to the the checklist with the the a code B Cod uh first the top 10 inventory top 10 obsolete stock um what is my uh Target versus my base Target in terms of inventory etc etc and the more you will be consistent the less you will have surprise to say oh I forgot to to this specific item etc etc another point is introduce this checklist into your weekly and monthly team routine uh I feel like you don't need something as complex I feel like this is this checklist is more for a project manager a manager or a consultant but I will I will do something maybe shorter and I will keep it very simple okay what do we have to check every week every month and um every for example every year every year and I can tell you the shortterm one have to be checked every week every week you need to check if you have to cancel orders reduce cancellation you always Focus From The Top Value First and a and b code but all the short term for me should be checked once a week as a part of the um SNP process and Demon planning process I'm going to talk more I plan to create an SN course and a forecasting course but I think that's good enough for for this one we had a lot of information so introduce this checklist keep it as easy because you have a lot of movement in the team if someone is leaving the more you will be you will have that's about the next step the more you will document this process the more it will be easier if you have change if you have new people coming and I can tell you most of the team they don't have any documentation or checklist and once someone is leaving we just lose like two years result and we go we go back from scratch to zero so be very careful with it this is probably the most boring part but this is one of the most important one and you need to train and appoint multiple people to lead this process to lead all this checklist to lead all this review if this person is leaving or if you you are leaving the company uh performance will drop again and you don't want that so you always need to have a plan B and also maybe like I was always training in team someone who could take my position in case of I want to leave I want to take a sabatical leave again or I want to create my own business right so it's you don't want to F goody to leave or you don't want to feel like oh I cannot leave because I'm the only one to know so many people oh but they could take your job but I was always very confident that anyone can take my job I have because I'm I was always in the process of learning I was never really afraid or in competition with someone because I was always learning and improving my skills so always try and appoint multiple people for that and I will be the end almost the end I'm going to I'm going to tell you how to go to the next level for my conclusion but I'm very proud of you because we've done all this checklist together we're going to finish just with this one but that was a big list and I can tell you once again you don't need to do all of this to have amazing results with this specific company uh we we reduced by 19% the inventory and they're still reducing right now with a much better service thanks to this very simple action plan so it's not that much work if you have the structure and the methodology and also you don't forget to communicate and train and you will have amazing results as well and I can't wait to you to share with me all your results and the feedback from your team your your clients and your your your directors let me know as well if you have a promotions okay so we're going to finish very soon but I'm already very proud of you
congratulation you made it I'm very proud of you and in this last episode I'm going to tell you how to go further if you want to go even deeper in the expert level in the sulation world so what is important is you need to keep measuring your performance analyzing learning and improving this is you will never if you think like you you know everything today this is a mistake I all I'm always learning and improving even while while I was creating this methodology I was correcting while I was doing it with you sometimes oh I could improve this I could do that so never stop learning with me but of course with other people around you could be in the company could be from like whatever is the sour when you feel like this person can really inspire you or improve your your performance spend time with this person even if you have to pay for it right I've been doing that for a while at the end we move from Foundation to professional to expert in the next modules I'm going to share with you the bonus we have many bonuses that we're going to share to even to go even deeper this is not mandatory to get the certificate so you can validate if you don't want to see them I really recommend you to check all of them but if you don't you don't have the time and you want the certificate you just approve them you don't have to watch or do any specific quizzes uh for that okay but I'm very I'm super excited once again there were we were talking about Inventory management or to improve the service and the the the profitability of your company but ABC Supply Chain is not only about inventory management this is a big part but not only and if you want to go to the foundation professional expert then eventually the the leader level as a super expert manager or entrepreneur and my goal is really with ABC SP to improve your performance your skills your attractiveness on the market to to make sure that you can choose your projects your boss your clients if you sell your services to get basically the best salary as possible if money is important for you the freedom I feel for me freedom is more important than money so I will refuse many Consulting projects for example because I feel like my freedom is more important and I do enjoy more education than Consulting that's my my personal experience and I love to have fun and I love to share because sharing is super funny for for for me okay so if you want to become even more an expert if you don't already have this program I I do have another program to become an expert with Excel so we we did use a lot of excel but in this one we're going to go much deeper into automation cleaning optimizing uh I'm creating a new version right now so you can join my waiting list below this video then we do have SM metric this is one of my bigest methods as well if you want to know more about the whole supply chain to track the whole performance and to really create amazing dashboard that we really impress your direction and your clients for example uh this is the course on there this one is very complementary with inventory management expert on the on the global level so it's perfect if you for example if you're earing your care if you really want to have a global picture of it or if you want to create a very efficient dashboard not only for inventory management but for transport cost Finance uh we have so many procurement retail uh Warehouse e-commerce Etc multi-industry so these two are very complimentary and I'm working on two new projects uh forecasting experts I know you are many to ask me edar when this program is coming my priority was to update this um course first because it was really important for me and it was very I feel this is this is extremely profitable to start with inventory management even if you don't have forecast but my next big baby is going to be forecasting expert and the idea is really to give you as many example as possible to play with the with the data and um give you all the tools to be able to forecast shortterm midterm and longterm whatever you work in supply chain Finance Marketing sales is to give you all the tools and my second baby is to give you also a full methodology to implement an snop that works a simple and efficient snop and that's my two two main babies I'm going to put maybe also waiting list before or you can contact test but if you part if you're member already we're going to keep you posted first because I we're going to do a private uh workshop and the study before we have a lot of things to do okay so this is coming soon I have all the links below don't forget before that to to share celebrate celebrate yes celebrate and share your certificate your with our certificate uh first of all on LinkedIn and this is very

one I really need to to to really feel that it's really helping this is my uh where I get most of my energy this is not yes I'm selling this SC so I'm making money with this SC but the the the pure energy is really coming from oh you really help me I save so much time or I got this job thanks to you this is really that is driving me every every day for that so please we're going to put you another link for that but I can't wait to see your progress once again and this is not this is just the beginning and the best is coming so thank you so much for your trust check the bonus after and I can't wait to see you for another program with ABC Supply Chain
in this bonus I have a new bonus for you because I really like you and I really want you to push to the next level I'm going to talk about power Cy or to automate and clean your data with power Cy with more examples uh because I feel this is something important so this is not a full course autous for query if you want to know more you can check especially SM metrics on my new Excel SM Excel course but I just wanted to give you more tools to make you more efficient and also to to give you this taste to say Okay I want to go further to to to have my life much automatic and I think this is also much more efficient than the macro so keep in mind that that was the the pro version of the Safety stock and I was telling you yeah if you want to update you need to copy and paste the sales the stock etc etc and this is a good way but this is not super efficient you don't want to copy and paste uh data you want to directly refresh and uh go back to analysis and decision making so I'm going to give you more example you can also check I did one in the expert level how to start in a very simple way and this is more example to to show you the more potential about this tool so I recommend you first to download the file and you have all the data we're going to connect and the I we we are not going to copy and paste we're going to connect the professional file to this data this data is not always clean for example in the stock we we don't have price T so we're going to remove colon automatically without doing anything uh you see like for example for past orders we we're going to combine multiple Tab and we're going to remove the first five rows we're going to remove this because the we don't want this we don't want to do manually delete rows we want to review also the format you don't want to have 100 piece you want 100 quantity so you want to remove the PCS to make sure that we can use the numbers uh we can also combine this is the sales year this last year this is last year and current year we want to combine these two into only one file and I I think that's it and yeah we're going to combine all of this into uh the the professional file so that's the scope of what we're going to do the first thing we're going to do right now is we're going to fix this file because this file is broken again yes I'm giving you broken file so when you open this file the the bonus one per query you go to this tab whatever the tab you are going you go to query data queries and connection keep in mind if you're using MacBook you don't have access to Pro query and if you have an Excel version less than 2016 you need to install uh you just Google it you need to install a specific addin into your Excel version but most of you use Microsoft at least 2016 so there is no problem for that and you can see that oh there is a problem wire um warning not wire but warning you need to update that so to fix that you can just double click in any one of them you have a problem why because the source is different why because it was on my laptop you can see this is my laptop and now you have to switch to your on destination in your in your computer or in your sholder if you are in a company so what you're going to do first you're going to fix this file and then I'm going to explain to you how to create this but it's good to know at least how to fix it because even if you don't know how to use it you can at least refresh and update the data without even touching anything so you have all this source to change and what you're going to do you go to data you can do it one by one if you click here for example say minus one you can change manually so let's go back to this one one data expert this time we go to Pro Data and we're looking for sales n this one up I know it's okay there is no problem you see there is no warning anymore so you can do it one by one or you can go to you go to home data source setting and you can select all of them it's faster so this one is good lot mq you go to change source and you can select them lot you can see on the left L is is okay now then change Source pass orders past orders do it with me please good Sayes last year you just have to do it once you have to do it each time you move your file you move the any name like if you change any of this folder before is going to you have to do it again so be careful to do not change the location or the name of the file or the name of your folders above your file so that was this one y stuck and the last one you could do like this you could write code to automatically change all your Source in one time but it's more complex so I won't do it now and you just have to do it once anyway and the last one was Transit perfect so now we have everything you see there is no running yeah this one should be okay what is that just say okay in your okay now we're good so now the file is is fixed I'm very proud of you and if you go to close and load it's going to refresh all the data ch ch ch ch the first time is always longer because is creating the new links and loading the data and I think we are good now we're good so everything is up to date and to do that you can also refresh all there is only one problem with the price I'm going to explain to you why there is a problem with the price it's on purpose because the format of the the item number is not correct but I'm going to do that in another video and we're going to also uh I'm going to explain to you how to upload and clean the data automatically then you don't have to do it anymore
okay so now what we're going to do we're going to just insert one table in a very simple way we are not going to modify anything just to start slowly so what we're going to do we're going to create a you can do with please do it with me slowly but surely what we're going to do first we're going to insert the stock so what is the stock type this is the stock type what we want to do we want to do this contrl C It's Kind kind of like this and we want to do like this okay that's it so what we're going to do for that we don't want to do manual way we're going to use power query and power query will do it automatically we just have to show Once where is the file and what we want to do and if you want to clean anything so where is Pary go to data again and you can click on get data Maybe the layout could be a bit different I have the latest version of excel but just check if you don't find the button maybe just Google it and you will find it according to your Excel version then you have multiple option you can get from file database aure like this is the cloud Power Platform other source like from the web you could even get it from the web if you follow my Excel course I will explain to you how to get exchange rate bitcoin price any kind of information even from your competitors if you want to have the price of your competitors for example that's something really cool okay but let's keep it simple you could be like a database you could also connect with your SQL or even sap if you want it's more complex and you will have a you will need access an IT permission for that so I'm going to keep it simple with from a file most of the time use Excel or text CSV this is the same so we're going to use Excel this time and we're going to get the stock you just select your stock very simple then you need to say okay you have only one sheet the sheet is Stu and then you you never click on load you always click on transform data okay just to double check it and then this is the power query tab we were using it before you have the Home tab you have to transform if you want to move andp calculate so I'm not going to use all of this today but this is just like just to have a quick look on the button it's not that complex you can also add specific columns with specific calculation you can use machine learning to clean we're going to use it later you yes we're going to use machine learning and oops sorry so we go back to home and you the idea is like you see it's like a macro we already like did four steps automatically so okay first we Define The Source if you click on it you can also change the source if you're not agree then navigation you say okay uh this is like a we're going to use the the sheet stock then you say okay so you can see the promotion this one say okay it looks like the first row are the eers we say okay I'm going to promote my eers and then I'm going to change the type because I'm not it Just detect automatically like for example the cost price is like is a is a number and this is text ABC means text and this is a number etc etc okay so you have all of this you can also Define you have to be careful if you are using item code as a text number you can go to back you can go back and say yeah I'm going to replace this and now this is a text number so let's check in the file do we need text yeah we need text format so be careful with that and that's why the price wasn't correct because it was not it was in a number format I'm going to get back to this slowly so we just switch back the item come to text and then what we're going to do we're going to click on close and load okay when you close and load this is what you get okay so you have your table it's like doing a copy copy and paste but this time you don't have to you don't have to copy and paste and if you want to refresh you just go to you can go here you can click refresh oops and the table will be loaded again if you have any change you could also go to data refresh all or refresh all is going to refresh all the query on this one up that's it and if you change something I'm not sure I going to do it now but let's try yeah I cannot do it because it's connected I need to close my file first but if you change this for example value and you go back to my uh book and you refresh you will have 999 that will appear here immediately okay so that's super that's a very efficient way to do it I'm going to show you more tricks so you could also convert directly into a pivot table if I right click here here you click you click to load to and you have multiple option you can clud table pivot table pivot chart or only create connection you could also add this to the data model it will be too complex for today if you want to create specific IPI directly in the power query without using Excel formula but let's say you want to have a pivot table report you do this I was using this for the the expert level and you don't even have to have any uh any table in this file you see there is no table but I can do a pivot table from another file and it's much more efficient and let's say I want to have the stock I have the stock per run that's it it's very uh very simple and you have stock quantity item code you could have this stock stue etc etc but let's say no we want to have the table so let's go back to the table so what we're going to do we go to data query connections right click load two and we go back to a table okay okay so now we have the table so now we going to pause this video and you're going to do the same with Transit where is Transit there is no you just need to upload this one into your new workbook okay so pause this video and do it I want to have the same then stock and then go back to me okay great I'm very proud of you don't don't try to cheat with me you you've done it right we go to data get data from file this time we go transit import she one there is only one you can check let's go to transform data we have everything we want item code we switch back to text because it's a text format yes item name Brun other quantity other number we are good you can change the if you don't like you want decimal percentage you can switch and then you could rename this one because this time we we don't have name we could rename this time Transit Transit and then we can to click load to you can also click here if you want to select multiple options and you say yes I want the table and VOA now we have stuck and Transit automatically in this file and now we're going to do the next in the next episode we're going to start cleaning and inserting removing colors
okay so the next step we're going to insert another tab but this time we want to have the price but we don't have price table we just have the price in the stock table so what we're going to do we're going to import this table again but this time we're going to keep only the cost price and the sales price so let me check my tab want item code item name cost price and sales price okay so let's do that you could copy and paste remove the colon manually but you don't want to do that so let's do it we go back to data get data from file stuck stuck okay we go to transform data and this time we have a stock number two we can rename this one right click price prices and we just want to have we're going to select these two I'm holding shift command remove columns and you see up is removing columns on the right great I don't need this so I remove I don't need this so I remove boom so now we have this item code itm cost price sales price we do have this and now we can just insert the the file so we're going to go to Clos and lo two table you could put it in this worksheet and you click okay that's it so you see it's pretty simple and now automatically my if I go back to my price tab it's going to do all these steps automatically and I just have to refresh and you will get this information clean for me what you could do as well that's another option you could say right click and you could duplicate this one and have the same operation it's even faster if you go this one you don't have to do all the source like this this ta remove col so you is the same step but I'm not doing select the source file blah blah blah there will be another option and then you just click on CL load two and that will be done so that's a very efficient way if you have for example if you are with sap orle sometimes you have 60 columns that you want to use uh you just want to have three item code and something like stock or Price that's a very efficient way to also have an Excel much lighter because you don't have unnecessary columns but you don't want to change the source of the format the format of the source of your file okay so I'm not going to keep this one but that's another way more efficient way to do it and in the next video we're going to start cleaning even more and com combining this these tabs together
in this episode we're going to clean the file the columns automatically we're going to use machine learning for that so what we're going to do in my file you have PC but you want to remove this automatically but before that I forgot to clean something in in the my previous file you remember that my price doesn't work why because my price here is in a number format when my base is in item Cod so I cannot V look up I cannot V look up so we're going to fix this file now it's going to be fixed when you're going to get the file but just to show you how to do it you go to price and you just go to price and you just switch this one to text T you close and load now we are into text format come on yes just text time the first time because I have too many file open as well I guess great and now my file is fixed okay so that was the first one now let's talk about this one so this one I'll go back to my test file this one is price now I want to see my loot insert we go to no not insert data get data from file Excel lot only one sheet transform data great so you have multiple options you want we want to remove this PCS we want to have only the quantity but if you do that I don't think it's going to work we can try let's try you see it doesn't work so if you want you can just go back or to go back you can change type like this up you can remove this one and now what we're going to do we have two ways to do it first of all you can do this way you can just do replace value and you could do say by nothing boom so that's that's another that's the first option now the second option is we can use machine learning to uh to do this automatically we just have to create a new colon so we're going to go to uh add a colon you go to colon from example from selection okay and now it's going to ask you okay what do you want to see I want to see 10,000 okay boom and that's it you already you already know okay this is what you want right and I say okay and this is what you want so it's going to do it automatically I think we do have the all 10,000 yeah that's the mq and then we going to do the I recommend you to do a pause so we're going to rename this one mq rename rename up mq okay and now you're going to pause this video and I'm going to ask you to do the same for L size okay great so you've done it for L size I'm very proud of you we're going to do like this insert colum from example selection and this one I want to have 100 enter sometimes you need to give another example if you have many like different like it's more complex uh you could have like you could have need more more than one example and this is the recommendation when it's okay you just press okay and then you can also remove the columns because you don't want to see this one right if you do like this I'm going to show you rename rename rename rename there we go where is my R here we go lot okay I don't want to have when I do like this file close and load two I don't want to have these two right I just want to have the correct one so we go back to this one and we're going to remove this two I'm going to hold this one and I'm going to remove this colum but you are not losing any data no worries you have just more steps but now you have this one and you can also rename this one like this and this one like this oh lot and that's it you could also invert you say no I want to have my lot before my mq before like this up close and load and you have you have your tab automatically up to date okay so that's it I ra that all my data are the same but it's just one example so never mind so that's it for the load mq in the next one we're going to keep uh cleaning I'm going to show you even more tricks
next tips to use for query we're going to while we we're going to match two different typ so you have sales for one year 20121 and you have sales for 2020 and what you want to do you want to combine these two into only one file and you don't want to copy and paste you don't want to be careful with the first row you want to do this automatically let's say you have last year like we have to in we have this file and this file maybe you have five years six years maybe you have a file per month so I'm going to teach you how to do it automatically it's also important that you it's better to use you know like this time n minus one and N instead of having 2023 24 because each time you're going to change the name of the year you will have to to change the source manually so I I recommend to have standard names like to have n minus one 2 3 4 or for the months instead of having for example the year you could call it M1 M2 M3 for January February March so let's do it first of all we need to import these two separately and then we're going to combine them so let's go back to the test file do it with me yes from file let's get this one first sales transform data so we have we have a file blah you we could switch this one into text because everything is text if you use text for format we have the period we have the say Quantity great so now let's do it another time to you can go from this tab I think as well you go to transform home new source file here we go this time we use this one CH say okay so this is you can rame this one sales n and that one was sales and minus one cool so we have this two in this one you can change or you can do it at the end but let's do it now whatever yes and now let's combine these two so what we going to do for that we're going to go to foren what we call so you have two options you can MH query if you want basically to do a v lookup I'm going to show that if you want to go further with my SMC or Excel course or you can append query so in this time we're going to we have the same column but we want to add more rows into one only one so we're going to create you have two options you can combine these two into for example s or you could create a new one let's create a new one and what we want to do the first table will be this one the second table will be this one two tables okay you could have more tables if you have and you press okay you have sometime I don't know why you have privacy issues sometimes you just click okay in your I don't know what is private but yeah anyway I'm open to everything with you I'm very open okay so I don't share I share all my data and Excel tricks so no that's it we have a full table with all the information you can change the item code format if you want but now we are ready and now we could just go to clo close and load two table let's not do a table this time let's just do a pivot table report okay and what is what where is it that appen I think I took the wrong one so okay we're going to remove this one I wanted to see the appen one this one not this one so I'm going to remove this one oh what we going to do we're going to go to sales one load two I didn't mistake I can just go to only create connection okay and I'm going back to this one and I'm creating so we can remove this one okay and we go to app one let's rename it because it's not clear say total let's create also a folder yes rename let's create a new group as well let's create sales great and we're going to move this one this one this one into cells okay so no it's better and now I click on this one and loot to [Music] comma say total load two and I want to see the table the pivot table report in a new work sheet great so now in this table we do have let's check the period for example we have in the same time 2020 and 2021 amazing we have the Sal quantity and we have everything we want so let's see how looks the table as well that's was we go back to this oop oop lot two and here you have all the table with 2020 and 2021 automatically so you're going to update these two file you're going to update only the the information maybe from this year or last year you just replace the file and then you just press refresh here you can refresh this one or total or you go to data you refresh all and you will have automatic all your data automatically into this file easy but that's a very very powerful tool if you have a lot of data and you don't want to do anything manually you don't want to to have a macro it's much efficient like this
all right so in this episode we're going to get the the information of pass orders from this file pass orders and when you check this file you see that you have we we want to combine Africa Asia Europe and all these ERS into one file the worldwide file from this one it's called world all these P orders we want to have all of them so we want like we did we said we want to combine them but in addition to that there is another problem the data is not clean the table is not clean because we have these first five rows that we want to remove automatically and most of the time when you get information from a system you have a first row like with like the date of refresh or the version of your software and you want to do it and each time you remove this manually or you do micro for that so I'm going to show you how to do that you can try to do it by yourself cuz now you know a bit more about par so pause this video try and then I'm going to show you okay I'm very proud of you at least you try and the most important thing to learn is to try and fail and then you're going to correct uh you you can see during this course I'm doing a lot of mistakes then I correct immediately and because I I fa so much in my life that I'm I'm I feel I'm more productive and efficient today I'm learning faster like this so let's do it together now let's go back to the test file and let's go to get data from file pass orders yes import we go to Africa first all right so we do have this and we want to clean this right so you have multiple option if you want to remove these first four rows right so what we're going to do you you see this button remove rows remove rows and you can say Okay remove top rows and I want to remove the first four or five four okay boom well done so you did that you remove that there is another option remove you can also click to remove blank Ros boom Okay so we've done that automatically so that's part of the process now now the next step is oh you see but I want to have my e just I want colum two I want to have item number right I don't want but I don't want to do this manually so what we're going to do now we're going to do use first row as eer boom now we have item item number perfect we have everything so now what I suggest to you is to do it so you're going to pause this video again you're going to do it for the next three continents and then we're going to do it together okay great I'm very proud of you let's do the other ones let's go back to new source file Excel pass orders I'm going to go really fast now you can speed up the video because you've done it as well congratulation America okay thanks America I'm going to upload all of them and then CLI report pass orders yes hello people from America Africa Asia hello hello everyone thank you for joining my course it's been a long journey this is the the third version I've been doing this one for six years now I'm very happy of the new version and can't wait to have your feedback any uh feedback testimon will be super grateful all right so Asia we have Asia it's very important for me to because it really gets uh energy from your feedback not just by your en enrollment or payment okay I really care of of the quality of my course and I really want you to progress so let me know it's important for me uh pass orders yes Europe you just have to do it once then it's okay so now we have every case clean America we're going to remove Rose black rose and this Asia blank room you see I like to batch like this it's much efficient okay so now we have all this information and you want to combine into one tab so let's create a new group for orders TCH TCH and now we want to create a new one so we go to up and queres as a new three on my table I want to have America Asia and Europe boom Africa America Asia Europe then replace okay great we're going to remove this not remove rename this one worldwide orders great and we're good maybe we can change the item format to text format and that's it we're good to go so we can load table new worksh deck he we have all the information into one tab clean there is no this top five rows because there that file was really messy the transit one where the pass one and you have to do it manually and maybe you're someone doing this in your company and now you just have to to upload the file on your on this folder and refresh and you have this table ready to go you don't even have to upload you could just do the pivot table if necessary but this is something very very powerful and I'm very happy to share that with you
all right so now we have all the the information we need we did the same for prices sales stock Transit we did all this operation into the the file professional we have all this information and the last step is to update this file as frequently as necessary so you have all your data you just have to replace this file please make sure that use the exact same name for sales pass orders you just drop the file replace and like and then you just have to refresh the file please make sure so that you never move the the location and the name of the folders that's why I always recommend to use like standard name like n or n minus one instead of 2023 24 etc etc then you don't have to change the source so you go back to your file whatever you want it's always good to see what is on the right you go data cre connection you don't have to click but it's good to see what is refreshing then you click on refresh all and by doing that all your file you can have your Cofe let's say do it in the on Monday morning while all your maybe colleagues are firefighting with a spreadsheet you just click on refresh all maybe you can ask your it also to drop this file into the the sholder automatically it's possible to do that as well it's a bit more technical but worst scenario you just have to get sales stock and orders from your Erp maybe once a week or every day if you need every day okay and that's it and we're good we're ready to go ready to work analyze and take the right decision to improve your performance and not firefighting and fighting with Excel or your IP to try to understand what's going on so that was really the purpose of this um of this tutorial to give you a taste of what is possible to do in po query if you want to to go much further this is I did a lot of reporting and um Excel and po query tricks with my SM metric course so let's check for example this one I always try to give you the classic way and the PO query way you can see that if I the classic way my file will be 43 Mega and with the POR way I will have only 10 mega so it's much lighter you don't need to well I was uploading for example my sales but I don't necessarily need to have all my my celles I could just do a pivot table like I did in the professional level that you going to see so this is for example an example from um this is a retail dashboard from SM metric course and we are going much more into details we have different queries as well we have multi side with this kind of map that's pretty cool and also I'm using something called the PO pivot so the PO pivot is not the PO query it just giv me the the potential to create new kpi directly into po query so if I go to new measures you can see that we have no we don't have in this one kpi management yeah we have two like this if I go to the demand planning one oops there we go so you will be able if you join if you are not part of this course yet you will have access to all this uh pretty cool dashboard just I'm just teasing all right so that's another one and you have look what you could do as well we can me we can avoid V lookup by doing thata C connections so I'm doing like you I have a lot of I have a lot of data in this one I'm creating a huge base you see I'm merging different queries so it's it's it's a bit more complex because you need a bit more time but at the end you have a massive base with all your information and I don't even do vup I have all my information into this one okay so that's why by merging expanding renam and at the end I have a full database I'm going to close this one that I don't even see but I'm going to pivot table on this database to create all this beautiful dashboard as well okay and just to go back to poo I'm going to create as well specific API just for stock turn margin Focus accuracy so it's a bit more you need more more training for that but if you're interested you can check this course or you can check I'm I'm going to release a new one to become an expert with Excel and uh automate even more with po query po pivot and all the tricks you need like solver the solver Excel the maps the dashboards the the forecasting etc etc so yeah I hope you enjoyed this uh bonus I was just really my my goal was really to push you to the next level try to automate everything and spend the rest of your time analyzing or maybe go back earlier to your to see your friends and family and enjoy life because life is really good so thank you for watching and see you for another bonus
in this bonus we're going to talk about demon explosion or to manage demon explosion this is a survival kit in six steps so this is a bonus you don't have to complete to to get the certificate you can just validate but I do recommend to uh to have a look because this is a good summary of what you can do if you have like like Crisis regarding the demand you don't you don't know what to do and we had a lot of classic mistakes so let's say like we this situation with stoed paper during the the previous co co pandemic so we had unexpected demand to was extremely stable and one day boom everyone starting to buy a toilet paper we had the same with yoga mat uh the the volume were multiplied by four in only few weeks and that was clearly not the the forecast and at the end we have a lot of classic mistakes uh we tend to overreact too late we do a lot of manual stock increase on all the products because it's a panic mod so we're going to raise all we say okay we we we're going to double all the quantities for all the products we increase the safy stock the stock coverage the minimum minimum or mini Maxi manual orders we do unprofitable Express transportation and I've done a lot because we have so much pressure from sales and marketing we start to ship products but we are losing money because it's way too expensive to way too expensive to ship by plane we also have a very poor communication with suppliers very a lot of tensions and aggressivity we also have a lot of tension with the customers and it's kind of like first ordered first serve we have no coste effective or non-profitable shortage management which say like we're going to give the all the products to the first one and we are not focusing on the right ones we have Overstock after the sales the pck sales because we tend to have we order too much and then we have too much stock we have a negative and light communication and we repeat this cycle so I maybe you had this situation before but at the end we go back to the yo-yo effect even if you had like a shortage at the beginning then you have over stock then you have a shortage it's very very difficult to stabilize uh that so the idea of this of this episode is really to give you a checklist of what you have to do in different steps you have six steps that you have to follow so let's say this is your demand your demand is uh like you have an acceleration of your sales here and then it's going to you have a peek and then it's going to fall because most of the time people are buying too much for example toilet paper people were buying way too much toilet paper and then they toilet paper for three or four months and then they start buying toilet paper we the same for St yoga M etc etc and this is your stock situation most of the time you go to like you have out of stock here then you do maybe an F rate so you still have a little sub but not enough and at one point you don't re just enough and boom you have this massive Overstock here okay so you have shortage here but then you most of the time you do have for Overstock after this cycle and this is what we're going to talk about we have six steps to follow 1 2 3 4 5 six and what I'm going to tell you is it's it's impossible to have a perfect situation all the time but the idea is really to limit the impact on the shortage side and also on the Overstock site and that will be much profitable for you and for your company and much less stress as well because this kind of situation are extremely stressful for the people working in operations and Supply Shain so the first step is you need to before the explosion step number one you need to prepare okay so before this is happening the better is your situation before the better will be your situation during the this crisis so you need to have a plan and validate with everyone okay what is a strategy before because it may happen and the sooner you're going to prepare and you could use my my checklist and presentation as a plan okay you need to have a product classification you need to know before which products are the are the most important one in terms of dollars volume or maybe profit you need to know which one you're ready to sacrifice and which one you are ready to even more like increase the safety to make sure they never uh almost never have all of stock so you need also to clean up all your old obsolete stock Dom stock before you need to have replenishment and inventory management as automatic as possible because it will react much faster sales driven where we call replenishment if it's Drive driven by sales if you sell more you're going to order more and the opposite as well and you need to have up to date supplies lead time and up toate suppli relability to make sure you can also make sure that your all your safety stock and that everything I was explaining before in the profession and expert module is ready to go and you also need to have a clear inventory budget to make sure that okay if you have 10 million budget how much how far can you go if you need to increase your your level because your demand is increasing as well so you need to have the right foundation and that was really the goal of this course and now I think it's much it's much easier for you to know what you have to do then you have this you have this uh demand Peck coming and say okay you need to react quickly and most of the time we don't react quickly enough let's say for the yoga mat what do you have to do so you have multiple steps the first one you need to identify the product groups that are exploding so you need to be very clear because most of the time it's not all the products you need to be very clear versus last year versus last month okay this one are growing by 40% 50% 60% you could you could say like from 30% gross this is uh this is part of the group I need to be re very careful not all of them then you need to shorten or reduce the average sales duration if you use for example the Minimax method or even the REO point I was explaining that in the foundation level but if you have a long average s for example you're using the last last six months average sales and you start selling a lot the last two weeks it will takes two three months to react and to readjust your re point or to readjust your minan max calculation so the idea is really to shorten the period to say okay maybe if you at 6 months or two months you can move to two weeks so it's going to accelerate a lot and reust really really fast what is your new requirement in terms of stocks to to guarantee the service for your customers okay so it could be the same for a factory as well same principle but readjust and have a shortterm average sales duration then what you can do I can give you an example if you want to see the one example for this if you go back to my forast tool oops there we go one so if I go back to my focus s that that's a really good example you could say okay I was my my six months forecast was like this it was 444 pieces a day and then I will say no because we are we have we T to have an acceleration of the sales I'm going to move to uh my four we sales you and you see that my four weeks average sales we are selling twice twice more per day if we only take the last four weeks and if we take the 26 weeks so you see now we have 882 and the new forecast will be much higher I'm going to do it slowly this is the for the yellow one is the forast if I move to this one you see I'm going to reduce a lot because it's less reactive to the latest four weeks of sales all right so you need to reset the next one is you need to reset all manual parameters to make sure that you can also if you have a for example manual minmax safety St point it's important that you everything is clean and behaving according to the sales and not from from a manual parameters that didn't consider this peak uh in the demand then you need also to prohibit manual orders because you won't have enough stock for everyone so if you have for example retail stores or Distributors you should have all your new orders driv by sales and real demand not scarcity because people are afraid of not having enough stock you need to also unlock emergency purchase budget to protect the service so you may need to buy a lot of products but you need to make sure okay but what is my cash flow available can I buy 1 million 10 Millions 100 Millions you need to be very clear with your finance department okay what is my what is my budget because most of the time we forget about it and then we spend too much and then we we have to sacrifice even more because we we order way too many products in the same time I recommend to increase the stock then to of your 2080 in your central warehouse don't increase your stock everywhere it's important to have one location where you will have most of the stock but do it only on your A and B cost don't do it on all your products because you won't have the budget for that so you can increase the target service rate you can adjust the seasonality if you feel it's a new seasonality but this is not the most efficient way if it's not too late you could also increase the if you don't have like your you could increase your coverage or your safety lead time if you don't have any way to do it but only do it on on your a and uh B Cuts because you don't have the budget for everything do not increase your C Cuts your unprofitable and non strategic products and your the products with a lot of uncertainty maybe you have a big pict so you could use I'm going to go back to this after but be very careful with your CZ products with low margins also what you can do you can increase the frequency of delivery to reduce the lead times so you could you could like find a new way like expert transport I'm going to get back to this but you can also increase let's say your super was shipping once a month you could ship once a week or even maybe once a day to increase to reduce the lead time and to have the stock sooner to to be able to follow the demand don't forget to communicate regularly with your suppliers transparency is key share your numbers share the good news share the bad news the list of your strategic products that you want to increase you have to the the sooner you will be clear with your suppliers okay I know you can't do everything you have a limited capacity but only focus on these 50 items you can sacrifice don't you can also as to the suppli you can sacrifice this one but really focus on this one like the seers you want to sacrifice that will be much much more efficient and you could also commit for a longer Peri with your supplier you could say Okay usually only commit for the next months I'm going to commit for the next six months to make sure like you have the visibility you can recruit people buy more components and um it will be safer for him and you will maybe if if you're in competition with other compan companes it will maybe give more volumes for for you than for your competitors it's also very important you monitor your sales and your consumption weekly to make sure that you can adjust and you need also to communicate internally with everyone in the company the sooner you will communicate about the situation okay guys we have the demand is getting insane right now we have an emergency plan we we are ready for it but just be ready we're going to have some we are we are expecting out of stock because we didn't expect this volume the sooner you will communicate the sooner you will have the trust and the people will trust as well your leadership and that's I was really good for this phase because I was rating quickly and I was saying before either you know sales director or marketing or CEO they don't want to have the bad news from their customers they want to have the bad news directly from you and they can see okay Edan knew it he he already has a plan it's okay we it's going to be fine so it's very important this F don't wait for customers to share the B news I said before and regarding the service Focus let's say that you had this strategy you wanted to produce more your your Z products obviously more the a code than the C codes what you could do is you can really switch to okay I'm going to increase my A and B it will be safer to F to protect your ax code for example because uh they have less less uncertainty so you don't have too much risk of over stock but I will definitely not increase my C Cuts because there will be way too much stock so really focus on this one Whatever you want to focus on the most uncertain one or the most stable ones okay next just if you have multi sites so let's say you are Distributing your stock to multiple companies you I really recommend you to centralize your stocks like if you have multiple Warehouse I'm going to give you an example just after but try to do not have too much inventory in too many locations canell all promotions don't forget if you have promotions you're going to sell even faster you don't need promotion because you won't have enough stock reset all replenishment manual parameters in Max reduce all your auto replenishment like ratio like mean Max ratio safety lead time you only want the minimum you don't want safety like if you are Distributing to one like I was Distributing to 2,000 stores I just wanted to to send like few days of inventory not one or two weeks of inventory because I don't have enough safety for everyone so if you have if you add all the safety for all your multiple s right at the end you have way tooo much inventory and at the end it's always the best sellers the biggest stores or Distributors that will get that will go to out of stock much faster than the one who are not selling a lot so reduce all of this and always prohibit manual orders your replacement should be only driven by sales okay so that's something very very important you could also reduce the batch size if you can do if you can do it let's say that you are sending a pallet for every distributor you could say no now we're going to send your box because we we want to reduce the safety per supplier all right so just to give you an example if you are in this situation for example with yogamat what you could say if you really want to make sure you only send the essential is you move all your stock to only one Central distrib distribution distribution centers sorry or you could even reduce the number of DC Regional and Continental or you could do like apple before I was explaining Apple before you could also ship directly from the factory or from only one DC to your consumers and in this specific case you will reduce even more the safety and if you have like for example you need twice more inventory I can tell you that I did this process one one of our Factory burn so that was not a problem of demand that was a problem of supply and we managed to really maintain the sale because we only focus we reduce all the safety and already focus on the the the most important customers okay so that was the second one the third step is during the explosion you need to survive okay now it's too late we don't have enough stock this is this is bad okay uh so what you can do to survive you can do express delivery so I was explaining like you could do F rate only do it on not the profitable items be very careful cost effective and profitable item uh do what you could do you could ask to your customers only deliver the customers who will pay in advance to make sure that you are really focusing on the one that are ready to pay we had the same situation for the covid mask the many suppliers were asking like many Distributors were asking for products with one of my clients and I say to my C look to my distributor look be very careful because they're asking you stock no but probably one month they're going to cancel all your order so you should only focus on the one who already pay for it all right so you you have to really manage your what we call shortage management I was talking about that before you you can go back to my expert level focus on your most important customers and products lower the auto replenishment level prohibit again manual orders you should also if you can do it allocate directly manually the stock by using for example you're going to supply 50% of the demand for every customers not 100% to make sure that there is no safety for any one of them you could also offer like substitution like different products like okay you wanted a yoga mat black I'm going to give you a yoga mat pink oh I'm going to give you a p at Mat it's almost the same it's not the same it's almost the same you could also increase your price uh that's a short-term strategy but sometimes you have to do it like if you don't have enough like the co math at one point we had to pay more like the yoga MTH or everything or the toilet paper and once again the transparent communication is key with your customers your suppliers and inside uh the company right so okay we survive and now you can see that the demand is declining so we need to adjust and most of the company they don't adjust and they have way too much over stock that's the next step right so when the demand decline the key is you need to follow the demand as quick and regularly as possible so you need to ask if you don't have access to the the you need to find the source of the demand if you are selling for example you are making shoes and you're selling to distributor or are selling shoes to stores you should see okay what is the real volume from the stores directly so as to your customers distribut pay if necessary be very attentive to the market signals you can also use Google TRS if you want you can see the volumes be very careful with the bup effect because yes the suppliers for example if you're sing to Distributors they're going to buy a lot one time they're going to overreact so you're going to think oh okay my average is very high so I'm going to buy a lot but at one point they they're not they're not going to adjust really fast and when they're going to adjust it will be too too too late for you and you will have this what we call R effect so you have to be as close as possible from the source of the demon again adjust your replenishment according to sell so I recommend to keep a short average period you you could also like if you you want to to make sure that it's you want to reduce manually you could reust your seasonality or even reduce your safety lead time to understand what is necessary but be careful do not get carry away like of the demand drop you say okay it's crashing too much so I'm going to stop everything ing or you could have you could have another demon Peck you say okay you have a bounce and it's coming back so you need to you need to be very focused only on your most important prods because it's impossible to to control everything and always constant and clear communication again I'm going to repeat myself step number five you have Overstock so you couldnot react as fast as possible you always have a bit of Overstock after this adjustment it's okay with that of course you can check my checklist my 45 steps to reduce your inventory from the expert level and you can so check my next episode to talk about okay what to do when you have too much socks you have a your a demon drop like this one so check my next episode for that okay and the number six after that you need to stabilize and prepare for the next one okay so you need to register maybe your demand will be the same than before you see that the demon was like this when you had a peck drop and then maybe it will be the same maybe it will be plus 30% like the yoga mat or it will be a minus 10% because now we have a lot of people are looking less for your your products you really need to readjust according to the new the new market okay so you need to increase again your average sa period so when I say increase maybe if you had two weeks period you can go back to one month or two months to to be less responsive because you don't want too much volatility you need to reset all your crisis Manu parameters like Service rates Target safety lead times etc etc you need to review your supplies lead time and relability adjust your forecast and new trends I was giving this example uh before like is it do we have a new trend or not if you have automatic forecast that will be much easier that if you do it everything manually correct your historical seasonality next year so maybe you don't want to use this seasonality for next year if you have a huge Drop Like say like you had the World Cup or you had this covid pandemic you don't want to use the the peak you had so you could just erase the peak for next year like for the seasonality trend or you could just collect it manually and what is also very important and most of the time we forget about it and we we just go back to the operations and firefighting mod is formalize the lessons of this crisis with a process and a checklist so you could use my my process but make sure you have more information regarding the tools you are using what are the like the specific example you can explain to the new people because I can tell you that this kind of Crisis will happen multiple times and most of the time we forget about it and then we come back and we just reinvent everything again so that's something you have to be very careful if you're a leader manager formalize the process and train people because you probably have new team members that don't know what happened in the past and at the end don't forget to congrat congratulate and thank your teams your suppliers and your customers it's very important to celebrate this is we are not responsible for the Dem we are responsible to make to find the balance and to always like uh find the the per yeah the to fight back all the situation and we most of the time we also forget to congrat congratulate to congratulate to celebrate to send to to really like uh take a moment to celebrate that okay we've done it once again we we're still alive and uh we made it and also if you had the demon explosion you probably did more sales so don't forget to use a part of this budget to give maybe a bonus to your teams uh because they're responsible for the success of your company and they also could get a reward from this all right so that's it for the explosion of demon you have six steps and the idea is really to lower the impact of shortage and over stock uh to have more Serenity and better results for your company and also this kind of situation will really if you are working as an employee they will really show your your leadership and your capacity to to face this kind of stressful situation I can tell you that I was in this situation and because of my thanks to my methodology I could really show that I was I had the potential to become a manager and a leader and I was very helpful to also help me to to go faster in in my company so do do the same follow my steps improve it and document and I'm sure it will be a a great experience for you as well
in this other bonus we're going to talk about this time demand drop so that's another survival kit this is a bonus in six steps again it's not monetory to get the certificate but once again you should really have a look you have a lot of similar similarities from the the previous one because you will see that we are going anyway to YY effect from too much stocks to not enough and please stay with me and respect these steps if you want to face this kind of situation so let's take another example I like the pandemic example US Car Sal during pandemic and the demand drop by 50% in only one month because basically no one wanted to buy a car right everyone was really afraid okay what's going on minus 50% we had a lot of because of that you have a lot of inventory that is not moving again and you have you need to find a solution for that another example where the the flight or the travel industry the same period was divided by three the volume by three four five depends where where you were in the world but that was a big Challenge and at the end your boss come or your see come to your off and say Edward we have a big problem we don't have enough money or cash flow this is really really bad we're not this is for me the worst scenario because you are not selling and you have too much inventory you not making any money and in the same times you need to pay and your inventory is growing like super super fast because there is no exit for that okay the classic mistakes again they're very similar to the demon explosion you overreact to late you can sell all the orders on all the products so at this situation many times even with very very famous company or like your cf4 Co come to your office and say edar I don't want to know I will just ask you to cancel everything everything because we don't have time for details and you don't want to to go to this situation because that will be a dramatic impact for your sales because you have still selling few products and this one you don't want to sacrifice all of them do you have a manual management to block and up all the orders it's poor and stressful communication with all the suppliers because you are you become very aggressive you say I don't give a I just wanted to to cancel all my orders right you have non profitable Overstock management shortage after demand recovery negative and like communication and repetition of the cycle okay so you have this up and downs that's quite painful at this episode multiple times during my career and this is this is quite challenging and I'm going to give you again the different steps to stop this or at least minimize the impact of the this domino effect so what is happening you have this demand which is dropping right boom it's dropping and then our point is going to recover and then it's going to stabilize again so we have this crisis and the stock will be like this because you are not selling and you didn't react boom it's going to drop no not drop it's going to explode and then you're going to readjust because you're going to cancel and then you will probably have shortage again you will do AF Freight maybe to because you didn't react fast enough and then you will have another stock so we have what we call again the this Yoo you have this Overstock phase and we have six steps one 2 3 four five six and I'm going to tell you again what to do for the six different steps the first one yeah and basically the the idea is really to minimize mitigate the impact you won't be perfect because it's impossible if your demand is dropping by 80% to have a perfect inventory but I'm going to tell you once again how to minimize this impact for the the benefit of your company and your career because this is really important to show that you know what to do and you are not just freaking out when you of these kind of situation so the before the explosion is very similar to my previous episode I'm going to go really fast but you need to have a plan before okay what what would be the plan if something like this happen for example the car industry you know that every five to six years there is this kind of situation so you need to have this plan okay that will be something like mandatory for me you need to have a classification of your products for the the most important products in terms of volume CA like C is like revenue or profit you need to Cle you need to clean the cleaner is your stock before the much easier will be after like everything the the most efficient company always um always managing much better this kind of situation that one that were not efficient before you know if you were already at the limit be when everything was fine when the situation is bad it's even worse for you and most of these company they are in a serious difficulties or they just go to bankruptcy so reduce before the number of references as much as you can automate your replenishment always sales D replenishment um make sure you have the correctly times and the supplies relability centralize your stock again to have as much stocks in the main Warehouse of factory as possible and have a clear inventory budget to make sure okay what is your situation before I was explaining that before if you feel you already have too much T and you feel that the demand looks really bad for the next few months or few years I will definitely have this strategy again yes maybe you're going to pay a bit more in like what we call outborn transport year but you will save so much inventory by once again centralizing your inventory and also reducing the number of reference and maybe also reducing the what we call the minimum order quantity and the shipping lot size quantity that's like clear way I'm going to go back to my 13 Commandments just after but keep it as simple and centralized and automatic as possible before uh this demand drop happen so that was part of my expert and professional level then you have the beginning of the drop step number two you need to react quickly again most of the company they don't react quickly and they re when it's too late so we we have very similar step than when the the demand was exploding you need to identify First what kind of products are exploding not not exploding they're dropping I need to change that they're dropping this time versus last year versus last one doing per group of products per products really focus on the most important one shorten the average sales duration if you are again I will explain you the same thing if you had the two or six months average sales move to 14 weeks and what I was explaining before like if your demand is dropping you you will have much more more reactivity and it will it will not take 6 months to to readjust if you only have the last two weeks average sales you can check my forecasting generator tool for that resed all the manual parameters to make sure for example I see many companies they have manual Safety stock way too high and when the demand is dropping the system is still ordering the quantities that we don't need so be very careful with all these manual parameters you have in the system reduce stock for C codes 8020 especially like in the central warehouse reduce the target service rate I'm going to give example before reduce maybe the supplyer lead times for this specific because if you don't have something too automatic canel all non-firm orders that you don't need and you can also do aggressive promotions on uh specific products to make sure that it's getting better do not lower stocks on aod be very careful with this one you you can reduce the safety but you don't want to lose what is still selling and most of the time we tend to reduce everything so be careful with all your profitable and strategic products permanent and stable if you if you have that are still permanent and stable don't sacrifice them because you're going to lose even more sales that will impact even more your the profits of your company what you can do Al what we call the freeze the order or reason for C produ what is the order reason is like you have an horizon like let's say you have a two two monthly time and after the two monthly time you system will generate orders automatically after two months and you could say no I don't want to generate new automatic orders I'm going to freeze all my orders in the system only for my low low sales products because I don't have the budget for that you could do it not don't do it for everything but do it at least for this kind of products and don't forget to communicate regularly with your suppliers transparency is key uh with your suppliers the products you want to sacrifice and also the product you want to protect a ax a y a z and BX especially okay like before you can't can sell everything maybe your suppliers can reallocate some components and a factory production from low sales to your most strategic products to make sure that at least you can as well survive because the risk is you don't want to kill your suppliers because then when the demand is going to go back you won't have any suppliers anymore and that's what happened during the last pandemic we tend to slow down way too fast and after few month when the demand came back no one was ready to come back so we lose on with the over stock because we did a lot of promotions and we we lost again because we are not ready to go back and it was that's why also we had a lot of inflation because we had way too much volatility with our suppliers and transport as well so make sure you monitor your sales and consumption and communicate as well internally the sooner you will you will explain to everyone okay the situation is bad but we have a plan the better it will be okay and everyone will will help you for that especially the sales team the finance team the production team the logistics team etc etc so regarding the service R if you really want to focus to protect your your because you you know you will have way too much stock I will definitely sacrifice I will move from this situation for example to I won't have any Safety stock on my low sales and very like uncertain product keep in mind like for example in my example in my Consulting example these products represent 70% of the reference you could save a lot of inv by reducing this one but you don't want to sacrifice this one because they are making they only like 5% of your product for example this one that will really save a lot of your sales and profit you could only reduce maybe the most uncertain one because you don't know what's going to happen but this one I will really secure this one to make sure that they're going to be fine all right next limit when you have the Overstock situation here step number three limit the impact so how to limit the impact you can stimulate the demand by aggressive promotion like okay I give you 30% off if you buy one you get one free we were doing that with the Cosmetic or deat as well yeah for example if you have a c code that is not selling and you have an aode that is selling okay you can say okay if you buy my top seller I give you a free product so don't forget these kind of tricks really focus again your promotions on your 2080 customers don't don't spend too much energy on the small ones you can also donate or donate products if it's too late or you can destroy products if for example they have expir dates but don't forget to continue to order what is selling this is very critical and keep with your transparent communication and centralize your inventory again I'm repeating always the same Foundation but most of the companies they're not doing that or they're doing that way too late step number four you are in the recovery mode the demand is coming back but you need to re quickly because otherwise you will have you will have a shortage again because you didn't react too fast enough so the demand recovery you need to follow the demand once again you need to be very attentive to the market signals review your product mix maybe you have new products who are selling more than before as to your customers as before I was explaining you need to be as close as possible from the source of the demand if you are not directly selling to Consumers make sure like if you're a factory get the information of the selling volume not from the distributor but from from the the retail companies to make sure that you know okay what is are the volumes increasing reducing yes or no be very careful with the bull whip effect again adjust your replenishment according to the demand you could keep a short average period if you use that and don't forget also if you are in a strong position if you follow all my methodology I can tell you you will have much less inventory you will be much more efficient and you will be ready to reinvest before your competitors and that's also where if you were good before the this crisis you're going to be even stronger after because you will have more budget and more more power to reinvest and get even more market share after uh the crisis so that was something we were really good in this situation is to get even stronger or use the cash flow we save to buy a competitor for example so do not get carry away you you don't know if it's going to come back now in one year two years you don't know if you will have a second drop but you need always to have a constant and clear communication always number five you have shortage okay we me we mitigate the impact but you have shortage so you can check my previous episode I was talking about how to manage with demon drop so please check this one I was talking about it and number six you need to stabilize and prepare for the next Crisis so okay you you went back to the situation and you have two options or you are selling the same no three options or you are selling the same than before or you s a bit more for example plus 5% or you have a new market now and your your volume dropped by 30% for a specific category of product so you need to be aware what is what is the new trend for this new category and you need to again increase the aess period to be less responsive you don't want volatility reset again your crisis manual parameters review all your lead times relability level adjust your forecast on your A and B code first correct your seasonality if you feel that that was exceptional event I was explained that before if you had a huge Dr like the pandemic covid you I don't think it's going to happen every year at the same time so make sure you don't use this history or change it manually to make sure that there is not like an automatic drop next year formalize again your lesson from this crisis because everyone forget about it and we just repeat the same mistakes each time it's happening so the more will be clear for next one use my process maybe for that but make it even more efficient with uh screenshot which tool to use which parameter to change etc etc and always congratulate and celebrate because this is part of our job to manage this kind of situation so this is it could be fun if you really just accept that okay I'm not responsible for this demand drop but I am the one who can really help the company that's that could be something exciting as well to work and I was to be honest I was really going in this crisis situation again that's why also I got a very good visibility in my company I feel so at the end if you go back to this my goal if you follow this step you will be able to mitigate and uh minimize the impact of this demand drop so I wish you the best it will happen multiple times in your career have a look clearly and once again for me the most important is to have the better situation before this is happening step number one and have all the tools to react as fast as possible to make sure to mitigate the impact
in this bonus I'm going to share with you my certain Commandments to have the most efficient Inventory management it's not only about Inventory management but really the most efficient sulation I'm using this principle for the last 15 years and you'll be able to download them and put it on your table and make sure that you also follow this principles okay so I like to take this example from Amazon Amazon has like leadership principles and I really like them because they use these principles to take any decision in their company so you can pause this video if you want to have a look but this is really deep in the DNA of this company and that's one of for me of the reason of why this company is still growing and innovating that fast in a such a fast pace so I like to keep this example and the I I'm using like in the past I had a post it on my screen and I just wanted to remind remind myself okay but what is the most important Ed word that you should never forget if you want to improve your service improve your avability improve the performance and always because I can tell you that most of the time we tend to firefight every day and we forget we always forget the most important so I'm going to share with you you can see on the right you can download the PDF I really recommend you to print this one maybe put it on your table maybe you can also adapt it to your company but keep in mind that they should be visible and each time you you feel like you are not reaching your goals you don't feel you have good you have enough performance in your company go back to these 13 Commandments or principle so I'm going to read them really quickly that's a good summary of the full methodology I was sharing with you the first one is to centralize and standardize your data you need to have one place where you can have access to all your information like the Bas I was building with you in Excel make sure you don't you don't manipulate the data you should have it as automatic as possible and as standardized as possible that's why I love power query for example for that you could do it directly in your Erp the second one is the second one is to classify your product and your players into ABC and XY Z in the level of volumes profit and the level of uncertainty this is for me mandatory you can go further than than nine categories but I feel like this is a great start and that will really also highlight not only the supply sh all the department into different strategies then you always need to focus your time and energy and money on your 540 or a Cuts then then 20180 the B Cuts that's a principle of life that I'm using not placment for everything in my life from eating to social to sports to anything and that's for me one the principle who made me like reach a lot of things in my life I'm far from the end but that's a principle of life you also need to AC accept shortages on non-profitable low sales so accept shortages on your C cards un non-profitable with a lot of uncertainty it's completely okay and spend time to educate and explain people that it's normal it's not a big deal you cannot have 100% of avability then always try to reduce the number of reference you know like you we have a lot of pressure from marketing and sales but always try to push back that would be the most easy easy way to really like improve your inventory level and most of the time when people wants to add more reference they forget to canel so I like to have this rule if you want to add a new one you need to consel at least one but I like to keep if you want to have a new one we can sell two the next one is to reduce the number of storage points uh it's easy to get loss into the complexity of distribution centers I was giving a lot of example before when you feel you have too much St go back to Simplicity and only one Storage Point that's something like very efficient you need also to be very careful to reduce as much as you can your minimum order of quantity and your load size the impact could be exponential so make sure you always challenge the inventory turnover for minimum order of quantity box size pallet etc etc number eight reduce and stabilize your lead times before even reducing it's good it's very important to have the good information what is my average lead time what is my level of uncertainty and then the shorter will be your leum the better will be your inventory level because this is one of the most important parameters in the formula whatever the formula you are using the next one number nine inventory measurement and forecast should be be 99% automatic so you should definitely start with inventory management first then forast if you have a forast process I'm going to tell you more about have a new program about forecasting coming soon but you should really observe yourself and if you feel like you are doing way too many operations I really go back to okay I will manage everything automatic except exceptions like promotions or special events or crisis uh crisis moment number 10 and that's the most boring with standardize your data is to clear document and share and have shared processes it's really important to really formalize because we rely too much on people people are moving and then you forget everything and then we reinvent the will every every six months every year so spend a lot of time use my process you really adapt to your company and your tools mode make sure it's as clear documented and shared as possible number 11 total cost of ownership approach so I was saying that before don't don't only focus on the cost of the products or the the what is like the the the intermediate benefit always focus on what will be the total profit but maybe by having suppliers closer to your factory or your Warehouse you will maybe pay 10% more but you will have shorter itemp so less stock more flexibility less promotion less less over stock etc etc so so always try to have the big pictures it's not always easy to calculate but at least try to think about it and try to identify the the most important factors number 12 keep it simple Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication and I can tell you this is one of my main fight with ABC supp CH is we have way too many uh comple way too much complexity process tools people with way too much layers of management in most of the companies too to much products too much Warehouse too many suppliers and I can really really encourage you always to try to okay how can I simplify you will have a better life you will have a much efficient life you will have much stress much much less email as well and yeah this is for me very important principle of life and the last one communicate also the good news because we have a lot of good news 95% of your products are available today maybe 90% And that's amazing and it's it's really important to remind people that yeah because people in when we work with people they always blame us because we don't have products or we have too much stock or there is a problem with the lead time but most of the time it's working and we need to remind people the good news because they won't remind the they won't remind us what is working it's like when you go to a supermarket you won't than for oh thank you because my banana or my bagette is available you will we will always tend to complain of what is missing not what is available because we live in this very abundant wall and we forget that you have millions of people like us fighting to make sure you have your product so keep communicating the good news when you reach something when you have a when for example you had the problem with the supply and the supper is back to normal when you have like this crisis management for because your the demon drops or explode please check my previous videos before but always try to communicate also when you fix something when there's a new product when you have a new launch always try to celebrate and also share this good news with everyone thanks people that really help you on the projects I always try to be positive and com you know like contaminate people around me and that's something very that I really enjoy because when you smile usually people like it's SM I'm say you're going to smile too right and that's something I think very important as the mindset for your for your own health as well mental health and also if you want to if you have ambition to grow in your company you have more responsibility most of the time we're going to we're going to give more respons it for people with more like positive attitude and positive mindset so this is my conclusion for this uh this course I'm very grateful that you could share this with me download it adapt if you need imprint it sh share it to your company and to your team members but uh keep keep these principles in mind and that will really simplify your life and improve your your performance as well
hello Mario how are you very good in this episode my friend we're going to talk about how Amazon optimize inventory all the secrets and you probably already know Mario we did a few live webinar talking about forecasting and just quickly to just to to give you an introduction about Mario we are very good friend we met at Deaton 10 or 15 years ago working together in a he was in finance and supply chain and I was in supply chain and he was the guy with numbers and they help me to implement a lot of projects and then Amazon called you and you you move to Amazon and we working with them for more than six years in Inventory management and forecasting for 100 millions of products and you are responsible to improve this forecasting process but very related to the the inventory management process and I I thought it was interesting as well to have you in this specific method to talk about all the secrets about how do you manage inventory at Amazon I think the main challenge is first fact is you you have more 100 millions of products and I I would feel like as an if you were a normal company would just go into a bankruptcy because it's very very complex so you have obviously very strong process you have a lot massive Automation in suppli especially in forecasting and inventory management uh but I also wanted to to go a bit deeper with you on a specific topic regarding inventory management uh for example uh we're talking about the p&l per product can you tell me more about all uh what is this profit and loss per product you have in in Amazon yeah what what uh yeah so having a profit and loss account per product it's it's it's it's critical okay because what what you're doing is basically every time you're taking a decision to buy more inventory or not on a given product is just you you uh let's say you uh compare it with the profitability of the product itself okay MH you don't uh uh you don't like wash out with the other products you say okay you know I'm um I'm basically buying more of this item because I'm buying less of these other item so overall I'm fine okay but instead we are optimizing every single product okay so let's say for example a product is very profitable okay and but has very uh High uncertainty okay but if the pro If the product is very profitable then probably it pays out to have a lot of inventory okay yeah so it's it so after all for this specific product we authorize to buy a lot of inventor okay this is it's very profitable if the is the opposite the price is not very profitable then you know we don't buy much inventor as simple as that you do it on a on a product by product basis okay you don't do compensations between products which is very unique because most of the company in the world they have a budget they say oh I can only spend 100 Millions of dollars of inventory this year and if you reach the top you just shut down everything by 10% and your approach is very different it's product by product but what like having a budget per product yeah but it's defined automatically based on the is it cash flow or profit the cas flow cash flow cash flow so it's cash flow optimization free cash flow yes more free cash flow because it's all about cash flow now and what happen if you don't have do you have unlimited cash in the company or or does it work so I think I mean you can speak about cash or about storage there is always a a a limit of some sort okay some physical limit of some sort so the way you deal with this stuff okay is basically um once you get close to that limit okay close enough that you start to get worried okay yeah then you increase the cost of opportunity of this particular item so let's say for example in typical Amazon use case uh uh storage okay we're running out of storage okay Christmas for example for example we have to you know we're running out of storage so what do you do so in general like the storage cost is very low yeah okay so if you're running out of storage let's say you're 85 90% full okay and you know you still have to buy okay your m still will go up so what you do you basically increase your cost of storage so instead of being I don't know whatever unit like a 5 cents per uh uh cubic meter whatever uh uh you basically increase it by you maybe double it or triple it okay so if you do this the uh the formula that or the model that buys new inventory okay will take it into account yeah so if the for profit for products that are very profitable it will continue buy because even with such a high cost of storage or or products are very small okay so they take very very little space yeah so for so it's so again you you basically you um um modeled the constraint into the into the machine into the model okay so it can Tak the best decision okay so for that specific product you continue buy then for another product okay maybe it's not very profitable and it's very big it's very uh a lot of volume okay uh then you you you will still buy okay you will do it automatically okay uh how do you find the right value of uh you know for examp in this case for storage it could be for uh cost of capital or whatever I think you do it empirically okay it's the best way you just yeah yeah you just inre start increasing it and you see if by increasing it you cut uh uh uh you cut your uh buying by how much is needed okay yeah exactly so I increased by cost of capital by 50% and I decrease my uh um push chases by I don't know 10% okay it's enough it's exactly what I was expecting I was looking for otherwise you keep increasing it you keep increasing your C of capital until you know you T as much uh purchases as you were uh as you need but what happen like because this is very drastic uh but what happen if you you may have full category of Amazon that not available anymore because they're not profitable and you will only have for example iPhone or or gold yeah yeah if you have a specific category of specific products are very very strategic what you can do you you you you put subsidies like uh governments to okay you put subsid on this product so let's say for example it's just VF you don't you don't really put subsidies but you virtual so the when you calculate how much you have to buy you will buy a bit more okay so make example the usual margin of this particular items is two EUR per unit you can put an extra Euro of subsidy okay so when you buy yeah you buy a more than you would have bought otherwise okay so you you you create an artificial profit or on this product yes yes to give a a relative advantage to give this item a relative Advantage compared to let's say you want to have a headphone and you say oh uh this is really not profitable so I'm going to give another $5 extra to make sure I have I have at least the most important one in my in my warehouse yeah and uh okay again I mean these are uh but these are important decisions okay it's very uh you know for example speaking at Amazon it takes a lot of uh seniority to validate these kind of things okay it's just not easy to make of course because you're basically you're basically you basically yeah it's it's it's super strategic super strategic yeah okay but it's very interesting because very it's very interesting because in this way you can really optimize 100 millions of products in a very automatic way and then you only make few exceptions for a strategic group of product which is the beginning of what we we could see together with the XYZ analysis but in this specific case it's much more advanced and you have a pnl per product with the cost opportunity optimization and subsidies and uh the second point I wanted to talk about more about the the probabilistic forecast not only for the demon but also for the lead time can you tell you more about these two topics which are very related to inventory management of course yeah yeah because the the most important inputs of how much should I buy yeah is basically what's my forecast what's my demand forecast yeah and what's my uh supplier lead time yeah okay of course the longer leap time the more I buy the bigger the demand the more I buy of course so uh we don't have just a number for those uh two uh things we have like probabilistic distribution okay so you take it's kind of take it's like if we were taking into account a a risk factor okay so U you know if if you know for sure that LE time is three days and then uh uh the the the demand is I don't know 10 units it's it's super easy okay you just just buy that um but you say for example you're not really sure so the L time maybe three days 10 days okay between three and 10 days okay and then the demand is between I don't know 8 and 15 units okay so if the item again every item you do the same calculation so if the item is very profitable you're going to buy closer to let's say the maximum of your distribution so maybe 15 units or 14 units or 13 units whatever uh and same for the leite time you're taking security okay you you're not really sure about Le time of the supplier so be extra cautious because this item is really profitable you don't want to lose it so you buy a bit more so maybe you say okay it's going to be 10 days 10 days lead time so you're going to buy more okay 10 days lead time plus so you're gonna buy a lot more because you're gonna kind of multiply the lead time for the forecast okay but it's very profitable so it's it's it's it's worth it if if the Prof if the item is not very profitable then you buy at the bottom of the distribution so you buy for aita maybe of three days and then you buy for a demand of eight units and then yeah you might you might go out of stock but you know it's part of the game let's say so I remember I was talking with people from Amazon and you including said oh this produ is a P90 or p50 uh is about the probability I'm going to I want to secure 90% right for example if I say P90 I want to secure 90% of the distribution or probabilistic distribution of this product right and if it's not profitable I'm going to go lower into like for example p50 um right this is the way you work you have specific probab you you you your algorithm will decide a level of probability based on the the opportunity and cost of the product right yeah so exactly what it means let's say P90 it means that you have a 90% probability yeah of selling less than that amount yeah okay so if if P90 is 15 units yeah it means they have 90% probability of selling less than 15 units so if I buy 15 okay it means n nine out of 10 times I will be I will be okay I won't go out of stock yeah okay this is what it means okay and then you do the same for L time so it's kind of a you know double double safety so this is basically we were working on that in the in this course inventory man export where we go much in a much Advanced way and you have all this forecasting model that will supply all of this and for me that's why Amazon is capable of managing so many prod products with profitability is because it's fully toate and have a very Ru like safe rules to make sure you protect the cash flow and the profit of the company so thank you Mario for opening the future for our students and if you want to go deeper with us we are we are talking a lot about forecasting in our forcasting expert course uh you have all the details below and thank you Mario I see you for another episode together
