### ‚úÖ **V2.0: Enhanced Calculation Engine**

This major update introduced sophisticated demand prediction capabilities, significantly improving accuracy.

*   **Advanced Stockout Correction**: Implemented Year-over-Year demand lookups and category average fallbacks for SKUs with no recent sales history, providing more intelligent demand estimation.
*   **Seasonal Pattern Detection**: Automatically classifies SKUs into seasonal patterns (`spring_summer`, `holiday`, etc.) using 2+ years of data to apply predictive demand multipliers.
*   **Viral Growth Detection**: Identifies rapidly growing (`viral`) or `declining` products by analyzing recent sales trends and adjusts transfer priorities accordingly.

---

### ‚úÖ **V3.0: Enhanced Transfer Logic & UI**

Building on V2.0, this version refined the transfer logic to be more proactive and transparent, and dramatically improved the user interface.

*   **Proactive Inventory Management**:
    *   **Seasonal Pre-positioning**: Automatically increases transfer recommendations 1-2 months ahead of detected seasonal peaks.
    *   **Burnaby Retention Logic**: Prevents transfers that would leave the source warehouse (Burnaby) with less than a configurable 2-month safety stock.
*   **Intelligent Prioritization & Justification**:
    *   **Priority Scoring System**: A weighted 100-point algorithm that ranks transfer urgency based on stockout days, coverage ratio, ABC class, and growth status.
    *   **Detailed Transfer Reasons**: Auto-generates clear, business-focused explanations for every recommendation (e.g., "CRITICAL: Class A item with 20+ stockout days and low coverage.").
*   **Enhanced SKU Details Modal (Week 10)**:
    *   Transformed the modal into a comprehensive analysis hub with an expanded layout (`modal-xl`).
    *   **Data Visualization**: Added interactive Chart.js graphs showing sales trends with stockout periods highlighted.
    *   **Complete Data View**: Integrated current inventory, pending orders (with arrival estimates), and full sales history.
    *   **Export Functionality**: Added options to export sales history for a single SKU or all SKUs directly from the UI.

---

### ‚úÖ **Post-Deployment Features & Critical Fixes (Weeks 5-11)**

#### **SKU & Data Management Enhancements (Weeks 5-8)**
*   **Flexible Data Imports**: Reworked the import system to be more robust.
    *   **Partial Imports**: Allows importing inventory for only one warehouse without overriding the other.
    *   **Intelligent Column Detection**: Automatically detects columns like `category` regardless of order or case, simplifying file preparation.
*   **Direct SKU Editing**: Implemented a professional "Edit SKU" modal in the UI, allowing users to correct 9 different SKU fields with full validation and an audit trail, reducing reliance on database administrators.
*   **Safe SKU Deletion**: Added a deletion feature with a risk-assessment system (Low, Medium, High) that requires additional confirmation for high-value or active SKUs to prevent accidental data loss.
*   **Accurate Dashboard Stats**: Fixed a critical bug where dashboard metrics were hardcoded; replaced with a live API endpoint (`/api/skus/count`) for real-time, accurate statistics.

#### **Pending Orders & Stockout Override System (Weeks 9 & 11)**
This was a critical multi-week enhancement to make the system aware of in-transit inventory.
*   **Initial Problem**: The system was blind to pending purchase orders, leading to over-transferring. The initial implementation had several critical bugs.
*   **Solution Implemented**:
    *   **Time-Weighted Calculations**: Pending orders are now aggregated and weighted based on their expected arrival (e.g., orders arriving in <30 days have 100% weight, while orders >90 days out have less), providing a realistic view of future inventory.
    *   **Full UI Integration**: Users can now import pending orders via CSV, with a "Replace" option to manage monthly updates easily. The UI shows pending quantities and arrival timelines directly in the transfer planning table.
    *   **Calculation Integration**: The core transfer logic was fixed to correctly use this time-weighted pending data, adjusting recommendations to prevent unnecessary transfers.
    *   **Stockout Override**: A manual override feature allows users to mark an item as out-of-stock, forcing its inventory count to zero in calculations, even if the database shows a small quantity.

#### **Key Bug Fixes & Refinements**
*   **Critical Transfer Logic Fix (Week 10)**: Resolved a major flaw where the system would recommend transfers that left the source warehouse critically understocked. The logic was rewritten to enforce a 2-month safety stock at the source.
*   **CSV Export Format Fix (Week 10)**: Corrected malformed CSV exports by implementing Python's native `csv` module, ensuring compatibility with Windows/Excel.
*   **Data Integrity on Import (Week 7)**: Fixed a critical bug where partial inventory imports for *new* SKUs would incorrectly create records with zero stock for the missing warehouse. The system now safely skips new SKUs with incomplete data.

## V4.2: Fix Duplicate SKU Issue in Transfer Planning (IN PROGRESS)

### Problem Analysis
The transfer planning page displays duplicate entries for certain SKUs due to improper SQL JOINs with the stockout_dates table:
- **PF-13906**: 6 duplicate entries
- **WF-RO-GAC10**: 2 duplicate entries
- **VP-EU-HF2-FLT**: 2 duplicate entries

### Root Cause
The SQL query in `backend/calculations.py` (function `calculate_all_transfer_recommendations`) uses LEFT JOINs with the `stockout_dates` table without proper aggregation. When an SKU has multiple stockout records (different warehouses or unresolved events), the LEFT JOIN creates duplicate rows.

### Solution Approach
Replace LEFT JOINs with EXISTS subqueries for stockout status checks. This ensures one row per SKU while maintaining accurate stockout status information.

### Implementation Tasks
- [x] **TASK-096**: Document the duplicate SKU issue and solution approach in TASKS.md
- [x] **TASK-097**: Fix SQL query in calculations.py by replacing LEFT JOIN with EXISTS subqueries
- [x] **TASK-098**: Add comprehensive code documentation explaining the fix and rationale
- [x] **TASK-099**: Test with Playwright MCP to verify duplicate elimination and functionality
- [x] **TASK-100**: Verify data integrity, stockout status accuracy, and performance impact

### Technical Requirements
- Maintain stockout status accuracy (kentucky_stockout and burnaby_stockout flags)
- Ensure no performance degradation with EXISTS queries
- Follow existing code documentation standards
- Use EXISTS instead of DISTINCT for cleaner, more efficient solution

### Testing Checklist
- [ ] Verify PF-13906 appears only once in transfer planning table
- [ ] Verify WF-RO-GAC10 appears only once in transfer planning table
- [ ] Verify VP-EU-HF2-FLT appears only once in transfer planning table
- [ ] Confirm stockout status badges display correctly for all SKUs
- [ ] Test performance with full 4000+ SKU dataset
- [ ] Verify no SKUs are missing from results after fix
- [ ] Confirm transfer calculations remain accurate

## V6.3: Stockout Impact Analysis Chart Data Structure Fix (IN PROGRESS)

### Problem Identified
The Stockout Impact Analysis (Pareto Chart) is not displaying any data despite the backend API returning valid stockout data. Root cause analysis revealed a critical **data structure mismatch** between backend and frontend:

**Backend Currently Returns:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": [
    {"sku_id": "AP-2198597", "description": "...", "lost_sales": "12749.07", ...},
    {"sku_id": "UB12220", "description": "...", "lost_sales": "4105.44", ...}
  ]
}
```

**Frontend Expects:**
```javascript
{
  affected_skus: [
    {sku_id: "...", estimated_lost_revenue: 12749.07, ...}
  ],
  total_estimated_loss: 50000
}
```

### Technical Issues Found
1. Frontend expects `data.affected_skus` but receives array directly in `data`
2. Frontend expects `estimated_lost_revenue` field but backend sends `lost_sales`
3. Frontend expects `total_estimated_loss` summary but backend doesn't calculate it
