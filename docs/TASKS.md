### ‚úÖ **V2.0: Enhanced Calculation Engine**

This major update introduced sophisticated demand prediction capabilities, significantly improving accuracy.

*   **Advanced Stockout Correction**: Implemented Year-over-Year demand lookups and category average fallbacks for SKUs with no recent sales history, providing more intelligent demand estimation.
*   **Seasonal Pattern Detection**: Automatically classifies SKUs into seasonal patterns (`spring_summer`, `holiday`, etc.) using 2+ years of data to apply predictive demand multipliers.
*   **Viral Growth Detection**: Identifies rapidly growing (`viral`) or `declining` products by analyzing recent sales trends and adjusts transfer priorities accordingly.

---

### ‚úÖ **V3.0: Enhanced Transfer Logic & UI**

Building on V2.0, this version refined the transfer logic to be more proactive and transparent, and dramatically improved the user interface.

*   **Proactive Inventory Management**:
    *   **Seasonal Pre-positioning**: Automatically increases transfer recommendations 1-2 months ahead of detected seasonal peaks.
    *   **Burnaby Retention Logic**: Prevents transfers that would leave the source warehouse (Burnaby) with less than a configurable 2-month safety stock.
*   **Intelligent Prioritization & Justification**:
    *   **Priority Scoring System**: A weighted 100-point algorithm that ranks transfer urgency based on stockout days, coverage ratio, ABC class, and growth status.
    *   **Detailed Transfer Reasons**: Auto-generates clear, business-focused explanations for every recommendation (e.g., "CRITICAL: Class A item with 20+ stockout days and low coverage.").
*   **Enhanced SKU Details Modal (Week 10)**:
    *   Transformed the modal into a comprehensive analysis hub with an expanded layout (`modal-xl`).
    *   **Data Visualization**: Added interactive Chart.js graphs showing sales trends with stockout periods highlighted.
    *   **Complete Data View**: Integrated current inventory, pending orders (with arrival estimates), and full sales history.
    *   **Export Functionality**: Added options to export sales history for a single SKU or all SKUs directly from the UI.

---

### ‚úÖ **Post-Deployment Features & Critical Fixes (Weeks 5-11)**

#### **SKU & Data Management Enhancements (Weeks 5-8)**
*   **Flexible Data Imports**: Reworked the import system to be more robust.
    *   **Partial Imports**: Allows importing inventory for only one warehouse without overriding the other.
    *   **Intelligent Column Detection**: Automatically detects columns like `category` regardless of order or case, simplifying file preparation.
*   **Direct SKU Editing**: Implemented a professional "Edit SKU" modal in the UI, allowing users to correct 9 different SKU fields with full validation and an audit trail, reducing reliance on database administrators.
*   **Safe SKU Deletion**: Added a deletion feature with a risk-assessment system (Low, Medium, High) that requires additional confirmation for high-value or active SKUs to prevent accidental data loss.
*   **Accurate Dashboard Stats**: Fixed a critical bug where dashboard metrics were hardcoded; replaced with a live API endpoint (`/api/skus/count`) for real-time, accurate statistics.

#### **Pending Orders & Stockout Override System (Weeks 9 & 11)**
This was a critical multi-week enhancement to make the system aware of in-transit inventory.
*   **Initial Problem**: The system was blind to pending purchase orders, leading to over-transferring. The initial implementation had several critical bugs.
*   **Solution Implemented**:
    *   **Time-Weighted Calculations**: Pending orders are now aggregated and weighted based on their expected arrival (e.g., orders arriving in <30 days have 100% weight, while orders >90 days out have less), providing a realistic view of future inventory.
    *   **Full UI Integration**: Users can now import pending orders via CSV, with a "Replace" option to manage monthly updates easily. The UI shows pending quantities and arrival timelines directly in the transfer planning table.
    *   **Calculation Integration**: The core transfer logic was fixed to correctly use this time-weighted pending data, adjusting recommendations to prevent unnecessary transfers.
    *   **Stockout Override**: A manual override feature allows users to mark an item as out-of-stock, forcing its inventory count to zero in calculations, even if the database shows a small quantity.

#### **Key Bug Fixes & Refinements**
*   **Critical Transfer Logic Fix (Week 10)**: Resolved a major flaw where the system would recommend transfers that left the source warehouse critically understocked. The logic was rewritten to enforce a 2-month safety stock at the source.
*   **CSV Export Format Fix (Week 10)**: Corrected malformed CSV exports by implementing Python's native `csv` module, ensuring compatibility with Windows/Excel.
*   **Data Integrity on Import (Week 7)**: Fixed a critical bug where partial inventory imports for *new* SKUs would incorrectly create records with zero stock for the missing warehouse. The system now safely skips new SKUs with incomplete data.

## üìã Current Sprint: CSV Import Warehouse Selection Enhancement

### üéØ **TASK-306: Implement CSV Import Warehouse Selection Feature**

**Objective**: Enhance the stockout management CSV import functionality to support warehouse specification via a 4th column, with backward compatibility for existing 3-column files and proper error handling for invalid warehouse values.

**Context**: The current CSV import for stockout data is hardcoded to only import for Kentucky warehouse. Users need the ability to specify which warehouse (Kentucky, Burnaby, or both) each stockout record applies to during CSV import.

#### Phase 1: Backend Enhancement ‚úÖ

  - [x] Modified `/api/import/stockout-history` in `backend/main.py` to support 4th column
  - [x] Added backward compatibility for 3-column format (defaults to 'kentucky')
  - [x] Added warehouse validation: accepts 'kentucky', 'burnaby', 'both' (case-insensitive)
  - [x] Implemented 'both' option by creating two separate stockout records
  - [x] Enhanced error handling with warehouse-specific error messages
  - [x] Updated docstring with comprehensive CSV format documentation

#### Phase 2: Frontend Documentation Updates ‚úÖ

- [x] **TASK-306.2**: Update Stockout Management UI ‚úÖ
  - [x] Updated CSV format documentation in `frontend/stockout-management.html`
  - [x] Added example showing new 4-column format with warehouse column
  - [x] Updated help text to explain warehouse options with clear examples
  - [x] Added visual indicators for warehouse in import preview
  - [x] Ensured existing functionality remains unchanged

#### Phase 3: Code Documentation & Quality ‚úÖ

- [x] **TASK-306.3**: Add Comprehensive Documentation ‚úÖ
  - [x] Added detailed docstrings following project standards
  - [x] Documented CSV format changes in inline comments
  - [x] Updated function parameter documentation
  - [x] Added business logic explanations for warehouse handling
  - [x] Documented backward compatibility approach

#### Phase 4: Comprehensive Testing ‚úÖ

- [x] **TASK-306.4**: Unit Testing ‚úÖ
  - [x] Tested 3-column CSV import (legacy format) defaults to Kentucky
  - [x] Tested 4-column CSV import with valid warehouse values
  - [x] Tested 'both' warehouse option creates dual records
  - [x] Tested case-insensitive warehouse validation (KENTUCKY accepted)
  - [x] Tested error handling for invalid warehouse values
  - [x] Tested file validation and error messages

- [x] **TASK-306.5**: Playwright Integration Testing ‚úÖ
  - [x] Tested CSV file upload with 3-column format (imported 3 records to Kentucky)
  - [x] Tested CSV file upload with 4-column format (imported 5 records to correct warehouses)
  - [x] Verified stockout records created in correct warehouses (Kentucky, Burnaby, both)
  - [x] Tested error handling displays properly in UI
  - [x] Validated recent updates show correct warehouse information
  - [x] Tested performance with realistic CSV files
  - [x] Verified backward compatibility doesn't break existing workflows

#### Phase 5: Documentation & Deployment ‚úÖ

- [x] **TASK-306.6**: User Documentation ‚úÖ
  - [x] Updated CSV format examples in UI with clear format specifications
  - [x] Created clear help text explaining warehouse options
  - [x] Documented migration path for existing CSV files
  - [x] Added troubleshooting guide for common import errors
  - [x] Updated tooltips and help messages

- [x] **TASK-306.7**: Final Validation & Cleanup ‚úÖ

  - [x] Tested edge cases and error conditions
  - [x] Validated performance remains under 5-second threshold
  - [x] Ensured proper logging for debugging
  - [x] Code review and cleanup completed

#### Success Criteria: ‚úÖ ALL ACHIEVED
- [x] CSV imports work with both 3-column (legacy) and 4-column (new) formats ‚úÖ
- [x] Warehouse can be specified as 'kentucky', 'burnaby', or 'both' ‚úÖ
- [x] Legacy 3-column files default to 'kentucky' for backward compatibility ‚úÖ
- [x] 'both' warehouse option creates records for both warehouses ‚úÖ
- [x] Clear error messages for invalid warehouse values ‚úÖ
- [x] All existing stockout management functionality remains unchanged ‚úÖ
- [x] Performance impact is negligible ‚úÖ
- [x] Code is comprehensively documented following project standards ‚úÖ
- [x] All tests pass including Playwright UI testing ‚úÖ
- [x] User documentation is clear and complete ‚úÖ

#### New CSV Format:
```csv
SKU, Date_Out, Date_Back_In, Warehouse
CHG-001, 2024-01-15, 2024-01-20, kentucky
CBL-002, 2024-02-01, , burnaby
WDG-003, 2024-03-10, 2024-03-15, both
CHG-004, 2024-04-01, 2024-04-05
```

#### Implementation Notes:

4. **Dual Record Creation**: 'both' option creates separate records for both warehouses
5. **Comprehensive Documentation**: Updated UI with clear format examples and help text
6. **Error Handling**: Clear, actionable error messages for validation failures

**Testing Results:**
- **Legacy Format Test**: 3-column CSV imported 3 records to Kentucky (100% backward compatible)
- **Enhanced Format Test**: 4-column CSV imported 5 records (including dual records for 'both' option)
- **Case Sensitivity**: 'KENTUCKY' correctly accepted and processed
- **Warehouse Distribution**: Records correctly created in Kentucky, Burnaby, and both warehouses
- **UI Integration**: Recent updates properly display warehouse-specific information

**Technical Achievements:**
- ‚úÖ Zero breaking changes to existing functionality
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive docstring documentation following project standards
- ‚úÖ Robust error handling with detailed validation messages
- ‚úÖ Performance remains under 5-second threshold
- ‚úÖ All Playwright tests pass with visual verification

**User Impact:**
Users can now specify warehouse in CSV imports using the format:
```csv
SKU, Date_Out, Date_Back_In, Warehouse
ACA-10159, 2024-01-15, 2024-01-20, kentucky
ACF-10134, 2024-02-01, , burnaby
ACA-10169, 2024-03-10, 2024-03-15, both
```

Legacy files without the warehouse column continue to work seamlessly, defaulting to Kentucky warehouse.
