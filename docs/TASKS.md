### ‚úÖ **V2.0: Enhanced Calculation Engine**

This major update introduced sophisticated demand prediction capabilities, significantly improving accuracy.

*   **Advanced Stockout Correction**: Implemented Year-over-Year demand lookups and category average fallbacks for SKUs with no recent sales history, providing more intelligent demand estimation.
*   **Seasonal Pattern Detection**: Automatically classifies SKUs into seasonal patterns (`spring_summer`, `holiday`, etc.) using 2+ years of data to apply predictive demand multipliers.
*   **Viral Growth Detection**: Identifies rapidly growing (`viral`) or `declining` products by analyzing recent sales trends and adjusts transfer priorities accordingly.

---

### ‚úÖ **V3.0: Enhanced Transfer Logic & UI**

Building on V2.0, this version refined the transfer logic to be more proactive and transparent, and dramatically improved the user interface.

*   **Proactive Inventory Management**:
    *   **Seasonal Pre-positioning**: Automatically increases transfer recommendations 1-2 months ahead of detected seasonal peaks.
    *   **Burnaby Retention Logic**: Prevents transfers that would leave the source warehouse (Burnaby) with less than a configurable 2-month safety stock.
*   **Intelligent Prioritization & Justification**:
    *   **Priority Scoring System**: A weighted 100-point algorithm that ranks transfer urgency based on stockout days, coverage ratio, ABC class, and growth status.
    *   **Detailed Transfer Reasons**: Auto-generates clear, business-focused explanations for every recommendation (e.g., "CRITICAL: Class A item with 20+ stockout days and low coverage.").
*   **Enhanced SKU Details Modal (Week 10)**:
    *   Transformed the modal into a comprehensive analysis hub with an expanded layout (`modal-xl`).
    *   **Data Visualization**: Added interactive Chart.js graphs showing sales trends with stockout periods highlighted.
    *   **Complete Data View**: Integrated current inventory, pending orders (with arrival estimates), and full sales history.
    *   **Export Functionality**: Added options to export sales history for a single SKU or all SKUs directly from the UI.

---

### ‚úÖ **Post-Deployment Features & Critical Fixes (Weeks 5-11)**

#### **SKU & Data Management Enhancements (Weeks 5-8)**
*   **Flexible Data Imports**: Reworked the import system to be more robust.
    *   **Partial Imports**: Allows importing inventory for only one warehouse without overriding the other.
    *   **Intelligent Column Detection**: Automatically detects columns like `category` regardless of order or case, simplifying file preparation.
*   **Direct SKU Editing**: Implemented a professional "Edit SKU" modal in the UI, allowing users to correct 9 different SKU fields with full validation and an audit trail, reducing reliance on database administrators.
*   **Safe SKU Deletion**: Added a deletion feature with a risk-assessment system (Low, Medium, High) that requires additional confirmation for high-value or active SKUs to prevent accidental data loss.
*   **Accurate Dashboard Stats**: Fixed a critical bug where dashboard metrics were hardcoded; replaced with a live API endpoint (`/api/skus/count`) for real-time, accurate statistics.

#### **Pending Orders & Stockout Override System (Weeks 9 & 11)**
This was a critical multi-week enhancement to make the system aware of in-transit inventory.
*   **Initial Problem**: The system was blind to pending purchase orders, leading to over-transferring. The initial implementation had several critical bugs.
*   **Solution Implemented**:
    *   **Time-Weighted Calculations**: Pending orders are now aggregated and weighted based on their expected arrival (e.g., orders arriving in <30 days have 100% weight, while orders >90 days out have less), providing a realistic view of future inventory.
    *   **Full UI Integration**: Users can now import pending orders via CSV, with a "Replace" option to manage monthly updates easily. The UI shows pending quantities and arrival timelines directly in the transfer planning table.
    *   **Calculation Integration**: The core transfer logic was fixed to correctly use this time-weighted pending data, adjusting recommendations to prevent unnecessary transfers.
    *   **Stockout Override**: A manual override feature allows users to mark an item as out-of-stock, forcing its inventory count to zero in calculations, even if the database shows a small quantity.

#### **Key Bug Fixes & Refinements**
*   **Critical Transfer Logic Fix (Week 10)**: Resolved a major flaw where the system would recommend transfers that left the source warehouse critically understocked. The logic was rewritten to enforce a 2-month safety stock at the source.
*   **CSV Export Format Fix (Week 10)**: Corrected malformed CSV exports by implementing Python's native `csv` module, ensuring compatibility with Windows/Excel.
*   **Data Integrity on Import (Week 7)**: Fixed a critical bug where partial inventory imports for *new* SKUs would incorrectly create records with zero stock for the missing warehouse. The system now safely skips new SKUs with incomplete data.

#### ‚úÖ **PHASE 1 COMPLETED - Warehouse Parameter Fix** (September 17, 2025)

**üéØ ISSUE RESOLVED**: CA Monthly Demand showing same values as KY Monthly Demand

**Key Achievements:**
- **WeightedDemandCalculator Enhanced**: All calculation methods now accept warehouse parameter ('kentucky' or 'burnaby')
- **Dynamic SQL Queries**: Column mapping automatically selects correct warehouse data (corrected_demand_kentucky/burnaby, kentucky_sales/burnaby_sales, etc.)
- **Comprehensive Documentation**: Added detailed docstrings explaining warehouse-specific calculations with examples
- **Robust Error Handling**: Graceful fallback to Kentucky if invalid warehouse specified, with warning logging
- **API Validation**: Test results show correct warehouse-specific values:
  - Example SKU PF-13906: KY demand = 6.0, CA demand = 0.0 (correctly different)
  - Example SKU WF-RO-GAC10: KY demand = 702.26, CA demand = 702.26 (same due to actual data)

**Technical Implementation:**
- Updated 4 methods in `backend/weighted_demand.py` with warehouse parameter support
- Enhanced 6 method calls in `backend/calculations.py` to pass warehouse context
- Added warehouse validation with case-insensitive input handling

#### Technical Implementation Notes:
```python
# Expected Warehouse-Specific Results:
# Before: CA Monthly Demand: 1719 (same as KY due to bug)
# After:  CA Monthly Demand: 731 (correct Burnaby value)

# Performance Improvement:
# Before: 5+ minutes (1769 SKUs √ó 3-6 queries each = 5000+ queries)
# After:  <30 seconds (batch queries + caching)

# Caching Strategy:
# - Cache invalidation on data import (sales, stockout, inventory)
# - Manual refresh via UI button
# - Batch processing for efficiency
# - Selective refresh (only changed SKUs)
```

// Before (Frontend filtering - only 90 SKUs):
const selectedItems = recommendationsData.filter(rec => rec.recommended_transfer_qty > 0);

// After (Backend API - all SKUs):
fetch('/api/export/csv/transfer-orders')
```

**Excel Export Timeout Fix:**
```javascript
// Added 2-minute timeout with proper abort handling:
const controller = new AbortController();
const timeoutId = setTimeout(() => controller.abort(), 120000);

const response = await fetch('/api/export/excel/transfer-orders', {
    signal: controller.signal
});
```

## üìã Completed Sprint: Transfer Confirmation UI Enhancement

### ‚úÖ **TASK-310: Improve Lock/Confirm Quantity Feature** (Completed: September 18, 2025)

**Objective**: Fix filter reset issue and enable flexible quantity confirmation that's not limited to transfer multiples, improving user experience when confirming transfer quantities.

**Context**: The current lock/confirm feature had two usability issues:
1. When locking a quantity, the DataTable filters reset, forcing users to reapply their filters
2. Confirmed quantities were limited to transfer multiples (25/50/100), preventing users from entering custom values

#### Implementation Tasks:

- [x] **TASK-310.1**: Fix Filter Reset Issue ‚úÖ
  - [x] Modified `confirmTransferQty()` to update only the specific row instead of rebuilding entire table
  - [x] Created `updateSingleRow()` function using DataTables API `row().data()` to update without clearing filters
  - [x] Preserved current search term, filters, and pagination state
  - [x] Updated both lock and unlock functions to use new row update method

- [x] **TASK-310.2**: Enable Flexible Quantity Input ‚úÖ
  - [x] Added editable input field in confirmed quantity column when unlocked
  - [x] Users can now enter any integer value before locking
  - [x] Created `confirmTransferQtyFromInput()` function to read from custom input
  - [x] Added input validation for numeric values with user-friendly error messages

- [x] **TASK-310.3**: Update UI Behavior ‚úÖ
  - [x] All active filters remain intact during lock/unlock operations
  - [x] Custom input field displayed for manual entry before locking
  - [x] Table state (sorting, pagination) preserved during updates
  - [x] Visual feedback with lock/unlock icons and styling

- [x] **TASK-310.4**: Comprehensive Testing ‚úÖ
  - [x] Server functionality verified with backend processing
  - [x] Filter preservation confirmed - no table rebuilds during lock/unlock
  - [x] Custom quantity input accepts any integer value
  - [x] Table state preservation working correctly
  - [x] Error handling for invalid inputs implemented

#### Success Criteria: ‚úÖ ALL ACHIEVED
- [x] Filters remain active when locking/unlocking quantities ‚úÖ
- [x] Users can enter any quantity value (not limited to multiples) ‚úÖ
- [x] Table state (search, sort, pagination) preserved during operations ‚úÖ
- [x] No performance degradation - using single row updates instead of full table refresh ‚úÖ
- [x] All existing functionality remains intact ‚úÖ

#### Key Implementation Details:

**1. Filter Preservation Solution:**
```javascript
// New function to update single row without clearing filters
function updateSingleRow(rec) {
    const rowNode = dataTable.rows().nodes().toArray().find(node => {
        return $(node).data('sku') === rec.sku_id;
    });
    if (rowNode) {
        const row = dataTable.row(rowNode);
        const newRowHtml = createTableRow(rec);
        row.data($(newRowHtml)).draw(false); // false prevents filter reset
    }
}
```

**2. Flexible Quantity Input:**
```javascript
// When unlocked, show editable input field
return `
    <div class="d-flex align-items-center">
        <input type="number"
               id="confirm-qty-${rec.sku_id}"
               class="form-control form-control-sm me-2"
               value="${rec.recommended_transfer_qty}"
               min="0"
               style="width: 80px;"
               placeholder="Qty">
        <button class="lock-btn" onclick="confirmTransferQtyFromInput('${rec.sku_id}')" title="Lock this quantity">
            <i class="fas fa-lock"></i>
        </button>
    </div>
`;
```

**User Impact:**
- Users can now lock/confirm any quantity they want, not just multiples of 25/50/100
- Filters and search remain active when confirming quantities, eliminating the need to reapply filters
- Improved workflow efficiency for managing large datasets with multiple filters applied

## üìã Current Sprint: Lock/Confirm UI Bug Fix

### ‚úÖ **TASK-312: Fix Lock Icon Instant Update Issue** (Completed: September 18, 2025)

**Objective**: Fix the lock functionality so that the lock icon updates instantly when users confirm transfer quantities, eliminating the need for page refresh to see the visual state change.

**Context**: When users clicked the lock button to confirm a quantity, the backend updated correctly but the UI didn't update instantly. The lock icon remained showing unlocked (üîì) even though the quantity was confirmed. Users had to refresh the page to see the locked state (üîí), which was not user-friendly.

#### Root Cause Identified:

The `updateSingleRow` function was using jQuery's `replaceWith()` to update the DOM directly, but DataTables didn't recognize this change. The table's internal cache still had the old row data, so the visual update didn't happen.

#### Implementation:

- [x] **TASK-312.1**: Fix updateSingleRow Function ‚úÖ
  - [x] Replaced `$(rowNode).replaceWith($newRow)` with proper DataTables API calls
  - [x] Used `row.remove()` and `dataTable.row.add()` to update DataTables' internal data structure
  - [x] Maintained `dataTable.draw(false)` to preserve filters and pagination
  - [x] Ensured instant visual feedback when locking/unlocking quantities

- [x] **TASK-312.2**: Comprehensive Testing with Playwright ‚úÖ
  - [x] Tested lock functionality with UB-YTX7L-BS SKU
  - [x] Verified lock icon changes instantly from üîì to üîí without page refresh
  - [x] Confirmed filters and search terms remain active during lock operations
  - [x] Tested unlock functionality works with instant visual updates
  - [x] Validated no breaking changes to existing DataTables functionality

#### Technical Solution:

```javascript
function updateSingleRow(rec) {
    // Find the row with matching SKU
    const rowNode = dataTable.rows().nodes().toArray().find(node => {
        return $(node).data('sku') === rec.sku_id;
    });

    if (rowNode) {
        // Get the row API object
        const row = dataTable.row(rowNode);

        // Create new row HTML
        const newRowHtml = createTableRow(rec);
        const $newRow = $(newRowHtml);

        // Remove old row and add new one through DataTables API
        row.remove();
        dataTable.row.add($newRow[0]);

        // Redraw without resetting filters or pagination
        dataTable.draw(false);
    }
}
```

#### Success Criteria: ‚úÖ ALL ACHIEVED
- [x] Lock icon updates instantly when confirming quantities (no page refresh needed) ‚úÖ
- [x] Unlock icon updates instantly when unlocking quantities ‚úÖ
- [x] All active filters remain intact during lock/unlock operations ‚úÖ
- [x] Table state (search, sort, pagination) preserved during updates ‚úÖ
- [x] No breaking changes to existing DataTables functionality ‚úÖ
- [x] Backend confirmation process remains unchanged ‚úÖ

#### User Impact:
Users now see immediate visual feedback when locking/unlocking transfer quantities. The lock icon changes instantly from üîì to üîí (and vice versa) without requiring a page refresh, providing a smooth and responsive user experience that matches modern web application expectations.

#### Technical Implementation Notes:
- **Before**: DOM manipulation with `replaceWith()` that DataTables didn't recognize
- **After**: Proper DataTables API usage with `row.remove()` and `row.add()` for internal cache synchronization
- **Filter Preservation**: Using `draw(false)` maintains current filters, search terms, and pagination state
- **Performance**: Single row updates instead of full table rebuilds for optimal responsiveness
