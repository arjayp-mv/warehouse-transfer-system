● You're absolutely right! The pressSequentially() method from the claudesuggestion.md is actually a better and more comprehensive solution 
  for this type of issue.

  The problem is that pressSequentially() is a Playwright method for automation testing, but we need to apply the same principle to fix the 
  manual user input issue.

  Why pressSequentially() is Better

  From the suggestion:
  - fill() (like our current approach): Sets value instantly, triggers only input event
  - pressSequentially(): Simulates actual typing, triggers keydown, input, keyup for each character

  Applying the Same Principle to Manual Input

  The real issue is that your JavaScript might be listening for specific event sequences that manual typing generates but our Lock All button     
  doesn't replicate.

  Let me implement the pressSequentially() concept for the Lock All button:

● What This pressSequentially() Approach Does

  This is a much more comprehensive solution that exactly mimics what pressSequentially() does in Playwright:

  Full Event Simulation:

  1. Clear field → input event
  2. For each character:
    - keydown event (key press)
    - Update field value incrementally
    - input event (value change)
    - keyup event (key release)
    - 10ms delay (human typing speed)
  3. Final events:
    - change event (field completed)
    - blur event (focus lost)

  Why This Should Fix It:

  - Triggers ALL events that manual typing would generate
  - Character-by-character value building (not instant)
  - Proper timing with delays between keystrokes
  - Complete event sequence including focus management

  This approach addresses the root cause mentioned in claudesuggestion.md: your JavaScript validation probably depends on specific event
  sequences (keydown, keyup, change, blur) that only manual typing or pressSequentially() generates properly.

  Try the Lock All button now - it should behave exactly like manual typing!
