I'll help you create a comprehensive and improved supplier ordering plan. Let me start by searching the project knowledge for relevant information, then analyze your uploaded files and our previous conversations.Based on my comprehensive analysis of your supplier ordering plan, the warehouse SQL schema, the forecasting and inventory management knowledge base, and our previous conversations, I'll provide an **enhanced and improved supplier ordering plan** that leverages all the sophisticated features you've already built.

## ðŸ“Š **Comprehensive Analysis & Improvements**

### **1. Key Gaps in Current Plan**

After analyzing your existing plan (lines 1-1951) against your actual SQL schema and knowledge base, I've identified several critical features that aren't fully utilized:

#### **Missing Features from Your SQL Schema:**

1. **Stockout Pattern Integration** (Tables: `stockout_patterns`, `stockout_dates`, `stockout_updates_log`)
   - Current plan doesn't leverage your sophisticated stockout tracking
   - Knowledge base emphasizes correcting demand when availability < 100% (Forecasting_Transcript.txt - stockout correction formula)

2. **Forecast Accuracy Learning** (Table: `forecast_accuracy` with learning fields)
   - Your system tracks `learning_applied` and `stockout_affected` flags
   - Should feed back into order calculations for continuous improvement

3. **Supplier Shipment History** (Table: `supplier_shipments`)
   - Historical performance data not being used for dynamic lead time adjustment
   - Knowledge base recommends tracking delays and adjusting (Inventory_Management_Expert - "track delays and readjust lead time")

4. **Demand Statistics Integration** (Table: `sku_demand_stats`)
   - Contains volatility metrics crucial for safety stock calculations
   - `coefficient_variation` directly impacts safety stock levels

## ðŸ“ˆ **Enhanced Supplier Ordering Algorithm**

### **2. Improved Order Calculation Formula**

Based on the inventory management knowledge base's recommendations:

```python
def calculate_enhanced_order_quantity(sku_id, warehouse, supplier):
    """
    Enhanced calculation incorporating all available features.
    Based on Inventory Management Expert recommendations.
    """
    
    # 1. Get corrected demand (incorporating stockout correction)
    corrected_demand = get_corrected_demand(sku_id, warehouse)
    
    # 2. Dynamic lead time calculation with uncertainty
    lead_time_data = get_dynamic_lead_time(supplier, warehouse)
    
    # 3. Enhanced safety stock with multiple factors
    safety_stock = calculate_dynamic_safety_stock(
        sku_id, 
        corrected_demand,
        lead_time_data,
        warehouse
    )
    
    # 4. Review period optimization
    review_period = optimize_review_period(lead_time_data['avg_lead_time'])
    
    # 5. Calculate with forecast learning adjustments
    order_qty = calculate_with_learning(
        corrected_demand,
        lead_time_data,
        safety_stock,
        review_period,
        current_inventory,
        pending_orders
    )
    
    return order_qty
```

### **3. Corrected Demand Calculation**

From the knowledge base (lines from Inventory_Management_Expert):

```python
def get_corrected_demand(sku_id, warehouse):
    """
    Implement stockout correction formula from knowledge base.
    Reference: Inventory Management Expert - stockout correction
    """
    # Get from stockout_patterns table
    stockout_data = query("""
        SELECT sp.*, sd.stockout_days, sd.warehouse
        FROM stockout_patterns sp
        LEFT JOIN stockout_dates sd ON sp.sku_id = sd.sku_id
        WHERE sp.sku_id = %s AND sd.warehouse = %s
    """, [sku_id, warehouse])
    
    # Apply correction formula (Knowledge base recommendation)
    if stockout_data['availability'] < 100:
        # Formula: Corrected Demand = Actual Ã— (1 + (1 - Availability%) Ã— 50%)
        correction_factor = (1 - stockout_data['availability']/100) * 0.5
        
        # Cap at 30% stockout level (Knowledge base: "if availability < 30%, max 35% uplift")
        if stockout_data['availability'] < 30:
            correction_factor = 0.35
            
        corrected = stockout_data['actual_demand'] * (1 + correction_factor)
    else:
        corrected = forecast['avg_monthly_qty']
    
    return corrected
```

### **4. Dynamic Lead Time with Uncertainty Classification**

Based on Inventory Management Expert transcript about supplier uncertainty:

```python
def get_dynamic_lead_time(supplier, warehouse):
    """
    Use actual lead time statistics with reliability scoring.
    Reference: Lines 66-82 of current plan + knowledge base enhancements
    """
    # Query enhanced supplier_lead_times table
    lead_time = query("""
        SELECT 
            avg_lead_time,
            median_lead_time,
            p95_lead_time,
            std_dev_lead_time,
            coefficient_variation,
            reliability_score,
            -- Calculate safety lead time based on uncertainty
            CASE 
                WHEN coefficient_variation <= 0.15 THEN 'LOW'
                WHEN coefficient_variation <= 0.35 THEN 'MEDIUM'
                ELSE 'HIGH'
            END as uncertainty_level,
            -- Use P95 for high uncertainty, P75 for low
            CASE
                WHEN coefficient_variation > 0.35 THEN p95_lead_time
                WHEN coefficient_variation > 0.15 THEN 
                    avg_lead_time + std_dev_lead_time
                ELSE avg_lead_time
            END as planning_lead_time
        FROM supplier_lead_times
        WHERE supplier = %s AND destination = %s
    """, [supplier, warehouse])
    
    return lead_time
```

### **5. Enhanced Safety Stock Calculation**

Incorporating all factors from the knowledge base:

```python
def calculate_dynamic_safety_stock(sku_id, demand, lead_time_data, warehouse):
    """
    Multi-factor safety stock calculation.
    Reference: Inventory Management Expert - dynamic safety stock

        FROM skus s
        LEFT JOIN sku_demand_stats sds ON s.sku_id = sds.sku_id
        LEFT JOIN (
            SELECT sku_id, AVG(absolute_percentage_error) as avg_mape
            FROM forecast_accuracy 
            WHERE warehouse = %s 
            GROUP BY sku_id
        ) fa ON s.sku_id = fa.sku_id

    }
    
    z_score = service_levels.get(
        f"{sku_data['abc_code']}{sku_data['xyz_code']}", 
        1.65  # Default 95%
    )
    
    # Calculate components
    lead_time_months = lead_time_data['planning_lead_time'] / 30
    
    # Demand uncertainty
    demand_std = demand * (sku_data['demand_cv'] or 0.3)
    
    # Lead time uncertainty  
    lt_uncertainty = lead_time_data['coefficient_variation']
    
    # Combined uncertainty formula (Knowledge base)
    safety_stock = z_score * sqrt(
        (demand_std ** 2) * lead_time_months +
        (demand ** 2) * (lt_uncertainty ** 2)
    )
    
    # Adjustments for special cases
    if sku_data['status'] == 'Death Row':
        safety_stock *= 0.5  # Reduce for phase-out
    elif sku_data['avg_mape'] and sku_data['avg_mape'] > 50:
        safety_stock *= 1.2  # Increase for poor forecast accuracy
        
    # Minimum safety stock for critical items
    if sku_data['abc_code'] == 'A':
        min_safety = demand * 0.5  # At least 2 weeks
        safety_stock = max(safety_stock, min_safety)
    
    return round(safety_stock)
```

### **6. Review Period Optimization**

From Inventory Management Expert recommendations:

```python
def optimize_review_period(avg_lead_time_days):
    """
    Dynamic review period based on lead time.
    Reference: Inventory Management Expert - review period optimization
    """
    if avg_lead_time_days <= 7:
        return 1  # Daily ordering
    elif avg_lead_time_days <= 30:
        return 7  # Weekly ordering  
    elif avg_lead_time_days <= 90:
        return 14  # Bi-weekly
    else:
        return 30  # Monthly for long lead times

## ðŸš€ **New Features to Add**

### **8. Supplier Reliability Dashboard**

```sql
-- Create view for supplier performance monitoring
CREATE VIEW supplier_performance_dashboard AS
SELECT 
    s.supplier_name,
    slt.destination,
    slt.reliability_score,
    slt.avg_lead_time,

FROM suppliers s
JOIN supplier_lead_times slt ON s.supplier_name = slt.supplier
LEFT JOIN supplier_shipments ss ON s.supplier_name = ss.supplier

### **9. Forecast Learning Integration**

```python

## ðŸ’¡ **Key Improvements Over Original Plan**

1. **Stockout-Aware Demand** - Uses your sophisticated stockout tracking to correct demand (Lines 189-213 enhanced)
2. **Dynamic Lead Times** - Leverages actual shipment history instead of static 120 days
3. **Learning System** - Incorporates forecast accuracy feedback loop
4. **Uncertainty Classification** - Three-tier supplier reliability system
5. **Review Period Optimization** - Varies ordering frequency by lead time
6. **Forecast Confidence** - Adjusts safety stock based on MAPE scores
7. **Pending Order Timing** - Only counts orders arriving within planning horizon

## ðŸ“Š **Example Calculation with All Features**

Using your example SKU: **UB-YTX14-BS** (12V Battery) for Kentucky:

```
Current Inventory: 12 units
Pending Orders: 0 units
Base Monthly Demand: 48.3 units
Stockout Days Last Month: 5 days (16.7% unavailability)

Step 1: Corrected Demand
- Stockout correction: 48.3 Ã— (1 + 0.167 Ã— 0.5) = 52.3 units/month

Step 2: Dynamic Lead Time (Universal Battery â†’ KY)
- Historical avg: 55 days
- P95: 68 days
- CV: 0.18 (MEDIUM uncertainty)
- Planning lead time: 60 days (avg + 0.5 Ã— std_dev)

Step 3: Review Period
- For 60-day lead time: 14 days (bi-weekly ordering)

Step 4: Enhanced Safety Stock
- ABC-XYZ: AX (99% service, Z=2.33)
- Demand std dev: 52.3 Ã— 0.15 = 7.8 units
- Lead time uncertainty: 0.18
- Safety Stock = 2.33 Ã— âˆš((7.8Â² Ã— 2.47) + (52.3Â² Ã— 0.18Â²))
- Safety Stock = 2.33 Ã— âˆš(150.1 + 88.5) = 2.33 Ã— 15.4 = 36 units

Step 5: Reorder Point
- Demand during LT+RP: 52.3 Ã— (74/30) = 129 units
- Reorder Point: 129 + 36 = 165 units

Step 6: Order Quantity
- Current Position: 12 + 0 = 12
- Order Qty: 165 - 12 = 153 units
- Round to 50s: 200 units âœ“

Step 7: Coverage Check
- New Position: 12 + 200 = 212 units
- Coverage: 212 Ã· 52.3 = 4.1 months âœ“ (within 6-month max)
```

This enhanced calculation provides **200 units** vs the original plan's result, with better consideration of stockout history, actual lead time variability, and forecast learning adjustments.

## ðŸŽ¯ **Summary**

This improved plan leverages **ALL** your sophisticated SQL features including stockout tracking, forecast accuracy learning, supplier reliability metrics, and dynamic lead times. It follows the inventory management expert's recommendations from your knowledge base while incorporating the lessons learned from your previous conversations about forecast accuracy and supplier performance.

The key innovation is treating ordering as a **learning system** that continuously improves based on actual performance data, rather than static calculations.
