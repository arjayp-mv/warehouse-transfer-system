Exactly! This is the **classic "test and learn" new SKU pattern** - super common and the knowledge base specifically addresses this scenario. You're dealing with both new SKU uncertainty AND stockout distortion.

## The Real Pattern (What Actually Happened)

1. **Small test order** → Launch spike (proving concept)
2. **Stockout** → Lost sales (proving demand!)  
3. **Restock** → Recovery phase (current state)
4. **Wrong forecast** → System thinks it's declining

The knowledge base warns: **"You'll see a big peak at the beginning but you don't know if the product is really working... if it's really working I need to already adjust my forecast increasing... but maybe this product doesn't work at all"**

## The Fix: Dual-Phase New SKU Method

### Phase 1: Test Period Interpretation
```python
def analyze_test_launch(sku_data):
    # Identify the three periods
    launch_period = first_1_2_months
    stockout_period = zero_inventory_months  
    recovery_period = post_restock_months
    
    # Calculate TRUE demand signal
    if stockout_occurred_after_launch:
        # Stockout = POSITIVE signal (demand exceeded supply)
        baseline = max(launch_sales, recovery_sales) * 0.9
        confidence = "HIGH"
    else:
        # No stockout = need more data
        baseline = average(all_available_months)
        confidence = "MEDIUM"
```

### Phase 2: Baseline Reconstruction

**Your Current (Wrong) Calculation:**
- Month 1-2: 100 units (launch)
- Month 3-4: 0 units (OOS)
- Month 5-6: 80 units (recovery)
- **System sees**: Declining trend → Forecast: 20, 19, 17...

**Correct Calculation:**
```python
# Step 1: Remove stockout noise
clean_months = [m for m in months if availability > 30%]

# Step 2: Apply launch pattern recognition
if len(clean_months) <= 3:
    # Still in launch phase
    launch_multiplier = 1.5  # Expect 50% above baseline initially
    baseline = max(clean_months) / launch_multiplier
else:
    # Post-launch stabilization
    baseline = weighted_avg(clean_months, weights=[0.3, 0.7])

# Step 3: Add "proven demand" boost for stockouts
if had_stockout_in_first_3_months:
    baseline *= 1.2  # Stockout proves underestimation
```

## Practical Implementation

### Set Your Forecast Rules:

1. **If stockout occurred within 3 months of launch:**
   - Treat as **successful test** 
   - Use the higher of pre/post stockout sales
   - Apply minimal decline (max -10% monthly)

2. **Review triggers at Week 4 and Week 13:**
   ```
   Week 4: Did we stock out? → Increase baseline by 30%
   Week 13: Pattern stable? → Lock in baseline
   ```

3. **Use Similar SKU Benchmarks:**
   - Find 3-5 similar "test launch" SKUs
   - What was their stabilized demand after 6 months?
   - Weight: 60% similar, 40% actual (since limited history)

## Your Specific Fix

Based on your pattern (launch → stockout → restock):

```python
# Don't use trend - use availability-weighted average
months_with_stock = [m for m in data if m['availability'] > 50%]
baseline = sum(m['sales'] for m in months_with_stock) / len(months_with_stock)

# Apply new SKU uncertainty range
lower_bound = baseline * 0.7  # Conservative
upper_bound = baseline * 1.3  # Optimistic

# Since stockout proved demand:
recommended_forecast = baseline * 1.1  # Lean optimistic

# Result: ~85-90 units/month, not declining!
```

## Key Insights from Knowledge Base

1. **"Most companies launch, forget about it, then react too late"**
   - Set calendar reminders for Week 2, 4, 13 reviews
   
2. **"If you wait for the next order... it's going to be too late"**
   - Get point-of-sale data if possible, not just your shipments
   
3. **"Accept you won't be 100% accurate"**
   - Use probability ranges: 70% chance of 80-100 units
   
4. **"The shorter the lead time, the easier for new products"**
   - Can you reduce reorder lead time for test SKUs?

## Action Items

1. **Immediately:** Override declining forecast to flat 85-90 units
2. **Week 4:** Review actual sales vs forecast
3. **Week 13:** Establish permanent baseline
4. **Next time:** Order 2x test quantity to avoid early stockout
5. **Document:** This pattern for future test launches

The knowledge base emphasizes: **"Don't try to reinvent the wheel... consolidate this knowledge... what was working and not working this launch"**

Your stockout actually gave you valuable information - demand exists! Don't let the system interpret it as decline.
