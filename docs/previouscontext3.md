  What Was Accomplished

  Problem Context

  We implemented an expert "Test & Learn" pattern for new SKU forecasting (SKUs with < 12 months of data) based on industry best practices. The pattern detection was        
  working, but forecasts were still too low (19.63 units instead of expected ~60-110 units).

  Root Cause Analysis

  Combined analysis from my investigation + ChatGPT analysis in docs/claudesuggestions2.md identified 7 critical issues:

  1. Similar SKUs Query Bug (FIXED): status = 'active' (lowercase) didn't match database 'Active' (capital A) - caused _find_similar_skus() to return empty list
  2. Pattern Baseline Blending Bug (FIXED): Code was blending expert pattern calculation with similar SKUs (80/20 split), diluting the correct baseline
  3. Safety Multiplier Double-Counting (FIXED): Pattern already had 1.2x boost, but code applied another 1.3-1.5x multiplier = double-counting
  4. View Returns Low Values: v_sku_demand_analysis may be returning ~27 units for UB-YTX7A-BS (needs verification)
  5. Pending Inventory for "Combined": Query fails to sum both warehouses when warehouse='combined'
  6. Growth Rate Source Not Persisting: Metadata shows empty string in database
  7. View Dependency: Need to verify v_sku_demand_analysis view exists and has data

  Code Changes Made (All in backend/forecasting.py)

  Fix 1: Lines 1000 and 1122 - Status Case Sensitivity

  # Changed from:
  AND status = 'active'
  # To:
  AND status = 'Active'
  Impact: Similar SKUs will now be found, enabling proper baseline calculations.

  Fix 2: Lines 876-900 - Remove Pattern Blending

  # Before: Blended pattern with similar SKUs (80/20)
  if baseline_from_pattern is not None:
      base_demand = baseline_from_pattern
      if base_from_similar > 0:
          base_demand = (baseline_from_pattern * 0.8) + (base_from_similar * 0.2)

  # After: Use pattern directly without blending
  if baseline_from_pattern is not None:
      base_demand = baseline_from_pattern
      print(f"[DEBUG V7.3] Using pattern baseline: {base_demand:.2f} (no blending)")
  Impact: Expert pattern calculation preserved without dilution.

  Fix 3: Lines 916-944 - Reduce Safety Multiplier for Pattern Forecasts

  # Before: Always used 1.3-1.5x safety multiplier
  safety_multiplier = 1.5 if available_months < 3 else 1.3

  # After: Check if pattern-based first
  if baseline_from_pattern is None:
      # Standard path: 1.3-1.5x multiplier
      safety_multiplier = 1.5 if available_months < 3 else 1.3
  else:
      # Pattern path: 1.1x only (already has 1.2x boost)
      safety_multiplier = 1.1
      print(f"[DEBUG V7.3] Pattern detected - using minimal safety multiplier")
  Impact: Avoids double-counting adjustments.

  Debug Logging Added

  All STEP 3 paths now have debug prints:
  - "Using pattern baseline: X.XX (no blending)"
  - "Blended baseline: actual=X, similar=Y, result=Z"
  - "Using actual only: X.XX"
  - "Using similar only: X.XX"
  - "Using category average: X.XX"
  - "pending_qty=X, safety_multiplier=Y"
  - "adjusted_base_demand: X.XX"

  What Still Needs To Be Done

  IMMEDIATE (Critical for Verification)

  1. Generate New Forecast Run
    - Name: "V7.4 Expert Pattern Fixed"
    - Warehouse: Combined
    - Use Playwright to navigate to: http://localhost:8000/static/forecasting.html
    - Generate forecast and check logs for debug output
  2. Verify UB-YTX7A-BS Results
    - Query: SELECT forecast_run_id, sku_id, base_demand_used, method_used, growth_rate_source, month_1_qty FROM forecast_details WHERE sku_id = 'UB-YTX7A-BS' ORDER BY      
  forecast_run_id DESC LIMIT 1;
    - Expected:
        - base_demand_used: ~60-65 units (not 19.63)
      - method_used: "limited_data_test_launch"
      - growth_rate_source: "proven_demand_stockout"
      - month_1_qty: ~60-65 units
    - Current (broken): 19.63, "limited_data_multi_technique", empty, 20
  3. Regression Test UB-YTX14-BS
    - Query: Same as above but WHERE sku_id = 'UB-YTX14-BS'
    - Expected: Still shows 1,500-2,800 range (established SKU unchanged)

  SECONDARY (Nice to Have)

  4. Verify View Data
  SELECT sku_id, demand_3mo_weighted, demand_6mo_weighted
  FROM v_sku_demand_analysis
  WHERE sku_id = 'UB-YTX7A-BS';
    - If NULL or very low, this explains why fallback was used
  5. Fix Pending Inventory for Combined Warehouse (Low Priority)
    - Update _get_pending_quantity() method to sum both warehouses when warehouse='combined'
    - Currently at line ~1070 in backend/forecasting.py
  6. Fix Growth Rate Source Persistence (Cosmetic Issue)
    - Debug why metadata growth_rate_source is empty in database
    - Check INSERT statement at lines 662-677 in save_forecast()

  CLEANUP

  7. Remove Debug Print Statements
    - Lines 880, 887, 891, 895, 900 (STEP 3 debug prints)
    - Lines 940, 942, 944 (STEP 6 debug prints)
    - Lines 431, 439 (existing month check debug prints)
    - Only remove after confirming fixes work!

  Expected Calculation for UB-YTX7A-BS

  Raw Data: [Jan:0, Feb:0, Mar:24, Apr:133, May:100, Jun:1, Jul:38, Aug:14, Sep:31]

  Pattern Detection:
  - Clean months (>30% avail): [24, 133, 100, 38, 14, 31]
  - Launch spike detected: 133 > avg([24,100,38,14,31]) * 1.3 ✅
  - Early stockout: June shows 1 unit ✅

  Calculation:
  - Weighted avg: (recent_3 * 0.7) + (older_3 * 0.3)
  - Recent: [38, 14, 31] avg = 27.67
  - Older: [24, 133, 100] avg = 85.67
  - Weighted: (27.67 * 0.7) + (85.67 * 0.3) = 45.07
  - Stockout boost: 45.07 * 1.2 = 54.08
  - Safety multiplier: 54.08 * 1.1 = 59.49 units

  Final Expected: ~60 units/month (not 19.63)

  Server Status

  - Running in background: Process 5fa688 (main) and f797d1 (backup)
  - Auto-reload detected changes in backend/forecasting.py
  - Server should be ready to accept new forecast requests
