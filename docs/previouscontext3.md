  Current Task

  Testing the V9.0 Supplier Ordering System using Playwright MCP, specifically completing end-to-end testing of the supplier ordering UI and      
  API.

  What Was Accomplished

  1. Fixed Database Connection Pattern (COMPLETED)

  Problem: The supplier ordering API was written using SQLAlchemy ORM pattern (from database import get_db, Session, text(), :param style) but    
   the project uses direct PyMySQL connections.

  Files Fixed:
  - backend/supplier_ordering_api.py (518 lines) - Completely refactored
  - backend/supplier_ordering_queries.py (160 lines) - Converted from SQLAlchemy to plain SQL

  Changes Made:
  - Changed imports from from database import get_db to from backend.database import execute_query
  - Removed all SQLAlchemy imports (Session, text(), Depends(get_db))
  - Removed dependency injection pattern from all 7 endpoints
  - Changed parameterized query format from :param_name to %s
  - Changed params from dict to tuple format
  - Changed execute_query calls from fetch_mode='one' to fetch_one=True, fetch_all=False
  - Changed execute_query calls from fetch_mode='all' to fetch_one=False, fetch_all=True
  - Changed execute_query calls from fetch_mode='none' to fetch_one=False, fetch_all=False
  - Removed all db.commit() calls (execute_query handles commits automatically)

  2. Fixed Column Name Mismatch (COMPLETED)

  Problem: Queries referenced s.unit_cost but the actual column name in the skus table is cost_per_unit.

  Files Fixed:
  - backend/supplier_ordering_queries.py - All 3 queries (build_orders_query, stats_query, supplier_query)
  - backend/supplier_ordering_api.py - generate_recommendations endpoint

  Changes Made:
  - Changed all references from s.unit_cost to s.cost_per_unit
  - Changed all references from s.unit_cost in calculations to s.cost_per_unit

  What Still Needs to Be Done

  1. CRITICAL: Server Reload Required

  The server detected file changes and started reloading but the reload may not have completed. You need to:

  Action: Check if server reload completed successfully by looking for this line in server logs:
  INFO - Supplier ordering API routes loaded successfully

  If not present, restart the server manually:
  cd "C:\Users\Arjay\Downloads\warehouse-transfer"
  python -m uvicorn backend.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --reload

  2. Test the API Endpoint

  Once server is running, refresh the Playwright browser at:
  http://localhost:8000/static/supplier-ordering.html

  Expected Result: Page should load without the "Unable to load order recommendations" alert.

  Current Status: Last API call returned 500 error with "Unknown column 's.unit_cost'" but this was BEFORE the latest fixes were applied.

  3. Complete Playwright Testing Checklist

  Once the API works, complete these tests using Playwright MCP:

  Basic UI Tests:

  - Page loads successfully ✓ (completed)
  - Page structure displays correctly ✓ (completed)
  - API call succeeds without errors
  - Summary cards display data (instead of "--")
  - Filter dropdowns populate
  - DataTable displays order rows

  Generate Recommendations Test:

  - Click "Generate Recommendations" button
  - Verify loading overlay appears
  - Verify API POST to /api/supplier-orders/generate succeeds
  - Verify summary cards update with counts
  - Verify table populates with data

  Filter Tests:

  - Test warehouse filter dropdown
  - Test supplier filter dropdown
  - Test urgency level filter dropdown
  - Test SKU search box

  Inline Editing Tests:

  - Click and edit confirmed_qty field
  - Verify auto-save after 500ms
  - Test lead_time_days_override editing
  - Test expected_arrival_override date picker
  - Test notes field editing

  Lock/Unlock Tests:

  - Click lock button on an order
  - Verify lock icon changes state
  - Verify editable fields become disabled
  - Click unlock button
  - Verify fields become editable again

  SKU Details Modal Tests:

  - Click SKU link to open modal
  - Verify Overview tab displays
  - Click Pending Orders tab
  - Click 12-Month Forecast tab
  - Click Stockout History tab
  - Test modal close functionality

  Excel Export Test:

  - Click "Export to Excel" button
  - Verify file download triggers
  - Verify success message appears

  4. Document Test Results

  After testing, update the todo list using TodoWrite tool to mark tasks as completed.

  Current Todo List Status

  1. [in_progress] Test supplier ordering UI components (filters, table, modal structure)
  2. [completed] Fix supplier_ordering_api.py database imports (use execute_query instead of get_db)
  3. [in_progress] Test API endpoints after fixing imports
  4. [pending] Test end-to-end workflow (generate, edit, lock, export)

  Key Technical Details

  Database Connection Pattern (CORRECT)

  from backend.database import execute_query

  # For single row:
  result = execute_query(query, (param1, param2), fetch_one=True, fetch_all=False)

  # For multiple rows:
  results = execute_query(query, (param1, param2), fetch_one=False, fetch_all=True)

  # For INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE:
  execute_query(query, (param1, param2), fetch_one=False, fetch_all=False)

  Query Parameter Format (CORRECT)

  # Use %s placeholders
  query = "SELECT * FROM table WHERE id = %s AND name = %s"
  params = (123, "test")  # Tuple, not dict

  # NOT this:
  query = "SELECT * FROM table WHERE id = :id AND name = :name"  # WRONG
  params = {"id": 123, "name": "test"}  # WRONG

  Column Names (CORRECT)

  - Use s.cost_per_unit NOT s.unit_cost
  - Table: skus, Column: cost_per_unit

  Files Modified

  1. backend/supplier_ordering_api.py - 518 lines, completely refactored
  2. backend/supplier_ordering_queries.py - 160 lines, removed SQLAlchemy, fixed column names
  3. No frontend changes needed - the issue was entirely backend

  Server Information

  - Running on: http://localhost:8000
  - Test Page: http://localhost:8000/static/supplier-ordering.html
  - Background Bash ID: cb0619 (may have multiple old IDs: e65a05, da4779, 179282)

  Next Immediate Steps

  1. Check server reload status
  2. Refresh browser page
  3. Check console for errors
  4. If API works: Begin systematic Playwright testing
  5. If API fails: Check server logs for specific error and fix

  Known Good State

  - Server loads supplier ordering API module successfully
  - Page structure renders correctly
  - Issue is database query execution, which should now be fixed pending server reload
