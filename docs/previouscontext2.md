  What Was Completed

  V8.0 Forecast Learning & Accuracy System - Phase 2 (TASK-532 to TASK-538)

  Status: ALL COMPLETED ✓ - Production Ready

  Context: Building a self-improving forecasting system that tracks prediction accuracy, compares to actual sales, and will        
  eventually learn from errors to improve future forecasts.

  Phase 2 Deliverables (All Complete)

  1. TASK-532: Scheduler Script

  File: backend/run_monthly_accuracy_update.py (95 lines)
  - Standalone script for manual or scheduled accuracy updates
  - Can be run: python backend/run_monthly_accuracy_update.py [--month YYYY-MM]
  - Dual logging (console + file)
  - Optional Windows Task Scheduler / cron automation

  2. TASK-533: API Endpoint

  File: backend/forecasting_api.py (lines 776-848)
  - Endpoint: POST /api/forecasts/accuracy/update?target_month=YYYY-MM
  - Enables UI-based manual triggering (no scheduler needed)
  - Returns: total_forecasts, actuals_found, avg_mape, stockout_affected_count

  3. TASK-535: End-to-End Test Script

  File: backend/test_accuracy_update.py (258 lines)
  - Tests before/after database states
  - Validates delta calculations
  - Displays sample accurate/inaccurate forecasts
  - Fixed Issues: MySQL reserved word year_month (requires backticks), Unicode encoding for Windows console

  4. TASK-536: MAPE Verification with Stockout Logic

  File: backend/test_mape_stockout_logic.py (556 lines)
  - Tests 3 scenarios:
    - Case 1: No stockout → MAPE=11.11%, included in avg
    - Case 2: Stockout + undersales → MAPE=66.67%, excluded from avg
    - Case 3: Stockout + oversales → MAPE=16.67%, included in avg
  - CRITICAL BUG FOUND & FIXED: backend/forecast_accuracy.py lines 431-471
    - Bug: Parameter mismatch in execute_query call (5 placeholders but 6 parameters passed)
    - Fix: Split into two branches with correct parameter counts

  5. TASK-537: Performance Testing

  File: backend/test_performance_accuracy.py (570 lines)
  - Tested: 1,765 SKUs (99.8% of 1,768 target)
  - Result: 4.76 seconds (12.6x faster than 60s target)
  - Time per SKU: 2.70ms
  - Projected capacity: 22,000+ SKUs within 60s window

  File: docs/PERFORMANCE_ANALYSIS_V8.md (450 lines)
  - Detailed performance analysis
  - Important Finding: idx_period_recorded composite index already exists in database
    - EXPLAIN showed table scan during testing because table was empty
    - Verified with actual data: index is used correctly (type: ref, key: idx_period_recorded)
    - Location: database/schema.sql line 104

  6. TASK-538: Documentation

  Updated Files:
  - docs/PERFORMANCE_ANALYSIS_V8.md - Corrected index status (already exists, functioning)
  - docs/TASKS.md - Marked TASK-535 to TASK-538 complete, added Phase 2 completion summary

  System Architecture Summary

  Database Tables

  1. forecast_accuracy - Stores predictions for later comparison
    - Columns: sku_id, warehouse, predicted_demand, actual_demand, absolute_percentage_error, stockout_affected,
  is_actual_recorded
    - Index: idx_period_recorded (forecast_period_start, is_actual_recorded) ✓ EXISTS
  2. monthly_sales - Actual sales data with corrected_demand columns (stockout-adjusted)
  3. stockout_dates - Tracks stockout days per SKU/warehouse

  Key Logic: Stockout-Aware MAPE

  Critical Business Rule:
  - If stockout_affected = TRUE AND actual < predicted → EXCLUDE from avg_mape calculation
    - Reason: Low sales due to supply failure, not forecast error
  - If stockout_affected = TRUE AND actual > predicted → INCLUDE in avg_mape calculation
    - Reason: We under-forecasted true demand (forecast error)

  Implementation: backend/forecast_accuracy.py function update_monthly_accuracy()

  What Still Needs to Be Done

  Phase 3: Multi-Dimensional Learning (TASK-539 to TASK-555)

  Status: NOT STARTED

  Objective: Implement intelligent learning algorithms that auto-adjust forecasting parameters based on accuracy patterns.

  Key Tasks:
  1. TASK-539 to TASK-541: Create backend/forecast_learning.py module
    - ForecastLearningEngine class
    - ABC/XYZ-specific learning rates (AX: 0.02 careful, CZ: 0.10 aggressive)
  2. TASK-542 to TASK-544: Growth adjustment learning
    - Analyze forecast bias patterns
    - Auto-adjust growth rates based on accuracy
    - Growth status awareness (viral/declining/normal)
  3. TASK-545 to TASK-547: Seasonal factor learning
    - Identify systematic seasonal errors
    - Auto-tune seasonal factors
    - Category-level fallback for new SKUs
  4. TASK-548 to TASK-550: Method effectiveness learning
    - Track which forecasting methods work best per SKU type
    - Auto-switch to better-performing methods
  5. TASK-551 to TASK-555: Testing, integration, documentation

  Estimated Effort: 10-12 hours

  Known Issues / Important Notes

  FIXED Issues (No Action Needed)

  1. ✅ MySQL reserved word: year_month requires backticks in queries
  2. ✅ Parameter mismatch bug in forecast_accuracy.py (lines 431-471) - FIXED
  3. ✅ Unicode encoding issues on Windows console - FIXED (removed emoji symbols)

  Performance Notes

  - System handles 1,765 SKUs in 4.76s (excellent)
  - Linear scaling: 2.70ms per SKU
  - No optimizations needed unless processing 10,000+ SKUs regularly
  - If needed: Batch stockout checks (N+1 query pattern is primary bottleneck)

  Production Readiness

  STATUS: READY FOR DEPLOYMENT ✓
  - All Phase 2 tasks complete
  - Performance validated
  - Database optimized (indexes exist)
  - Comprehensive testing done
  - No blocking issues

  Start TASK-539: Create backend/forecast_learning.py module

  Option 2: Deploy Phase 2 First

  1. Run accuracy update on real forecast/sales data
  2. Validate MAPE calculations with production data
  3. Monitor performance with full dataset
  4. Then proceed to Phase 3
