  What Was Completed

  TASK-381: Supplier Lead Time Management API

  Just completed implementation of supplier lead time management API endpoints.

  Files Created/Modified:

  1. backend/supplier_management_api.py (347 lines)
    - Created new API module with 3 endpoints under /api/suppliers
    - PUT /api/suppliers/{supplier}/lead-time - Updates P95 lead time for all SKUs from a supplier
    - GET /api/suppliers/{supplier}/lead-time-history - Returns historical statistics with optional seasonal/trend analysis
    - GET /api/suppliers/{supplier}/performance-alerts - Detects performance degradation alerts
  2. backend/main.py (lines 119-127)
    - Registered supplier_management_api router
    - Added try/except block for graceful error handling
  3. database/migrations/add_supplier_lead_time_history.sql (new migration)
    - Created audit trail table for tracking lead time changes
    - Fields: id, supplier, old_p95_lead_time, new_p95_lead_time, updated_by, notes, updated_at
    - Indexes: PRIMARY on id, composite on (supplier, updated_at), single on updated_at
    - Successfully executed migration and verified table exists

  Key Implementation Details:

  Cascade Update Logic:
  - When supplier lead time is updated via PUT endpoint, it updates:
    a. supplier_lead_times table (main cache)
    b. ALL supplier_order_confirmations records for that supplier WHERE lead_time_days_override IS NULL
    c. Preserves user-defined overrides (doesn't touch records with manual lead_time_days_override)
    d. Logs change to supplier_lead_time_history for audit trail

  Integration with Analytics:
  - Uses existing SupplierAnalytics class from supplier_analytics.py (980 lines, untouched)
  - Analytics provides: statistical metrics, reliability scoring, seasonal patterns, performance trends
  - Optional parameters: include_seasonal and include_trends for deeper analysis

  Pydantic Models:
  - UpdateLeadTimeRequest - Validates P95 input (1-365 days), requires username
  - UpdateLeadTimeResponse - Returns affected SKU/order counts
  - LeadTimeHistoryResponse - Comprehensive statistics response

    - backend/supplier_ordering_queries.py (164 lines) - SQL query builders
  - 6 endpoints under /api/supplier-orders:
    - POST /generate - Generate monthly recommendations
    - GET /{order_month} - Paginated list with filters
    - PUT /{order_id} - Update order quantities/overrides
    - POST /{order_id}/lock - Lock order from editing
    - POST /{order_id}/unlock - Unlock order
    - GET /{order_month}/summary - Statistics summary

  Current Status

  All backend API work for V9.0 Phase 1-3 is COMPLETE.

  No dependencies needed in requirements.txt (all using fastapi, sqlalchemy, pydantic which already exist).

  What Still Needs to Be Done (V9.0 Remaining Tasks)

  TASK-382: Build supplier ordering frontend page (supplier-ordering.html)

  Estimated: 2 hours

  Create main UI page with:
  - DataTables for paginated order list
  - Filter controls (warehouse, supplier, urgency, search)
  - Summary cards showing totals by urgency level
  - Month selector for viewing different order periods
  - Buttons: Generate Recommendations, Export to Excel
  - Integration with existing navbar (add link in all pages)

  Reference existing pages:
  - frontend/transfer-planning.html - DataTables pattern
  - frontend/sku-listing.html - Filter controls pattern
  - frontend/index.html - Summary cards pattern

  TASK-383: Implement JavaScript logic (supplier-ordering.js)

  Estimated: 2 hours

  Create JS module with:
  - API calls to all 6 endpoints from supplier_ordering_api.py
  - Inline editing for confirmed_qty, lead_time_days_override, notes
  - Lock/unlock workflow with username prompt
  - Real-time recalculation of order values
  - Filter state management
  - Export button handler
  - Error handling and user feedback

  Pattern to follow: frontend/js/transfer-planning.js for DataTables + API integration

  TASK-384: Enhanced SKU details modal

  Estimated: 1 hour

  Create modal showing:
  - Current inventory position
  - Pending orders timeline (visual timeline with confidence indicators)
  - 12-month forecast chart (from forecast_details table)
  - Order history for this SKU
  - Trigger: Click on SKU ID in main table

  Dependencies:
  - Chart.js (already in project)
  - Bootstrap modal (already in project)

  TASK-385: Monthly recommendations background job

  Estimated: 30 minutes

  Add scheduler to auto-generate recommendations:
  - Create backend/scheduler.py using APScheduler
  - Schedule job for 1st of each month at 6 AM
  - Calls generate_monthly_recommendations() for current month
  - Logs results
  - Register scheduler in main.py startup event

  TASK-386: Enhance pending order import

  Estimated: 1 hour

  Update backend/import_export.py pending orders import:
  - Currently overwrites supplier estimates with statistical P95

  - Update pending_orders table schema if needed

  TASK-387: Excel export with grouped supplier data

  Estimated: 2 hours

  Create export endpoint:
  - Group orders by supplier

  Estimated: 4 hours

  Create tests/supplier_ordering_test.py:
  - Test recommendation generation (accuracy of calculations)
  - Test pagination and filtering
  - Test inline editing workflow
  - Test lock/unlock functionality
  - Test performance with 4000+ SKUs
  - Visual regression tests for UI

  MUST use Playwright MCP tools as per CLAUDE.md instructions

  - Overview of monthly ordering process
  - How to generate recommendations
  - Understanding urgency levels
  - Editing quantities and lead times
  - Locking confirmed orders
  - Exporting to Excel
  - Troubleshooting common issues

  TASK-390: API documentation

  Estimated: 30 minutes

  Update docs/API.md or create docs/SUPPLIER_ORDERING_API.md:
  - Document all 6 supplier_ordering_api endpoints
  - Document 3 supplier_management_api endpoints
  - Request/response examples
  - Error codes and handling
  - FastAPI auto-generates OpenAPI docs at /api/docs (already working)

  Important Notes

  File Size Best Practices

  - Maximum 500 lines per file (warning at 400+)
  - TASK-380 was initially 606 lines, refactored into 3 files
  - Always check file size before completing tasks

  Database Tables Created

  1. supplier_order_confirmations (main ordering table)
  2. supplier_lead_time_history (audit trail)

  Existing Tables Used

  1. supplier_lead_times (cache table for analytics)
  2. supplier_shipments (historical data)
  3. skus (inventory master data)
  4. forecast_details (12-month forecasts)
  5. pending_orders (inbound inventory)

  Frontend Access

  - Development server: http://localhost:8000
  - Use run_dev.bat to start server (never manual uvicorn)
  - Static files at /static/ route

  No Emojis Policy

  Per CLAUDE.md: "DO NOT CODE WITH EMOJIS!" - Enforce in all files

  Ready to Continue

  Next task should be TASK-382: Build supplier ordering frontend page (supplier-ordering.html)

  Total remaining: ~15 hours across 9 tasks (382-390)
