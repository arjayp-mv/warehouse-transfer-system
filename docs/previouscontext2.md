  Current Problem

  Issue: UB-YTX14-BS forecasts are too low (657-1,352 units vs last year's 1,575-2,815 units) after implementing a new SKU methodology.

  Root Cause: The new SKU detection logic (checking if SKU has < 12 months of data) was added to backend/forecasting.py, but Python is NOT loading the updated code. The     
  old cached module is still being used despite multiple server restarts.

  What Was Attempted

  1. Initial Problem (Combined Test 6)

  - UB-YTX14-BS (established SKU with 69 months of data) was getting low forecasts
  - Investigation revealed: The code was checking if len(results) < 6 AFTER applying a LIMIT based on method_config['months']
  - For AY/BY/CY/BZ/CZ classifications (which use 3 months), this incorrectly triggered the "new SKU" methodology even for established SKUs

  2. The Fix Applied (lines 425-436 in backend/forecasting.py)

  # First check if this is a new SKU (< 12 months of data in database)
  data_check_query = """
      SELECT COUNT(*) as total_months
      FROM monthly_sales
      WHERE sku_id = %s
  """
  data_check_result = execute_query(data_check_query, (sku_id,), fetch_all=True)
  total_months_available = data_check_result[0]['total_months'] if data_check_result else 0

  # If new SKU (< 12 months of data), use limited data methodology
  if total_months_available < 12:
      return self._handle_limited_data_sku(sku_id, warehouse, sku_info, total_months_available)

  Also removed the old check at line 476-478:
  # OLD CODE (DELETED):
  # if len(results) < 6:
  #     return self._handle_limited_data_sku(sku_id, warehouse, sku_info, len(results))

  3. Testing Results

  - UB-YTX7A-BS (9 months of data) - Should use limited data methodology
    - Expected: Different method than simple_ma_3mo
    - ACTUAL: Still showing simple_ma_3mo with base_demand=19.63 across Tests 26, 27, 28, 29
  - Confirmed with test script (test_forecasting_logic.py):
    - Running engine._get_base_demand() directly returns 19.63
    - This proves the OLD code is still executing

  4. Python Caching Issue

  Despite multiple attempts:
  - Restarted uvicorn server 3+ times
  - Killed all Python processes
  - Tried clearing cache with del /S /Q __pycache__ (failed due to bash vs Windows commands)
  - The backend/forecasting.py module is NOT reloading

  Secondary Issue Discovered

  The fix also introduced a new bug: Some established SKUs are failing with:
  StatisticsError: mean requires at least one data point

  Cause: At line 484, for established SKUs, the query filters corrected_demand > 0, but some SKUs have all zeros in recent months, causing empty demands list.

  Affected SKUs (from Test 29 logs): ACA-10159, ACA-10165, ACF-10132, etc. (16+ failures in batch 6 alone)

  Files Modified

  backend/forecasting.py

  - Lines 425-436: Added new SKU detection logic (counts total months in monthly_sales)
  - Lines 476-478: Removed old faulty check (if len(results) < 6)
  - Status: Code changes are in the file but NOT being executed

  What Needs to Be Done

  IMMEDIATE (Critical)

  1. Force Python Module Reload
    - Option A: Find and delete ALL .pyc files in Windows: for /r %i in (*.pyc) do del "%i"
    - Option B: Add a unique comment or print statement to _get_base_demand() to verify it's loading new code
    - Option C: Restart computer to clear all Python processes and caches
    - Option D: Use a different approach that doesn't rely on uvicorn's auto-reload
  2. Verify Fix is Working
    - Run test_forecasting_logic.py again after cache clear
    - Expected: base_demand should be different from 19.63 for UB-YTX7A-BS
    - Create "Combined Test 10" and check:
        - UB-YTX7A-BS should use limited data method
      - UB-YTX14-BS should use weighted_ma_3mo and show higher quantities

  SECONDARY (Fix the New Bug)

  3. Handle Empty Demands List (line 478 area)
  demands = [float(row['total_demand']) for row in results]

  # Add check for empty list
  if not demands:
      # Fallback: either use limited data methodology or return 0
      return self._handle_limited_data_sku(sku_id, warehouse, sku_info, 0)

  # Apply forecasting method
  if method_config['method'] == 'weighted':
      return self._weighted_moving_average(demands, method_config['recent_weight'])
  else:
      return statistics.mean(demands)

  Key Data Points

  UB-YTX7A-BS (New SKU)

  - Total months in DB: 9
  - Months with sales: 7 (Mar-Sep 2025)
  - Pattern: 0, 0, 24, 133, 100, 1, 38, 14, 31 units
  - Classification: BZ
  - Should use: Limited data methodology (< 12 months)
  - Currently using: simple_ma_3mo with base_demand=19.63 ❌

  UB-YTX14-BS (Established SKU)

  - Total months in DB: 69
  - Classification: AY (uses 3 months for forecasting)
  - Should use: Weighted moving average
  - Current forecasts: 657-1,352 units (too low)
  - Last year actuals: 1,575-2,815 units

  Server Status

  Current Server: Background Bash e22185 running at http://localhost:8000
  - Started at 03:59:52 (2025-10-20)
  - Running with uvicorn backend.main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
  - Has the OLD cached backend/forecasting.py module loaded

  Test Files Created (Can be deleted)

  - check_ytx7a.py
  - check_sku_classification.py
  - check_death_row_sku.py
  - debug_ytx7a.py
  - test_forecasting_logic.py

  Todo List State

  1. ✅ Remove debug logging
  2. ✅ Clean up test files
  3. ✅ Fix indentation bug
  4. ✅ Fix new SKU detection logic (CODE WRITTEN, NOT LOADED)
  5. ⏳ Test Combined Test with corrected logic (BLOCKED by cache issue)
  6. ⏳ Database Integration (Phase 3)
  7. ⏳ Queue Management (Phase 4)

  Recommendation

  Start here:
  1. Verify the code changes are actually in backend/forecasting.py lines 425-436
  2. Use Windows PowerShell to aggressively clear Python cache: Get-ChildItem -Path . -Include __pycache__,*.pyc -Recurse -Force | Remove-Item -Force -Recurse
  3. Kill ALL Python processes
  4. Restart uvicorn server
  5. Run test_forecasting_logic.py to confirm new code is loaded
  6. Only then run "Combined Test 10"
