● V7.2.1 Forecasting System - Detailed Summary

  What Was Completed Successfully

  1. Month Calculation Bug Fix ✅

  Problem: Seasonal patterns were shifted by 1 month (Feb showing higher than Mar for UB-YTX14-BS motorcycle battery)

  Root Cause: forecasting.py line 269 used timedelta(days=30 * month_offset) which causes cumulative drift because months have different days (28/29/30/31)

  Fix Applied: Changed to relativedelta(months=month_offset) for accurate calendar month arithmetic

  File: backend/forecasting.py line 269

  ---
  2. Historical Comparison Feature ✅

  Requirement: User wanted to see last year's actual data alongside forecast in the monthly details modal

  What Was Implemented:
  1. New API Endpoint: backend/forecasting_api.py lines 535-618
    - Endpoint: GET /api/forecasts/runs/{run_id}/historical/{sku_id}
    - Fetches last 12 months of historical sales data
    - Returns JSON with months, quantities, and revenues arrays
  2. Enhanced Frontend Modal: frontend/forecasting.js lines 511-637
    - Made showMonthlyDetails() async
    - Fetches historical data when modal opens
    - Shows loading indicator during fetch
    - Displays side-by-side comparison in monthly grid
    - Chart shows TWO lines: orange dashed (historical) + blue solid (forecast)

  Status: COMPLETE and working

  Critical Issue Still Being Fixed

  Database Connection Pool Race Condition ⚠️

  Problem:
  - Run #11 "Burnaby Test" stuck at "pending" with 0% progress
  - Logs show errors trying to insert forecast_details for non-existent run_id=7159
  - Actual run in database has id=11, but code tried to use 7159

  Root Cause Identified:
  The create_forecast_run() function in forecasting.py (lines 353-374 BEFORE the fix) used TWO separate database connections:
  # OLD BUGGY CODE:
  execute_query(INSERT...)  # Connection A
  result = execute_query('SELECT LAST_INSERT_ID()')  # Connection B (WRONG!)

  When using connection pooling, SELECT LAST_INSERT_ID() goes to a different connection that didn't perform the INSERT, returning a stale/wrong value (7159 instead of      
  11).

  Fix Applied: backend/forecasting.py lines 353-382
  # NEW FIXED CODE:
  def create_forecast_run(forecast_name: str, growth_assumption: float = 0.0) -> int:
      import pymysql
      from .database import get_connection

      connection = get_connection()  # Single connection for both queries
      try:
          with connection.cursor() as cursor:
              query = """
                  INSERT INTO forecast_runs
                  (forecast_name, forecast_date, status, growth_assumption, created_by)
                  VALUES (%s, CURDATE(), 'pending', %s, 'system')
              """
              cursor.execute(query, (forecast_name, growth_assumption))
              connection.commit()

              return cursor.lastrowid  # Get ID from SAME connection
      finally:
          connection.close()

  Database Cleanup Done:
  - Marked run #11 as 'failed' with error message explaining the race condition

  What Needs Testing

  Test the Database Fix:

  1. Generate a new forecast (any warehouse, any filters)
  2. Verify it doesn't get stuck at "pending"
  3. Check that it progresses to "running" then "completed"
  4. Confirm no foreign key constraint errors in server logs

  Test the V7.2.1 Fixes:

  1. Month Labeling Test:
    - Open a completed forecast (Run #9 or #10 work)
    - Search for "UB-YTX14-BS"
    - Verify Feb 2026 is LOWER than Mar 2026 (not backwards anymore)
    - Feb should be ~1,200-1,400 units
    - Mar should be ~2,000-2,200 units
  2. Historical Comparison Test:
    - Click "Details" button on any SKU
    - Should see chart with TWO lines (orange dashed + blue solid)
    - Monthly grid should show both forecast AND last year's actual data
    - Example: "Oct 2025: 1,800 | Oct 2024: 1,575"

  Files Modified

  1. backend/forecasting.py
    - Line 269: Fixed month calculation (timedelta → relativedelta)
    - Lines 353-382: Fixed create_forecast_run() race condition
  2. backend/forecasting_api.py
    - Lines 535-618: New historical data endpoint
  3. frontend/forecasting.js
    - Lines 511-637: Enhanced showMonthlyDetails() with historical comparison

  Server Status

  - Server is running on http://localhost:8000
  - Two background bash processes (7ff8b6 and e88092) - one should be killed
  - Server auto-reloaded after forecasting.py fix
  - Ready for testing

  ---
  Next Steps

  1. Kill duplicate server process (keep only one uvicorn instance)
  2. Generate new test forecast to verify database fix works
  3. If forecast completes successfully, all V7.2.1 fixes are done
  4. If it still fails, may need to check if server actually reloaded the fixed code

  Key Technical Details

  - Historical data query: Last 12 months ending at latest sales month (Sep 2025)
  - Forecast period: Oct 2025 - Sep 2026 (12 months from latest+1)
  - Chart colors: Orange dashed = historical, Blue solid = forecast
  - Fix prevents: Foreign key constraint errors due to wrong run_id being used
