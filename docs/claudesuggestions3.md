Excellent point! The **monthly ordering cycle** is a critical constraint that significantly changes the calculations. Let me revise the entire approach to account for your once-per-month ordering process.

## ðŸ“… **Monthly Ordering Constraint Impact**

### **1. Fixed Review Period = 30 Days**

This fundamentally changes the reorder point formula. From the Inventory Management Expert knowledge base:

> "if you have more than six months [lead time] every months... you don't want to receive one product every day"

Your current constraint means:

```python
def calculate_order_for_monthly_cycle(sku_id, warehouse, supplier):
    """
    Calculation specifically for monthly ordering cycle.
    Reference: Inventory Management Expert - fixed period ordering
    """
    
    # CRITICAL: Review period is FIXED at 30 days
    REVIEW_PERIOD = 30  # You only order once per month
    
    # When is the next ordering opportunity?
    days_until_next_order = calculate_days_to_next_order_date()
    
    # Key question: Will we have enough until AFTER the next order arrives?
    # Next order placed in: days_until_next_order
    # That order arrives in: days_until_next_order + lead_time
    # Total coverage needed: days_until_next_order + lead_time + REVIEW_PERIOD
```

### **2. Revised Reorder Point Formula for Monthly Ordering**

The knowledge base states for fixed period ordering (your case):

```python
def calculate_monthly_reorder_point(sku_id, warehouse, supplier):
    """
    Reorder point for monthly ordering schedule.
    Must cover: Time to next order + Lead time + Full month until following order
    """
    
    # Get lead time stats
    lead_time_data = get_dynamic_lead_time(supplier, warehouse)
    lead_time_days = lead_time_data['p95_lead_time']  # Use P95 for safety
    
    # Critical: Calculate total coverage period needed
    # We need stock to last until the NEXT order after this one arrives
    total_coverage_days = lead_time_days + REVIEW_PERIOD
    
    # But also consider: When are we placing this order?
    if calculating_mid_month:
        # If calculating mid-month, add days until month-end
        days_to_month_end = 30 - current_day_of_month
        total_coverage_days += days_to_month_end
    
    # Get corrected demand
    daily_demand = get_corrected_demand(sku_id, warehouse) / 30
    
    # Demand during total period
    demand_during_period = daily_demand * total_coverage_days
    
    # Safety stock must account for the long review period
    safety_stock = calculate_safety_stock_monthly(
        sku_id, 
        daily_demand,
        lead_time_days,
        REVIEW_PERIOD  # This is key - 30 days vs daily/weekly
    )
    
    return demand_during_period + safety_stock
```

### **3. Enhanced Safety Stock for Monthly Ordering**

The monthly constraint significantly increases safety stock needs:

```python
def calculate_safety_stock_monthly(sku_id, daily_demand, lead_time_days, review_period=30):
    """
    Safety stock calculation accounting for monthly review period.
    Reference: Knowledge base - "the review period adds to uncertainty"
    """
    
    # Get SKU characteristics
    sku_data = get_sku_characteristics(sku_id)
    
    # Monthly ordering increases uncertainty
    total_period = lead_time_days + review_period
    
    # Standard deviation increases with square root of time
    demand_std_daily = daily_demand * sku_data['coefficient_variation']
    demand_std_period = demand_std_daily * sqrt(total_period)
    
    # Service level by ABC-XYZ
    z_score = get_service_level_z_score(sku_data['abc_code'], sku_data['xyz_code'])
    
    # Calculate safety stock
    safety_stock = z_score * demand_std_period
    
    # CRITICAL: Add extra buffer for monthly ordering
    # From knowledge base: "if you only place one order every week you need to add this extra week"
    # For monthly, this is even more critical
    monthly_buffer = daily_demand * 7  # Extra week buffer for monthly ordering
    
    if sku_data['abc_code'] == 'A':
        safety_stock += monthly_buffer  # Critical items need extra buffer
    elif sku_data['abc_code'] == 'B' and sku_data['xyz_code'] in ['Y', 'Z']:
        safety_stock += monthly_buffer * 0.5  # Moderate buffer for variable items
    
    return round(safety_stock)
```

### **4. Monthly Order Timing Decision Logic**

When should you actually place the order within the month?

```python
def determine_monthly_order_timing(sku_id, warehouse, supplier):
    """
    Decide if SKU needs ordering this month and how much.
    Accounts for monthly constraint.
    """
    
    # Current position
    current_stock = get_current_inventory(sku_id, warehouse)
    effective_pending = calculate_effective_pending_inventory(sku_id, warehouse, supplier)
    current_position = current_stock + effective_pending
    
    # Get demand and lead time
    daily_demand = get_corrected_demand(sku_id, warehouse) / 30
    lead_time_data = get_dynamic_lead_time(supplier, warehouse)
    
    # Key calculation: Do we have enough to last until next month's order arrives?
    # If we order today: arrives in lead_time days
    # If we skip and order next month: arrives in 30 + lead_time days
    
    days_of_coverage = current_position / daily_demand
    
    # Critical decision point
    if days_of_coverage < lead_time_data['p95_lead_time'] + 30:
        # MUST ORDER THIS MONTH - won't last until next month's order arrives
        order_decision = 'MUST_ORDER'
        urgency = 'HIGH'
        
    elif days_of_coverage < lead_time_data['p95_lead_time'] + 60:
        # SHOULD ORDER THIS MONTH - cutting it close
        order_decision = 'SHOULD_ORDER'
        urgency = 'MEDIUM'
        
    elif days_of_coverage < lead_time_data['p95_lead_time'] + 90:
        # OPTIONAL ORDER - could wait but safer to order
        order_decision = 'OPTIONAL_ORDER'
        urgency = 'LOW'
        
    else:
        # SKIP THIS MONTH - plenty of stock
        order_decision = 'SKIP'
        urgency = 'NONE'
    
    # Calculate order quantity if ordering
    if order_decision != 'SKIP':
        # Target: Have enough to last through next month's cycle
        target_coverage_days = lead_time_data['p95_lead_time'] + 60  # Lead time + 2 months
        target_inventory = daily_demand * target_coverage_days
        
        # Add safety stock
        safety_stock = calculate_safety_stock_monthly(
            sku_id, daily_demand, lead_time_data['p95_lead_time']
        )
        
        target_inventory += safety_stock
        
        # Order quantity
        order_qty = max(0, target_inventory - current_position)
        
        # Round to multiples
        order_qty = round_to_multiple(sku_id, order_qty)
    else:
        order_qty = 0
    
    return {
        'decision': order_decision,
        'urgency': urgency,
        'order_qty': order_qty,
        'days_of_coverage': days_of_coverage,
        'next_order_opportunity': '30 days',
        'risk_assessment': assess_stockout_risk(days_of_coverage, daily_demand)
    }
```

### **5. Complete Monthly Ordering Workflow**

Here's the full process for your monthly ordering:

```python
def monthly_supplier_ordering_process(order_date=None):
    """
    Complete monthly ordering process.
    Reference: Knowledge base - "fixed period ordering"
    """
    
    if not order_date:
        order_date = get_monthly_order_date()  # e.g., 15th of each month
    
    results = {
        'must_order': [],      # Critical - will run out before next opportunity
        'should_order': [],    # Recommended - risky to wait
        'optional_order': [],  # Nice to have - can wait if needed
        'skip': []            # Don't order - sufficient stock
    }
    
    # Process all SKUs
    all_skus = get_active_skus()
    
    for sku in all_skus:
        for warehouse in ['burnaby', 'kentucky']:
            # Get supplier for this SKU
            supplier = get_sku_supplier(sku['sku_id'])
            
            # Determine ordering need
            order_analysis = determine_monthly_order_timing(
                sku['sku_id'], 
                warehouse, 
                supplier
            )
            
            # Special handling for different scenarios
            if sku['status'] == 'Death Row':
                # Override to reduce orders for discontinued items
                if order_analysis['decision'] != 'MUST_ORDER':
                    order_analysis['decision'] = 'SKIP'
                    order_analysis['order_qty'] = 0
            
            elif sku['abc_code'] == 'A' and order_analysis['decision'] == 'OPTIONAL_ORDER':
                # Upgrade to SHOULD_ORDER for critical A items
                order_analysis['decision'] = 'SHOULD_ORDER'
            
            # Add to appropriate list
            if order_analysis['order_qty'] > 0:
                results[order_analysis['decision'].lower()].append({
                    'sku_id': sku['sku_id'],
                    'warehouse': warehouse,
                    'supplier': supplier,

                })
    
    return results
```

### **6. Practical Example with Monthly Ordering**

Let's recalculate the UB-YTX14-BS battery with monthly constraints:

```
=== MONTHLY ORDERING ANALYSIS ===
SKU: UB-YTX14-BS (12V Battery)
Warehouse: Kentucky
Order Date: January 15th (next opportunity: February 15th)

CURRENT SITUATION:
- Current Stock: 12 units
- Daily Demand: 1.74 units (52.3/30)
- Lead Time: 60 days (P95)

PENDING ORDERS:
- Order #1: 50 units arriving in ~7 days (80% confidence) = 40 effective
- Order #2: 100 units arriving in 50 days (71% confidence) = 71 effective
- Order #3: 200 units arriving in 119 days (ignored - too far out)
- Effective Pending: 111 units

COVERAGE CALCULATION:
- Current Position: 12 + 111 = 123 units
- Days of Coverage: 123 Ã· 1.74 = 70.7 days
- Coverage until: March 26th

DECISION LOGIC:
If we ORDER THIS MONTH (January 15):
- Order arrives: January 15 + 60 days = March 16
- Must last until: April 15 (next order) + 60 days = June 14
- Total coverage needed: 150 days from today
- Required inventory: 1.74 Ã— 150 = 261 units

If we SKIP THIS MONTH:
- Next order: February 15
- That arrives: February 15 + 60 days = April 16
- Current coverage ends: March 26
- GAP: 21 days WITHOUT STOCK!

DECISION: MUST ORDER THIS MONTH

ORDER QUANTITY CALCULATION:
- Target inventory: 261 units (150 days coverage)
- Safety stock for monthly ordering: 
  * Base: 1.74 Ã— sqrt(90 days) Ã— 2.33 = 38 units
  * Monthly buffer (A-item): +12 units
  * Total safety stock: 50 units
- Target with safety: 311 units
- Current position: 123 units
- Order quantity: 311 - 123 = 188 units
- Rounded to 50s: 200 units

FINAL RECOMMENDATION:
âœ… ORDER 200 UNITS THIS MONTH (HIGH URGENCY)
```

LEFT JOIN supplier_lead_times slt ON s.supplier = slt.supplier
WHERE s.status = 'Active';
```

## ðŸŽ¯ **Key Adjustments for Monthly Ordering**

1. **Fixed Review Period** - Always 30 days, not optimized
2. **Longer Safety Stock** - Must cover monthly uncertainty
3. **Coverage Calculation** - Must last until order AFTER next arrives
4. **Urgency Levels** - Based on whether can wait until next month
5. **Batch Optimization** - Order multiple months worth when ordering
6. **Risk Assessment** - Higher risk due to less frequent ordering
7. **Death Row Items** - More conservative due to infrequent orders

## ðŸ“‹ **Monthly Ordering Best Practices from Knowledge Base**

The Inventory Management Expert specifically addresses this:

> "if you have more than three months [lead time] every two weeks and if you have more than six months every months"

Your 120-day (4-month) lead times align with monthly ordering, but require:

1. **Higher safety stocks** - The expert recommends adding the review period to calculations
2. **Better batching** - "optimize your container and your transport"  
3. **Exception handling** - "Urgent orders... for very strategic product"
4. **Supplier coordination** - "coordinate easily... global optimization"

This monthly constraint is why your **forecast accuracy** and **stockout tracking** are so critical - you have fewer chances to correct mistakes!
