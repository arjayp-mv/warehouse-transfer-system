  What Was Completed

  Task: User Guidance & Metric Clarity Improvements

  User had 3 main questions/concerns:

  1. "Why is Total Forecasts showing 294?" - Label was misleading
  2. "Will running accuracy update without real sales data corrupt metrics?" - YES
  3. "When should I check/uncheck the stockout filter?" - Needed guidance

  Implementation Completed (100% Done)

  File Modified: frontend/forecast-accuracy.html (~150 lines added/modified)

  Changes Made:

  1. Fixed Metric Label (Line 217)
    - FROM: "Total Forecasts"
    - TO: "Forecasts with Actuals"
    - Clarifies it counts completed accuracy checks (294), not total forecast records (63,648)
  2. Added 3 Bootstrap Tooltips (Lines 133-192)
    - Update Accuracy Button: Comprehensive tooltip explaining what it does, when to use (monthly after uploading sales), requirements
  (completed month only), and impact
    - Run Learning Analysis Button: Tooltip explaining prerequisites (2-3 months data), when to use (AFTER accuracy update), and what it        
  generates
    - Exclude Stockout Checkbox: Detailed tooltip explaining CHECKED (true forecast accuracy, use for algorithm evaluation) vs UNCHECKED        
  (business reality, use for business impact)
  3. Added Monthly Workflow Guide Card (Lines 214-290)
    - Collapsible card with 5-step monthly process
    - Step 1: Upload Sales Data (1st-2nd of month)
    - Step 2: Update Accuracy (after upload, select completed month)
    - Step 3: Review Dashboard (MAPE target <20%, check trends)
    - Step 4: Run Learning Analysis (needs 2-3 months data)
    - Step 5: Apply Adjustments (review recommendations table)
    - Warning: Never run with test data or future months
    - Time estimate: 15-30 minutes/month
  4. Initialized Bootstrap Tooltips (Lines 816-823)
    - Added JavaScript in DOMContentLoaded event
    - Properly initializes all tooltips with HTML support
  5. Added Smart Validation Warnings (Lines 740-761, 801-826)
    - triggerAccuracyUpdate(): Warns if user selects current/future month, explains corruption risk (100% MAPE, invalid learning data)
    - triggerLearningAnalysis(): Checks if completedForecasts < 100, warns about insufficient data for reliable recommendations

  Testing Completed (All Passed)

  ✅ All tooltips display correctly with proper content on hover✅ Monthly Workflow Guide expands/collapses on click✅ Metric label shows
  "Forecasts with Actuals"✅ Both action buttons function correctly✅ Screenshot saved:

  Critical Issue User Needs to Fix

  Corrupted Data in Database

  Problem: User ran "Update Accuracy" for October 2025 without real sales data, creating 294 forecast records with:
  - predicted_demand > 0
  - actual_demand = 0
  - absolute_percentage_error = 100.00%
  - is_actual_recorded = 1

  Impact:
  - Overall MAPE shows 99.66% (artificially inflated)
  - If learning analysis runs now, it will think all forecasts are terrible
  - Historical trends corrupted

  Solution SQL (user needs to run this):
  UPDATE forecast_accuracy
  SET is_actual_recorded = 0,
      actual_demand = NULL,
      absolute_error = NULL,
      percentage_error = NULL,
      absolute_percentage_error = NULL
  WHERE forecast_period_start = '2025-10-01'
    AND forecast_period_end = '2025-10-31'
    AND is_actual_recorded = 1;

  This resets the 294 bad records back to "waiting for actuals" status.

  Database State

  - Total forecast_accuracy records: 63,648
  - Records waiting for actuals: 63,354 (is_actual_recorded=0)
  - Records with actuals (CORRUPTED): 294 (is_actual_recorded=1, all October 2025)
  - Unique SKUs: 1,768
  - Forecast runs: 3 (runs 48, 49, 50 from Oct 22, 2025)

  User's Next Steps (Tell Them)

  1. Clean corrupted data: Run the SQL UPDATE above
  2. Wait for real sales data: Don't run accuracy update until you have actual October sales in monthly_sales table
  3. When ready: Upload real sales, then run accuracy update for a COMPLETED month (e.g., September if you have Sep data)
  4. After 2-3 months: Run learning analysis when you have sufficient accuracy data (not now!)

  Key Learnings to Share with User

  When to Use Stockout Filter

  CHECKED (Exclude stockout-affected forecasts):
  - Shows "true forecast accuracy" - how good predictions were when supply wasn't constrained
  - Use for: Algorithm evaluation, learning analysis, method tuning, management reports on "forecast quality"
  - Excludes: Forecasts where stockout_affected=1 (supply constraint caused low sales)

  UNCHECKED (Include all forecasts):
  - Shows "business reality" - actual forecast vs actual sales regardless of stockouts
  - Use for: Business impact analysis, inventory planning assessment, financial impact calculations
  - Includes: All forecasts, even supply-constrained ones

  Monthly Workflow (Remind User)

  1. 1st-2nd of month: Upload previous month's sales to monthly_sales (include stockout days)
  2. After upload: Click "Update Accuracy" for COMPLETED month (not current/future)
  3. Review dashboard: Check MAPE (target <20%), trends, problem SKUs
  4. 2nd-3rd of month: Click "Run Learning Analysis" (only after 2-3 months of data)
  5. Apply adjustments: Review forecast_learning_adjustments table, apply growth rates

  No Remaining Tasks

  All V8.0.2 implementation is complete. User just needs to:
  - Fix corrupted data (SQL above)
  - Follow workflow guide going forward
  - Wait for real data before running operations

  Technical Notes for New Instance

  - Server running on port 8003 (not 8000)
  - Bootstrap 5 tooltips require initialization in DOMContentLoaded
  - Validation checks happen before API calls (client-side)
  - Database: MySQL via XAMPP, warehouse_transfer database
  - Current date context: October 22, 2025 (system date)
  - Project follows no-emoji policy in code
