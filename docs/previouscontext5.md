 What Was Being Worked On

  V9.0 Supplier Ordering System - SQLAlchemy to PyMySQL Migration

  Successfully refactored the supplier ordering system from SQLAlchemy Session pattern to the project's standard execute_query    
   pattern (PyMySQL with DictCursor).

  Work Completed - All Tasks ✅

  1. Core Database Refactoring (COMPLETED)

  All 5 functions in backend/supplier_ordering_calculations.py were refactored:
  - Changed from SQLAlchemy Session to execute_query()
  - Changed parameter format from :param_name to %s with tuple params
  - Removed db.commit() calls
  - Fixed result access from SQLAlchemy rows to dictionaries

  2. Database Schema Fixes (COMPLETED)

  Fixed 4 schema mismatches in backend/supplier_ordering_calculations.py:

  Line 88: Added NULL filter for expected_arrival
  AND expected_arrival IS NOT NULL

  Lines 260-263: Fixed composite key JOIN for sku_demand_stats
  LEFT JOIN sku_demand_stats sds ON s.sku_id = sds.sku_id AND sds.warehouse = %s
  Changed params from (sku_id,) to (warehouse, sku_id)

  Line 354: Added backticks around reserved keyword
  ORDER BY `year_month` DESC

  Line 371: Fixed column name
  WHERE supplier = %s AND destination = %s  # Changed from 'warehouse'

  3. Data Type Conversion (COMPLETED)

  Fixed in backend/supplier_ordering_api.py lines 181-194:
  from decimal import Decimal
  decimal_fields = ['coverage_months', 'cost_per_unit', 'suggested_value', 'confirmed_value']
  for field in decimal_fields:
      value = row.get(field)
      if value is not None:
          if isinstance(value, (Decimal, str)):
              row[field] = float(value)
  This fixed JavaScript .toFixed() errors.

  4. Connection Pooling (COMPLETED)

  Added to .env:
  USE_CONNECTION_POOLING=false

  5. JavaScript Bug Fix (COMPLETED)

  Fixed frontend/supplier-ordering.js line 124:
  // Changed from result.total_generated to:
  showSuccess(`Successfully generated ${result.recommendations_generated} recommendations`);

  6. Pagination Fix (COMPLETED - JUST FINISHED)

  Most Recent Work:

  File 1: backend/supplier_ordering_api.py line 106
  # Changed from:
  page_size: int = Query(50, ge=1, le=500)
  # To:
  page_size: int = Query(50, ge=1, le=5000)

  File 2: frontend/supplier-ordering.js lines 69-72
  const params = new URLSearchParams({
      order_month: currentOrderMonth,
      page_size: 5000  // Load all recommendations (supports up to 5K SKUs)
  });

  Current Status

  System is FULLY OPERATIONAL:
  - ✅ Generate Recommendations: Working (generated 2,126 recommendations)
  - ✅ Database queries: All converted to PyMySQL
  - ✅ Data display: Should now show all 2,126 entries (fix just applied)
  - ✅ Numeric fields: Properly formatted as floats
  - ✅ Success messages: Fixed field name mismatch

  What Still Needs Testing

  IMMEDIATE NEXT STEP:
  1. Refresh browser at http://localhost:8000/static/supplier-ordering.html
  2. Verify table shows "Showing 1 to 50 of 2126 entries" (not just "50 of 50")
  3. Test client-side pagination works (page through all ~43 pages)
  4. Verify filters work across all data (warehouse, supplier, urgency dropdowns)
  5. Check load time is acceptable (<2 seconds per CLAUDE.md)

  If the above test succeeds, then:
  - Mark pagination fix as complete
  - The V9.0 refactoring is 100% done

  Server Status

  - Server running on bash ID: 6b7a19
  - Last status: Reloading after supplier_ordering_api.py change
  - Command: python -m uvicorn backend.main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000

  Files Modified (Complete List)

  1. backend/supplier_ordering_calculations.py
    - Lines 88, 260-263, 354, 371
  2. backend/supplier_ordering_api.py
    - Lines 106 (pagination limit)
    - Lines 181-194 (Decimal conversion)
  3. frontend/supplier-ordering.js
    - Line 71 (page_size parameter)
    - Line 124 (success message field name)
  4. .env
    - Added USE_CONNECTION_POOLING=false

  Test Results So Far

  Database verification:
  SELECT COUNT(*), urgency_level FROM supplier_order_confirmations
  WHERE order_month = '2025-10' GROUP BY urgency_level;
  Results:
  - 109 Must Order (33,347 units)
  - 77 Should Order (7,772 units)
  - 49 Optional (137 units)
  - 1,891 Skip (0 units)
  - Total: 2,126 recommendations

  Known Good Patterns (For Reference)

  Database query pattern:
  from backend.database import execute_query

  # Single row:
  result = execute_query(query, (param1, param2), fetch_one=True, fetch_all=False)
  value = result.get('column_name')

  # Multiple rows:
  results = execute_query(query, (param1,), fetch_one=False, fetch_all=True) or []

  # INSERT/UPDATE:
  execute_query(query, (param1,), fetch_one=False, fetch_all=False)

  Key differences from SQLAlchemy:
  - Use %s placeholders (not :param_name)
  - Use tuple params (not dict)
  - No db.commit() needed
  - Results are dictionaries
  - Reserved keywords need backticks in MySQL
  - Composite keys need all columns in JOIN

  Decision Made: Pagination Approach

  Rejected complex solutions (server-side pagination, progressive rendering, etc.) per CLAUDE.md "Keep It Simple" philosophy.     

  Chosen solution: Client-side DataTables with all data loaded at once
  - Rationale: 2-4K SKUs is small dataset for modern browsers
  - DataTables handles filtering/sorting efficiently
  - Simple code, fast UX
  - Aligns with project philosophy

  That's everything! The system should be fully working once the browser refresh confirms all 2,126 records load correctly.
