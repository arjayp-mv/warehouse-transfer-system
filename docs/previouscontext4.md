  What Was Being Worked On

  Refactoring the V9.0 Supplier Ordering System's core calculation engine from SQLAlchemy Session pattern to the project's execute_query 
  pattern (PyMySQL with DictCursor).

  Context

  The previous session had already fixed:
  1. backend/supplier_ordering_api.py - All 7 API endpoints refactored
  2. backend/supplier_ordering_queries.py - Query builder functions refactored

  This session focused on fixing backend/supplier_ordering_calculations.py - the core calculation engine with 5 interdependent functions.

  Work Completed

  File: backend/supplier_ordering_calculations.py

  All 5 functions refactored:

  1. get_time_phased_pending_orders() (lines 49-114)
    - Removed db: Session parameter
    - Changed query from text() to plain string
    - Changed params from :param_name to %s
    - Changed from dict to tuple params
    - Used execute_query(query, (sku_id, warehouse), fetch_one=False, fetch_all=True)
  2. calculate_safety_stock_monthly() (lines 230-308)
    - Same refactoring pattern
  3. calculate_effective_pending_inventory() (lines 117-227)
    - Same refactoring pattern
    - Updated function call to remove db parameter
  4. determine_monthly_order_timing() (lines 305-435)
    - Same refactoring pattern
    - Fixed 3 queries with CASE statements (warehouse parameter used multiple times)
  5. generate_monthly_recommendations() (lines 438-566)
    - Most complex function
    - Removed db: Session parameter
    - Changed INSERT query with 19 parameters from dict to tuple
    - Changed ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE param = :param to VALUES(param) syntax
    - Removed db.commit() call
    - Added import json for pending_breakdown serialization

  Column Name Fixes Applied

  Three column name mismatches discovered and fixed:

  1. supplier_lead_times table (line 148):
    - Changed AND warehouse = %s → AND destination = %s
  2. pending_inventory table (line 77):
    - Removed non-existent supplier column from SELECT
    - Changed status filter from ('ordered', 'shipped', 'in_transit') → ('ordered', 'shipped')
    - (in_transit is not a valid enum value)
  3. monthly_sales table (line 354):
    - Changed ORDER BY month_start DESC → ORDER BY year_month DESC

  Current Status: STILL FAILING

  Last Error (from server logs):
  Unknown column 'month_start' in 'order clause'

  Status: The fix for #3 above was just applied (line 354), server is reloading but NOT YET TESTED.

  What Still Needs To Be Done

  Immediate Next Steps:

  1. Wait for server reload to complete
    - Server bash ID: d010ab
    - Check logs for "Application startup complete"
  2. Test the Generate Recommendations button again
    - Navigate to http://localhost:8000/static/supplier-ordering.html
    - Click "Generate Recommendations"
    - Accept confirmation dialog
    - Expected: Should work now (all 3 column fixes applied)
    - If fails: Check server logs for next column mismatch error
  3. If there are MORE column name errors:
    - Pattern: SQLAlchemy code was written with incorrect column names
    - Solution: Check actual table structure with:
    "C:\xampp\mysql\bin\mysql.exe" -u root warehouse_transfer -e "DESCRIBE table_name;"
    - Fix column names in queries
  4. Once Generate Recommendations succeeds:
    - Verify data appears in table
    - Test inline editing
    - Test lock/unlock functionality
    - Test Excel export
    - Mark todo #8 as completed
    - Start todo #9: end-to-end workflow testing

  Key Technical Details

  Database Connection Pattern (CORRECT):

  from backend.database import execute_query

  # Single row:
  result = execute_query(query, (param1, param2), fetch_one=True, fetch_all=False)
  value = result.get('column_name')  # Dictionary access

  # Multiple rows:
  results = execute_query(query, (param1,), fetch_one=False, fetch_all=True) or []

  # INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE:
  execute_query(query, (param1,), fetch_one=False, fetch_all=False)
  # No db.commit() needed - execute_query handles it

  Query Parameter Format (CORRECT):

  # Use %s placeholders
  query = "SELECT * FROM table WHERE id = %s AND name = %s"
  params = (123, "test")  # Tuple, not dict

  Column Name Corrections Made:

  - warehouse → destination (supplier_lead_times)
  - Remove supplier column (pending_inventory - doesn't exist)
  - month_start → year_month (monthly_sales)

  Files Modified

  1. backend/supplier_ordering_calculations.py
    - 574 lines total
    - ~140 lines modified
    - All 5 functions refactored
    - 7 database queries converted
    - 1 db.commit() removed
    - Import changes (removed SQLAlchemy, added json)

  Server Information

  - Current Server: Bash ID d010ab
  - Test URL: http://localhost:8000/static/supplier-ordering.html
  - Status: Reloading after last fix

  Todo List State

  1. [completed] Read supplier_ordering_calculations.py
  2. [completed] Identify all SQLAlchemy queries
  3. [completed] Refactor function signatures
  4. [completed] Convert queries to execute_query
  5. [completed] Change :param to %s format
  6. [completed] Update result access to dictionaries
  7. [completed] Remove db.commit() calls
  8. [in_progress] Test generate recommendations
  9. [pending] Verify end-to-end workflow

  Potential Remaining Issues

  Based on the pattern of column name mismatches, there MAY be more column name errors in queries that haven't been reached yet. The
  systematic approach:

  1. Let code fail
  2. Read error from logs
  3. Check actual table structure: DESCRIBE table_name
  4. Fix column name in query
  5. Test again

  This will continue until all column mismatches are resolved and Generate Recommendations succeeds.
