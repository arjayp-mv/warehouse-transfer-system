  What Was Just Completed (V7.2.4)

  Issue 1: CSC-R55 Details Button Fix ✅ FIXED

  Problem: Details button did nothing when clicked on CSC-R55 (and any SKU with special characters like quotes, apostrophes in description)

  Root Cause:
  - frontend/forecasting.js:738 used JSON.stringify(row) directly in HTML onclick attribute
  - When data contained quotes (e.g., "Premium" Series), it broke JavaScript parsing
  - Example broken HTML: onclick='showMonthlyDetails({"description":"Battery - "Premium" Series",...})'
  - Nested quotes broke the onclick attribute parser
  - No API call was made (JavaScript failed silently before reaching the API)

  Fix Applied:
  1. Modified frontend/forecasting.js:745-751:
    - Changed from inline JSON.stringify(row) to data-row-index="${meta.row}"
    - Button now stores simple row index instead of full JSON
  2. Added event delegation handler at frontend/forecasting.js:77-83:
  $('#forecastResultsTable tbody').on('click', 'button[data-row-index]', function() {
      const rowIndex = $(this).data('row-index');
      const rowData = forecastResultsTable.row(rowIndex).data();
      showMonthlyDetails(rowData);
  });

  Result: All SKUs now work, including those with special characters in descriptions

  Issue 2: UB-YTX14-BS "Under-Forecasting" Explanation ✅ DOCUMENTED

  User's Concern: Oct-Dec 2025 forecast appeared 24-36% lower than Oct-Dec 2024

  Answer: This is CORRECT behavior, not a bug!

  Explanation:
  - UB-YTX14-BS Burnaby historical data shows declining trend:
    - Apr 2025: 1105 units
    - May 2025: 979 units
    - Jun 2025: 974 units
    - Jul 2025: 887 units
    - Aug 2025: 806 units
    - Sep 2025: 693 units
  - Forecasting uses weighted moving average (70% recent 6 months, 30% older 6 months)
  - Recent declining trend + winter seasonal factors = lower forecast
  - This is the system correctly detecting downward demand trajectory

  Current System Architecture

  Backend (Python/FastAPI)

  - Database: MySQL via XAMPP, connection pooling with SQLAlchemy
  - Main Files:
    - backend/main.py - FastAPI application entry point
    - backend/forecasting.py - Core forecasting engine (ForecastEngine class)
    - backend/forecasting_api.py - API endpoints for forecasting
    - backend/forecast_jobs.py - Background job worker (threading-based)
    - backend/seasonal_calculator.py - Seasonal factor calculation
    - backend/database.py - Database connection utilities

  Frontend (Vanilla JS + jQuery + DataTables)

  - Main Files:
    - frontend/forecasting.html - Main forecasting dashboard
    - frontend/forecasting.js - Frontend logic (just fixed in V7.2.4)
  - Libraries: jQuery, DataTables, Chart.js, Bootstrap 5

  Key Business Logic

  Forecasting Methods by ABC/XYZ Classification:
  - AX, BX: Weighted MA (6 months, 70% recent, high confidence)
  - AY, BY: Weighted MA (3 months, 60% recent, medium confidence)
  - AZ, BZ: Simple MA (3 months, lower confidence)
  - CX: Simple MA (6 months)
  - CY, CZ: Simple MA (3 months, lowest confidence)

  Seasonal Factors:
  - Monthly adjustment factors (1-12) based on historical patterns
  - Warehouse-specific (burnaby, kentucky, combined)
  - Calculated from corrected_demand_burnaby and corrected_demand_kentucky columns

  Warehouse Support:
  - Three modes: 'burnaby', 'kentucky', 'combined'
  - Each forecast run stores warehouse in forecast_runs.warehouse column
  - Seasonal factors and historical comparisons use warehouse-specific data

  Known Issues / Limitations

  None Currently Outstanding

  All reported issues have been fixed through V7.2.4:
  - ✅ Burnaby under-forecasting → Fixed in V7.2.2 (warehouse-specific seasonal factors)
  - ✅ Historical comparison showing wrong data → Fixed in V7.2.2
  - ✅ Date sorting alphabetically → Fixed in V7.2.2
  - ✅ Missing warehouse column errors → Fixed in V7.2.3
  - ✅ CSC-R55 details button not working → Fixed in V7.2.4
  - ✅ UB-YTX14-BS forecasting logic confusion → Documented in V7.2.4

  Single-Threaded Limitation (By Design)

  - Only one forecast can run at a time (ForecastJobWorker is single-threaded)
  - Attempting to start second forecast while one is running → marked as failed with clear error message
  - This is expected behavior, not a bug

  Important Code Patterns to Remember

  Anti-Pattern to Avoid (Just Fixed in V7.2.4)

  NEVER DO THIS:
  onclick='myFunction(${JSON.stringify(data)})'

  Instead, use event delegation:
  // In HTML
  data-row-id="${id}"

  // In JavaScript
  $('#table tbody').on('click', 'button[data-row-id]', function() {
      const id = $(this).data('row-id');
      const fullData = dataTable.row(id).data();
      myFunction(fullData);
  });

  MySQL Reserved Keywords

  - year_month requires backticks: `year_month`
  - Use in WHERE clauses, ORDER BY, etc.

  Warehouse Parameter Pattern

  Always check if warehouse is 'combined' or specific:
  if warehouse == 'combined':
      sales_column = 'burnaby_sales + kentucky_sales'
  else:
      sales_column = f'{warehouse}_sales'
