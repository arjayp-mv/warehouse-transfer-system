# V7.0 12-Month Sales Forecasting System - FULLY OPERATIONAL

## Session Summary - 2025-10-18

This session successfully debugged and completed the V7.0 forecasting system implementation, resolving all critical bugs from previous sessions and achieving full end-to-end functionality.

---

## Critical Bugs Fixed

### 1. SQL Column Name Error (FIXED)
**File**: `backend/forecasting.py` lines 187-201
**Error**: `(1054, "Unknown column 'weighted_avg_burnaby' in 'field list'")`
**Location**: `_get_demand_from_stats()` method
**Root Cause**: Method was using non-existent columns `weighted_avg_burnaby` and `weighted_avg_kentucky`

**Before (Broken)**:
```python
def _get_demand_from_stats(self, sku_id: str, warehouse: str) -> float:
    if warehouse == 'combined':
        query = """
            SELECT (weighted_avg_burnaby + weighted_avg_kentucky) as avg_demand
            FROM sku_demand_stats
            WHERE sku_id = %s
        """
    else:
        column = f'weighted_avg_{warehouse}'
        query = f"""
            SELECT {column} as avg_demand
            FROM sku_demand_stats
            WHERE sku_id = %s
        """
```

**After (Fixed)**:
```python
def _get_demand_from_stats(self, sku_id: str, warehouse: str) -> float:
    """
    Fallback method to get demand from sku_demand_stats table.
    Uses demand_6mo_weighted which is the 6-month weighted moving average.
    """
    query = """
        SELECT demand_6mo_weighted as avg_demand
        FROM sku_demand_stats
        WHERE sku_id = %s AND warehouse = %s
    """
    result = execute_query(query, (sku_id, warehouse), fetch_all=True)
    return float(result[0]['avg_demand']) if result and result[0]['avg_demand'] else 0.0
```

**Impact**: Fixed at batch 7 (SKU AP-WE18X26) - previously all forecasts were failing at this point

### 2. Page Size Validation Error (FIXED)
**File**: `frontend/forecasting.js` line 222
**Error**: 422 Unprocessable Content when viewing results
**Root Cause**: Frontend was requesting `page_size=1000` but API enforces max of 100

**Fix**: Changed line 222 from:
```javascript
const response = await fetch(`${API_BASE}/runs/${runId}/results?page=1&page_size=1000`);
```

To:
```javascript
const response = await fetch(`${API_BASE}/runs/${runId}/results?page=1&page_size=100`);
```

**Impact**: Results view now loads successfully with proper pagination

### 3. Background Worker Improvements (COMPLETED)
From previous sessions, implemented comprehensive error handling:
- Added try-except wrapper around entire `_run_forecast_job()` method
- Added SKU list validation before starting jobs
- Enhanced logging at all critical points (run start, batch processing, completion, errors)
- Improved API error responses with specific exception types (ValueError, RuntimeError)

## Complete Workflow Test Results

### Test Forecast: "Fixed Test - All SKUs Combined"
- **Run ID**: 6
- **SKUs Processed**: 950/950 (100% success rate)
- **Failed SKUs**: 0
- **Execution Time**: 9.23 seconds
- **Status**: COMPLETED
- **Warehouse**: Combined (Burnaby + Kentucky)
- **Growth Rate**: 0%
- **ABC Filter**: None (all active SKUs)

### Batch Processing Performance
```
Batch 1/10 (100 SKUs): 1.23s - 100 processed, 0 failed
Batch 2/10 (100 SKUs): 1.07s - 200 processed, 0 failed
Batch 3/10 (100 SKUs): 0.88s - 300 processed, 0 failed
Batch 4/10 (100 SKUs): 0.97s - 400 processed, 0 failed

## Technical Stack Verification

### Backend (All Working)
- Python 3.x with FastAPI
- MySQL database with pymysql
- Background threading for job processing
- Comprehensive logging with timestamps
- Error handling with graceful degradation

### Frontend (All Working)
- Plain HTML/CSS with Bootstrap
- Vanilla JavaScript (no build process needed)
- DataTables for pagination and sorting
- Real-time progress polling (2-second intervals)

## Known Limitations & Future Enhancements

### Current Limitations
1. **Pagination Required**: Results display limited to 100 items per page (API enforces this)
2. **No Manual Adjustments**: Cannot manually override forecast values yet
3. **Single Warehouse View**: Results show "combined" warehouse only in current test
4. **No Comparison Views**: Cannot compare multiple forecast runs side-by-side

### Recommended Future Enhancements
1. **Forecast Comparison**: Compare current vs. previous runs
2. **Manual Adjustments**: Allow users to override specific SKU forecasts
3. **Warehouse Breakdown**: Show Burnaby vs. Kentucky split in results
4. **Forecast Accuracy Tracking**: Compare forecasts vs. actual sales over time
5. **Advanced Filters**: Filter results by seasonal pattern, confidence level
6. **Excel Export**: Add XLSX export option in addition to CSV
