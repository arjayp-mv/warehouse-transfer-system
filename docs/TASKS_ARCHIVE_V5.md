**Database Schema**:
```sql
-- supplier_shipments table
CREATE TABLE supplier_shipments (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    po_number VARCHAR(50) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    supplier_name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    order_date DATE NOT NULL,
    expected_delivery DATE,
    actual_delivery DATE,
    lead_time_days INT,
    on_time BOOLEAN,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

-- Performance indexes
CREATE INDEX idx_supplier_name ON supplier_shipments(supplier_name);
CREATE INDEX idx_order_date ON supplier_shipments(order_date);
