## V6.0: Sales Analytics Dashboard Enhancement

### Feature Overview
Comprehensive enhancement of the sales analytics dashboard to fix critical calculation issues and add missing analytics features as specified in the Product Requirements Document (PRD). This implementation addressed user-reported issues and added advanced analytics capabilities for inventory optimization and strategic planning.

### Critical Issues Addressed
- **Average Monthly Revenue displays $0**: API returned wrong data structure for frontend
- **Stockout Impact shows $0**: No stockout loss calculation being performed
- **ABC-XYZ Matrix empty**: Chart defined but no data loaded or visualization
- **Missing All SKUs view**: Only top 50 SKUs visible, users needed comprehensive listing

### Phase 1: Database Enhancements

**Completed Tasks**:
- [x] TASK-176: Create sales_analytics_migration.sql with performance indexes and materialized views
- [x] TASK-177: Execute migration script to add database optimizations
- [x] TASK-178: Verify new views and indexes are created successfully
- [x] TASK-179: Test performance impact with sample queries

**Database Improvements**:
```sql
-- Materialized views for performance
CREATE VIEW v_sku_performance_summary AS
SELECT
    s.sku_id,
    SUM(sh.quantity_sold) as total_units,
    SUM(sh.revenue) as total_revenue,
    AVG(sh.revenue) as avg_monthly_revenue,
    -- ... additional metrics
FROM skus s
JOIN sales_history sh ON s.sku_id = sh.sku_id
GROUP BY s.sku_id;

-- Performance indexes
CREATE INDEX idx_sales_sku_date ON sales_history(sku_id, sale_date);
CREATE INDEX idx_abc_xyz ON skus(abc_class, xyz_class);
```

### Phase 2: Backend Calculation Fixes

**Key Algorithm**: Stockout Loss Calculation
```python
def calculate_stockout_loss(sku_id, months=12):
    # Get actual sales
    actual_sales = get_sales_data(sku_id, months)

    # Get stockout-corrected demand
    corrected_demand = apply_stockout_correction(actual_sales)

    # Lost revenue = (corrected - actual) * avg_price

## V6.2: Sales Dashboard Data Issues & Missing Features

### Issues Identified
Critical issues found during user testing:

1. **Seasonal Analysis Limited SKU Dropdown**: Only shows top 20 revenue performers instead of all active SKUs
2. **All SKUs Performance Missing SKUs**: Only displays 950 Active SKUs, excludes 818 Death Row/Discontinued SKUs
3. **Stockout Impact Pareto Chart Empty**: Shows "no significant stockout" despite 293 SKUs with 17,649 stockout days

### Root Cause Analysis
- **Seasonal SKU Dropdown**: Using top-performers API limited to 20 SKUs
- **All SKUs Count**: v_sku_performance_summary view filters WHERE status = 'Active' only
- **Stockout Impact**: min_impact threshold (default $100) filters out all affected SKUs

### Phase 1: API & Backend Fixes

**Completed Tasks**:
- [x] TASK-260: Add /api/sales/active-skus endpoint for dropdown population with all active SKUs
- [x] TASK-261: Create v_all_skus_performance view including Death Row and Discontinued status
- [x] TASK-262: Add status filter parameter to /api/sales/all-skus endpoint for UI toggle
- [x] TASK-263: Modify stockout impact calculation to use min_impact=0 instead of $100 default
- [x] TASK-264: Add top N parameter to stockout impact to show at least 20 SKUs regardless of threshold
- [x] TASK-265: Update API documentation with new endpoint and parameter changes

**API Enhancements**:
```python
# New endpoint for all active SKUs
@app.get("/api/sales/active-skus")
async def get_active_skus():
    return {"skus": [...]}  # All 950 active SKUs

# Enhanced stockout impact with configurable threshold
@app.get("/api/sales/stockout-impact")
async def get_stockout_impact(
    min_impact: float = 0.0,  # Changed from 100
    top_n: int = 100
):
    return {"affected_skus": [...]}
```

### Phases 2-7: Implementation Complete

## V6.3: Stockout Impact Analysis Chart Data Structure Fix

### Problem Identified
The Stockout Impact Analysis (Pareto Chart) was not displaying any data despite the backend API returning valid stockout data. Root cause: **data structure mismatch** between backend and frontend.

**Backend Returned**:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": [
    {"sku_id": "AP-2198597", "lost_sales": "12749.07", ...}
  ]
}
```

**Frontend Expected**:
```javascript
{
  affected_skus: [
    {sku_id: "...", estimated_lost_revenue: 12749.07, ...}
  ],
  total_estimated_loss: 50000
}
```

### Phase 1: Backend API Data Structure Transformation

**Completed Tasks**:
- [x] TASK-298: Transform /api/sales/stockout-impact endpoint response structure in sales_api.py
- [x] TASK-299: Map backend field names to match frontend expectations (lost_sales → estimated_lost_revenue)
- [x] TASK-300: Calculate total_estimated_loss from individual SKU lost sales
- [x] TASK-301: Ensure response structure matches frontend renderStockoutParetoChart expectations
- [x] TASK-302: Add comprehensive error handling for edge cases (no stockout data)

**Solution Implemented**:
```python
# Transform response structure
response = {
    "affected_skus": [
        {
            "sku_id": item["sku_id"],
            "estimated_lost_revenue": float(item["lost_sales"]),
            # ... other fields
        }
        for item in stockout_data
    ],
    "total_estimated_loss": sum(float(item["lost_sales"]) for item in stockout_data)
}
```

### Phases 2-5: Testing and Documentation

    kentucky_metrics = self._calculate_individual_warehouse_metrics(sku_id, 'Kentucky')

    return {
        'burnaby': burnaby_metrics,
        'kentucky': kentucky_metrics
    }

# Fixed field naming
performance_metrics = {
    'total_units': total_sales_units,  # was total_sales_units
    'avg_monthly_units': avg_monthly_sales,  # was avg_monthly_sales
    # ...
}
```
