## Understanding the Transfer Planning Impact

### Before Pending Orders:
```
Kentucky Stock: 100 units
Monthly Demand: 150 units
Coverage: 0.67 months ‚Üí CRITICAL PRIORITY
```

### After Adding Pending Orders:
```
Kentucky Stock: 100 units
Pending Orders: 400 units arriving in 45 days
Projected Coverage: 3.33 months ‚Üí MEDIUM PRIORITY
```

### Burnaby Retention Logic:
The system ensures Burnaby maintains adequate stock:
- **Minimum Coverage**: Never goes below 2.0 months
- **Target Coverage**: Maintains 6.0 months when possible
- **With Pending Orders**: Can reduce to 1.5 months if orders arrive within 45 days

## Advanced Features

Set custom lead times for different suppliers:

**Navigation**: Settings ‚Üí Supplier Lead Times

```csv
sku_id,quantity,destination,expected_date
CHG-001,500,kentucky,2025-12-15
CBL-002,300,burnaby,
```
**Result**: CHG-001 confirmed for Dec 15, CBL-002 estimated for +120 days

**Scenario 2: No Date Column**
```csv

## Best Practices

### üìä Data Quality

1. **Keep SKU IDs accurate**: System validates against master SKU list
2. **Use consistent date formats**: YYYY-MM-DD works best
3. **Update confirmed dates**: Convert estimates to actuals when available
4. **Regular cleanup**: Remove received/cancelled orders periodically

### üîÑ Workflow Integration

1. **Weekly Updates**: Import new pending orders weekly
2. **Date Confirmations**: Update estimated dates when shipping details available
3. **Transfer Planning**: Run enhanced calculations before transfer decisions
4. **Status Tracking**: Mark orders as shipped/received as they progress

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Issues

**Issue**: "SKU not found" errors
**Solution**: Ensure SKU IDs match exactly (case-sensitive)

**Issue**: "Invalid destination" warnings
**Solution**: Use only 'burnaby' or 'kentucky' (lowercase)

**Issue**: Import shows 0 records
**Solution**: Check required columns: sku_id, quantity, destination

**Issue**: Dates not parsing correctly
**Solution**: Use YYYY-MM-DD format or leave blank for auto-calculation

## Troubleshooting

### Import Issues

**Problem**: CSV import fails completely
**Check**:
1. File format is CSV (not Excel)
2. Required columns present: sku_id, quantity, destination
3. File size under 10MB

**Problem**: Some rows skipped during import
**Check**:
1. SKU IDs exist in system and are active
2. Quantities are positive integers
3. Destinations are 'burnaby' or 'kentucky'

### Transfer Planning Issues

**Problem**: Recommendations don't seem to consider pending orders
**Solution**:
1. Ensure using "Enhanced Calculations" mode
2. Check pending orders are in 'ordered', 'shipped', or 'pending' status
3. Verify pending orders have future arrival dates

**Problem**: Burnaby showing unexpected transfer restrictions
**Explanation**: Burnaby retention logic prevents over-transferring. Check:
1. Current Burnaby coverage levels
2. Pending orders arriving within 45 days
3. Configuration settings for minimum coverage

### Configuration Issues

**Problem**: Supplier lead times not applying
**Check**:
1. Supplier name matches exactly (case-sensitive)
2. Destination specified if supplier has multiple lead times
3. System restart may be required after configuration changes

## FAQ

**Q: What happens if I import the same pending order twice?**
A: The system will create duplicate entries. Best practice is to clear old data before importing updates.

A: Currently, editing is done through re-import. Delete and re-import for corrections.

**Q: How does the system handle cancelled orders?**
A: Set status to 'cancelled' or delete the pending order record.

**Q: What's the difference between 'estimated' and 'confirmed' dates?**
A: Estimated dates are auto-calculated (shown with icons), confirmed dates are provided by you and considered more reliable.

**Q: Can I use this for internal transfers between warehouses?**
A: Yes, set order_type to 'transfer' for internal movements.

**Q: How often should I update pending orders?**
A: Weekly updates are recommended, with date confirmations as shipping information becomes available.
